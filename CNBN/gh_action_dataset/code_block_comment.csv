# Instead of installing gems from rubygems, we can run `bundle install` on your project,

# Valid Options: A reasonably sized string.

# Description: Versions required to run your RuboCop checks.

# Description: RuboCop configuration file path relative to the workspace.
# Valid options: A valid file path inside of the workspace.

# Whether or not to use --force-exclusion when building the rubocop command. Use this if you are only linting modified
# files and typically excluded files have been changed. For example, if you exclude db/schema.rb in your rubocop.yml
# but a change gets made, then with the check_scope config set to \'modified\' rubocop will lint db/schema.rb. If you set
# this to true, rubocop will ignore it.
# Valid options: true || false

# Instead of installing gems from rubygems, we can run `bundle install` on your project,

# The scope of code that RuboCop should lint. Use this if you only want to lint changed files. If this is not set
