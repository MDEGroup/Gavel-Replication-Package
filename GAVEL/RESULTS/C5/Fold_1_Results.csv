# Checkout V3

This action checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.

Only a single commit is fetched by default, for the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow. Set `fetch-depth: 0` to fetch all history for all branches and tags. Refer [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) to learn which commit `$GITHUB_SHA` points to for different events.

The auth token is persisted in the local git config. This enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The token is removed during post-job cleanup. Set `persist-credentials: false` to opt-out.

When Git 2.18 or higher is not in your PATH, falls back to the REST API to download the files.

# What\'s new

- Updated to the node16 runtime by default
  - This requires a minimum [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.285.0) version of v2.285.0 to run, which is by default available in GHES 3.4 or later.

This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

- Installing a version of Python or PyPy and (by default) adding it to the PATH
- Optionally caching dependencies for pip, pipenv and poetry
- Registering problem matchers for error output

## Basic usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

**Python**
```yaml
```

**PyPy**
```yaml
```
The `python-version` input is optional. If not supplied, the action will try to resolve the version from the default `.python-version` file. If the `.python-version` file doesn't exist Python or PyPy version from the PATH will be used. The default version of Python or PyPy in PATH varies between runners and can be changed unexpectedly so we recommend always setting Python version explicitly using the `python-version` or `python-version-file` inputs.

The action will first check the local [tool cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#hosted-tool-cache) for a [semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#versions) match. If unable to find a specific version in the tool cache, the action will attempt to download a version of Python from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/actions/python-versions/releases) and for PyPy from the official [PyPy's dist](https://downloads.python.org/pypy/).

For information regarding locally cached versions of Python or PyPy on GitHub hosted runners, check out [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).

## Supported version syntax

The `python-version` input supports the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) and some special version notations (e.g. `semver ranges`, `x.y-dev syntax`, etc.), for detailed examples please refer to the section: [Using python-version input](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-input) of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) guide.

## Supported architectures

Using `architecture` input it is possible to specify the required Python or PyPy interpreter architecture: `x86` or `x64`. If the input is not specified the architecture defaults to `x64`.

## Caching packages dependencies

The action has built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood for caching dependencies but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are `pip`, `pipenv` and `poetry`. The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.

The action defaults to searching for a dependency file (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for pip, `Pipfile.lock` for pipenv or `poetry.lock` for poetry) in the repository, and uses its hash as a part of the cache key. Input `cache-dependency-path` is used for cases when multiple dependency files are used, they are located in different subdirectories or different files for the hash that want to be used.

 - For `pip`, the action will cache the global cache directory
 - For `pipenv`, the action will cache virtualenv directory
 - For `poetry`, the action will cache virtualenv directories -- one for each poetry project found

**Caching pip dependencies:**

```yaml
```
>**Note:** Restored cache will not be used if the requirements.txt file is not updated for a long time and a newer version of the dependency is available which can lead to an increase in total build time.

>The requirements file format allows for specifying dependency versions using logical operators (for example chardet>=3.0.4) or specifying dependencies without any versions. In this case the pip install -r requirements.txt command will always try to install the latest available package version. To be sure that the cache will be used, please stick to a specific dependency version and update it manually if necessary.

See examples of using `cache` and `cache-dependency-path` for `pipenv` and `poetry` in the section: [Caching packages](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages) of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) guide.

[![Main workflow](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/actions)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml/actions)

**STATUS: STABLE**

Set up an OCaml and opam environment in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and add to PATH.

## Usage

### Example workflow

Consult the
[Hello World OCaml Action](https://github.com/avsm/hello-world-action-ocaml)
that uses Dune and opam to build a simple library.

It\'s possible to feed different values to the input depending on the platform of
the runner. The syntax of GitHub\'s workflows is flexible enough to offer several
methods to do this.

```yml
```

### Versioning

The actions are downloaded and run from the GitHub graph of repositories. The
workflow references an action using a ref.

> **Note** Binding to a major version is the latest of that major version (e.g.
> `v2` = `2.*`)
>
> Major versions should guarantee compatibility. A major version can add net new
> capabilities but should not break existing input compatibility or break
> existing workflows.

```yml
```

> **Warning** do not reference `master` since that is the latest code and can be
> carrying breaking changes of the next major version.

Major version binding allows you to take advantage of bug fixes and critical
functionality and security fixes. The `master` branch has the latest code and is
unstable to bind to since changes get committed to the `master` and released by
creating a tag.

```yml
```

### Supported version syntax

The `ocaml-compiler` input supports the Semantic Versioning Specification, for
more detailed examples please refer to the
[documentation](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges).

> **Note** With the naughty exception of `4.02.2`, point releases are meant to
> be strictly compatible, so once we (OCaml dev team) release a new point
> release, upgrading should be a no-brainer.

Examples:

- Exact package name: `ocaml-base-compiler.5.0.0`,
  `ocaml-variants.4.14.0+mingw64c`
- Combine multiple packages:
  `ocaml-variants.5.0.0+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-musl,ocaml-option-static`
- Minor versions: `4.08`, `4.14`, `5.0`, `5.0.x`
- More specific versions: `~4.02.2`, `5.0.0`,

## Advanced Configurations

Consult the [examples](examples.md) page for more complex patterns.

## Extends

**STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL**

Note: All extends are recommended to use in separate jobs run on
`ubuntu-latest`.

- [deploy-doc](deploy-doc)
- [lint-doc](lint-doc)
- [lint-fmt](lint-fmt)
- [lint-opam](lint-opam)

## Automatically updating the actions with Dependabot

Consult the
[Configuring Dependabot version updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)
page and set `.github/dependabot.yml` as described below to allow Dependabot to
update the actions automatically.

```yml
```

> **Note** [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate) is also available
> for free as a third-party tool, which is much more flexible than Dependabot -
> depending on the project and your preferences. If you just want to automate
> GitHub Actions updates, Dependabot is good enough.

## Roadmap

This action aims to provide an OS-neutral interface to `opam`, and so will not
add features that only work on one operating system. It will also track the
latest stable release of opam.

3,"# Upload-Artifact v3

This uploads artifacts from your workflow allowing you to share data between jobs and store data once a workflow is complete.

See also [download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact).

# What\'s new

- Easier upload
  - Specify a wildcard pattern
  - Specify an individual file
  - Specify a directory (previously you were limited to only this option)
  - Multi path upload
    - Use a combination of individual files, wildcards or directories
    - Support for excluding certain files
- Upload an artifact without providing a name
- Fix for artifact uploads sometimes not working with containers
- Proxy support out of the box
- Port entire action to typescript from a runner plugin so it is easier to collaborate and accept contributions

Refer [here](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/releases/v1) for the previous version

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

### Upload an Individual File

```yaml
```

### Upload an Entire Directory

```yaml
```

### Upload using a Wildcard Pattern

```yaml
```

### Upload using Multiple Paths and Exclusions

```yaml
```

For supported wildcards along with behavior and documentation, see [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) which is used internally to search for files.

If a wildcard pattern is used, the path hierarchy will be preserved after the first wildcard pattern:

```
```

If multiple paths are provided as input, the least common ancestor of all the search paths will be used as the root directory of the artifact. Exclude paths do not affect the directory structure.

Relative and absolute file paths are both allowed. Relative paths are rooted against the current working directory. Paths that begin with a wildcard character should be quoted to avoid being interpreted as YAML aliases.

The [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) package is used internally to handle most of the logic around uploading an artifact. There is extra documentation around upload limitations and behavior in the toolkit repo that is worth checking out.

### Customization if no files are found

If a path (or paths), result in no files being found for the artifact, the action will succeed but print out a warning. In certain scenarios it may be desirable to fail the action or suppress the warning. The `if-no-files-found` option allows you to customize the behavior of the action if no files are found:

```yaml
```

### Conditional Artifact Upload

To upload artifacts only when the previous step of a job failed, use [`if: failure()`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions):

```yaml
```

### Uploading without an artifact name

You can upload an artifact without specifying a name

```yaml
```

If not provided, `artifact` will be used as the default name which will manifest itself in the UI after upload.

### Uploading to the same artifact

With the following example, the available artifact (named `artifact` by default if no name is provided) would contain both `world.txt` (`hello`) and `extra-file.txt` (`howdy`):

```yaml
```

Each artifact behaves as a file share. Uploading to the same artifact multiple times in the same workflow can overwrite and append already uploaded files:

```yaml
```

> **_Warning:_** Be careful when uploading to the same artifact via multiple jobs as artifacts may become corrupted. When uploading a file with an identical name and path in multiple jobs, uploads may fail with 503 errors due to conflicting uploads happening at the same time. Ensure uploads to identical locations to not interfere with each other.

In the above example, four jobs will upload four different files to the same artifact but there will only be one file available when `my-artifact` is downloaded. Each job overwrites what was previously uploaded. To ensure that jobs don\'t overwrite existing artifacts, use a different name per job:

```yaml
```

### Environment Variables and Tilde Expansion

You can use `~` in the path input as a substitute for `$HOME`. Basic tilde expansion is supported:

```yaml
```

Environment variables along with context expressions can also be used for input. For documentation see [context and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions):

```yaml
```

For environment variables created in other steps, make sure to use the `env` expression syntax

```yaml
```

### Retention Period

Artifacts are retained for 90 days by default. You can specify a shorter retention period using the `retention-days` input:

```yaml
```

The retention period must be between 1 and 90 inclusive. For more information see [artifact and log retention policies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy).

## Where does the upload go?

At the bottom of the workflow summary page, there is a dedicated section for artifacts. Here\'s a screenshot of something you might see:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16109154/103645952-223c6880-4f59-11eb-8268-8dca6937b5f9.png"" width=""700"" height=""300"">

There is a trashcan icon that can be used to delete the artifact. This icon will only appear for users who have write permissions to the repository.

The size of the artifact is denoted in bytes. The displayed artifact size denotes the raw uploaded artifact size (the sum of all the individual files uploaded during the workflow run for the artifact), not the compressed size. When you click to download an artifact from the summary page, a compressed zip is created with all the contents of the artifact and the size of the zip that you download may differ significantly from the displayed size. Billing is based on the raw uploaded size and not the size of the zip.

# Limitations

### Zipped Artifact Downloads

During a workflow run, files are uploaded and downloaded individually using the `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions. However, when a workflow run finishes and an artifact is downloaded from either the UI or through the [download api](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/artifacts/#download-an-artifact), a zip is dynamically created with all the file contents that were uploaded. There is currently no way to download artifacts after a workflow run finishes in a format other than a zip or to download artifact contents individually. One of the consequences of this limitation is that if a zip is uploaded during a workflow run and then downloaded from the UI, there will be a double zip created.

### Permission Loss

:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.

### Case Insensitive Uploads

:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.

### Maintaining file permissions and case sensitive files

If file permissions and case sensitivity are required, you can `tar` all of your files together before artifact upload. Post download, the `tar` file will maintain file permissions and case sensitivity:

```yaml
```

### Too many uploads resulting in 429 responses

A very minute subset of users who upload a very very large amount of artifacts in a short period of time may see their uploads throttled or fail because of `Request was blocked due to exceeding usage of resource \'DBCPU\' in namespace` or `Unable to copy file to server StatusCode=TooManyRequests`.

To reduce the chance of this happening, you can reduce the number of HTTP calls made during artifact upload by zipping or archiving the contents of your artifact before an upload starts. As an example, imagine an artifact with 1000 files (each 10 Kb in size). Without any modification, there would be around 1000 HTTP calls made to upload the artifact. If you zip or archive the artifact beforehand, the number of HTTP calls can be dropped to single digit territory. Measures like this will significantly speed up your upload and prevent uploads from being throttled or in some cases fail.

This is a **GitHub Action** to deploy your static files to **GitHub Pages**.
This deploy action can be combined simply and freely with [Static Site Generators]. (Hugo, MkDocs, Gatsby, mdBook, Next, Nuxt, and so on.)

[Static Site Generators]: https://jamstack.org/generators/

The next example step will deploy `./public` directory to the remote `gh-pages` branch.

```yaml
```

For newbies of GitHub Actions:
Note that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is **NOT** a personal access token.
A GitHub Actions runner automatically creates a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to authenticate in your workflow.
So, you can start to deploy immediately without any configuration.



## Supported Tokens

Three tokens are supported.

| Token | Private repo | Public repo | Protocol | Setup |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| `github_token` | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | HTTPS | Unnecessary |
| `deploy_key` | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | SSH | Necessary |
| `personal_token` | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | HTTPS | Necessary |

Notes: Actually, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` works for deploying to GitHub Pages but it has still some limitations.
For the first deployment, we need to select the `gh-pages` branch or another branch on the repository settings tab.
See [First Deployment with `GITHUB_TOKEN`](#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token)



## Supported Platforms

All Actions runners: Linux (Ubuntu), macOS, and Windows are supported.

| runs-on | `github_token` | `deploy_key` | `personal_token` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ubuntu-22.04 | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |
| ubuntu-20.04 | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |
| ubuntu-latest | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |
| macos-latest | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |
| windows-latest | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | (2) | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |

2. WIP, See [Issue #87](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/87)



## GitHub Enterprise Server Support

\xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f GitHub Enterprise Server is supported above `2.22.6`.

Note that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that is created by the runner might not inherently have push/publish privileges on GHES. You might need to create/request a technical user with write permissions to your target repository.

## Getting started

Add your workflow file `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` and push it to your remote default branch.

Here is an example workflow for Hugo.

- [peaceiris/actions-hugo: GitHub Actions for Hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo)

</div>



## Options

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set Runner\'s Access Token `github_token`

**This option is for `GITHUB_TOKEN`, not a personal access token.**

A GitHub Actions runner automatically creates a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to use in your workflow. You can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate in a workflow run.

```yaml
```

For more details about `GITHUB_TOKEN`: [Automatic token authentication - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set SSH Private Key `deploy_key`

Read [Create SSH Deploy Key](#%EF%B8%8F-create-ssh-deploy-key), create your SSH deploy key, and set the `deploy_key` option like the following.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set Personal Access Token `personal_token`

[Generate a personal access token (`repo`)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and add it to Secrets as `PERSONAL_TOKEN`, it works as well as `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set Another GitHub Pages Branch `publish_branch`

Set a branch name to use as GitHub Pages branch.
The default is `gh-pages`.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Source Directory `publish_dir`

A source directory to deploy to GitHub Pages. The default is `public`.
Only the contents of this dir are pushed to GitHub Pages branch, `gh-pages` by default.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Deploy to Subdirectory `destination_dir`

*This feature is on beta.*
*Any feedback is welcome at [Issue #324](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/324)*

A destination subdirectory on a publishing branch. The default is empty.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Filter publishing assets `exclude_assets`

*This feature is on beta.*
*Any feedback is welcome at [Issue #163](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/163)*

Set files or directories to exclude from publishing assets.
The default is `.github`.
Values should be split with a comma.

```yaml
```

Set `exclude_assets` to empty for including the `.github` directory to deployment assets.

```yaml
```

The `exclude_assets` option supports glob patterns.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Add CNAME file `cname`

To add the `CNAME` file, we can set the `cname` option.
Alternatively, put your `CNAME` file into your `publish_dir`. (e.g. `public/CNAME`)

For more details about the `CNAME` file, read the official documentation: [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

```yaml
    cname: github.com
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Enable Built-in Jekyll `enable_jekyll`

If you want GitHub Pages to process your site with the static site generator Jekyll, set `enable_jekyll` to true.

By default, this action signals to GitHub Pages that the site shall not be processed with Jekyll. This is done by adding an empty `.nojekyll` file on your publishing branch. When that file already exists, this action does nothing.

Bypassing Jekyll makes the deployment faster and is necessary if you are deploying files or directories that start with underscores, since Jekyll considers these to be special resources and does not copy them to the final site. You only need to set `enable_jekyll` to true when you want to deploy a Jekyll-powered website and let GitHub Pages do the Jekyll processing.


```yaml
    enable_jekyll: true
```

For more details about `.nojekyll`: [Bypassing Jekyll on GitHub Pages - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/)

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Allow empty commits `allow_empty_commit`

By default, a commit will not be generated when no file changes. If you want to allow an empty commit, set the optional parameter `allow_empty_commit` to `true`.

For example:

```yaml
    allow_empty_commit: true
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Keeping existing files `keep_files`

By default, existing files in the publish branch (or only in `destination_dir` if given) will be removed. If you want the action to add new files but leave existing ones untouched, set the optional parameter `keep_files` to `true`.

Note that users who are using a Static Site Generator do not need this option in most cases. Please reconsider your project structure and building scripts, or use a built-in feature of a Static Site Generator before you enable this flag.

- [Static Files | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/static-files/)
- [Using the Static Folder | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/static-folder/)

For example:

```yaml
    keep_files: true
```

With the v3, this option does not support working with the force_orphan option. The next major release (version 4) will support this.
See [the issue #455](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/455)

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Deploy to external repository `external_repository`

By default, your files are published to the repository which is running this action.
If you want to publish to another repository on GitHub, set the environment variable `external_repository` to `<username>/<external-repository>`.

For example:

```yaml
```

You can use `deploy_key` or `personal_token`.
When you use `deploy_key`, set your private key to the repository which includes this action and set your public key to your external repository.

**Note that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has no permission to access to external repositories. Please create a personal access token and set it to `personal_token` like `personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}`.**

Use case:

A GitHub Free Plan account cannot use the GitHub Pages in a private repository. To make your source contents private and deploy it with the GitHub Pages, you can deploy your site from a private repository to a public repository using this option.

- `peaceiris/homepage`: A private repository running this action with `external_repository: peaceiris/peaceiris.github.io`
- `peaceiris/peaceiris.github.io`: A public repository using GitHub Pages

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Force orphan `force_orphan`

We can set the `force_orphan: true` option.
This allows you to make your publish branch with only the latest commit.

```yaml
    force_orphan: true
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set Git username and email

Set custom `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
A commit is always created with the same user.

```yaml
    user_name: \'github-actions[bot]\'
    user_email: \'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\'
```

<img width=""400px"" alt=""Add GitHub Actions bot as a committer"" src=""./images/committer_github_actions_bot.jpg"">

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set custom commit message

Set a custom commit message.
When we create a commit with a message `docs: Update some post`, a deployment commit will be generated with a message `docs: Update some post ${GITHUB_SHA}`.

```yaml
    commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
```

<img width=""400px"" alt=""Set a custom commit message - GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages"" src=""./images/commit_message.jpg"">

To set a full custom commit message without a triggered commit hash,
use the `full_commit_message` option instead of the `commit_message` option.

```yaml
    full_commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Create Git tag

Here is an example workflow.

```yaml
```

## Tips and FAQ

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Create SSH Deploy Key

Generate your deploy key with the following command.

```sh
```

You will get 2 files:

- `gh-pages.pub` is a public key
- `gh-pages` is a private key

Next, Go to **Repository Settings**

- Go to **Deploy Keys** and add your public key with the **Allow write access**
- Go to **Secrets** and add your private key as `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`

| Add your public key | Success |
|---|---|
| ![](./images/deploy-keys-1.jpg) | ![](./images/deploy-keys-2.jpg) |

| Add your private key | Success |
|---|---|
| ![](./images/secrets-1.jpg) | ![](./images/secrets-2.jpg) |

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f First Deployment with `GITHUB_TOKEN`

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limitations for the first deployment so we have to select the GitHub Pages branch on the repository settings tab. After that, do the second deployment like the following pictures.

| First deployment failed | Go to the settings tab |
|---|---|
| ![](./images/log_first_deployment_failed_with_github_token.jpg) | ![](./images/settings_inactive.jpg) |

| Select branch | Deploying again and succeed |
|---|---|
| ![](./images/settings_select.jpg) | ![](./images/log_success.jpg) |

If the action fails to push the commit or tag with the following error:

```txt
```

Please add the write permission to the [`permissions.contents` in a workflow/job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions).

```yaml
```

Alternatively, you can [configure the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions) by selecting read and write permissions.


### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Use the latest and specific release

We recommend you to use the latest and specific release of this action for stable CI/CD.
It is useful to watch this repository (release only) to check the [latest release] of this action.

[latest release]: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/releases

For continuous updating, we can use the GitHub native Dependabot.
Here is an example configuration of the bot. The config file is located in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Schedule and Manual Deployment

For deploying regularly, we can set the `on.schedule` workflow trigger.
See [Scheduled events | Events that trigger workflows - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)

For deploying manually, we can set the `on.workflow_dispatch` workflow trigger.
See [Manual events `workflow_dispatch` | Events that trigger workflows - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#manual-events)

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Release Strategy

cf. [support: execution from hashref disabled/broken vs GitHub Actions Security Best Practice? \xc2\xb7 Issue #712 \xc2\xb7 peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/712)

Our project builds and provides build assets only when creating a release. This is to prevent the user from executing this action with a specific branch (like main). For example, if we maintain build assets in the main branch and users use this action as follows, a major release including breaking changes will break the CI workflow of the users silently.

```yaml
```

In this project, a major tag (e.g. v3) is guaranteed to contain no breaking changes. But, we recommend using a tag or a commit hash for the stability of your workflows.

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

For verifying the release asset, we can use the following commands.

```sh
```

## Usage

Executing remote ssh commands.

```yaml
```

output:

```sh
```

### Setting up a SSH Key

Make sure to follow the below steps while creating SSH Keys and using them.
The best practice is create the SSH Keys on local machine not remote machine.
Login with username specified in Github Secrets. Generate a RSA Key-Pair:

### Generate rsa key

```bash
```

### Generate ed25519 key

```bash
```

Add newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).

### Add rsa key into Authorized keys

```bash
```

### Add ed25519 key into Authorized keys

```bash
```

Copy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.

### Copy rsa Private key

```bash
```

### Copy ed25519 Private key

```bash
```

See the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).

**A note** from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:

* Put the public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys2`
* Change the permissions of `.ssh` to 700
* Change the permissions of `.ssh/authorized_keys2` to 640

### If you are using OpenSSH

If you are currently using OpenSSH and are getting the following error:

```bash
```

Make sure that your key algorithm of choice is supported. On Ubuntu 20.04 or later you must explicitly allow the use of the ssh-rsa algorithm. Add the following line to your OpenSSH daemon file (which is either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or a drop-in file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):

```bash
```

Alternatively, `ed25519` keys are accepted by default in OpenSSH. You could use this instead of rsa if needed:

```bash
```

### Example

#### Executing remote ssh commands using password

```yaml
```

#### Using private key

```yaml
```

#### Multiple Commands

```yaml
```

![result](./images/output-result.png)

#### Multiple Hosts

```diff
```

#### Multiple hosts with different port

```diff
```

#### Synchronous execution on multiple hosts

```diff
```

#### Pass environment variable to shell script

```diff
```

_Inside `env` object, you need to pass every environment variable as a string, passing `Integer` data type or any other may output unexpected results._

#### Stop script after first failure

> ex: missing `abc` folder

```diff
```

output:

```sh
```

#### How to connect remote server using `ProxyCommand`?

```bash
```

in your `~/.ssh/config`, you will see the following.

```bash
```

#### How to convert to YAML format of GitHubActions

```diff
```

#### Protecting a Private Key

The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key.
This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker.
It is not uncommon for files to leak from backups or decommissioned hardware, and hackers commonly exfiltrate files from compromised systems.

```diff
```

#### Using host fingerprint verification

Setting up SSH host fingerprint verification can help to prevent Person-in-the-Middle attacks. Before setting this up, run the command below to get your SSH host fingerprint. Remember to replace `ed25519` with your appropriate key type (`rsa`, `dsa`, etc.) that your server is using and `example.com` with your host.

In modern OpenSSH releases, the _default_ key types to be fetched are `rsa` (since version 5.1), `ecdsa` (since version 6.0), and `ed25519` (since version 6.7).

```sh
```

Now you can adjust you config:

```diff
```

\xf0\x9f\x93\x9dAutomatically fixes typos and mistakes in your source code and docs!

Based on awesome [misspell-fixer](https://github.com/vlajos/misspell-fixer) tool.


## Usage

We had a typo in our `entrypoint.sh` file to show how this GitHub Action works.
By using a pipeline of three actions we are able to receive [PRs like this one](https://github.com/sobolevn/misspell-fixer-action/pull/3).

Here's how our configuration looks like:

```yml
```

Here's how it works:

1. The first [`actions/checkout@v2`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action checkouts our code from the repo
2. Our own `sobolevn/misspell-fixer-action` finds misspells and fixes them
3. Then [`peter-evans/create-pull-request`](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) creates a PR with the fixes created earlier
4. Done!

Here's how our [workflow looks like](https://github.com/sobolevn/misspell-fixer-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/misspell.yml).


## Options and outputs

You can pass any options that are supported by `misspell-fixer` tool,
to do so you can use `options` key:

```yml
```

You can also use the output produced by this action by default.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
   - untracked (new) files
   - tracked (modified) files
   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.

You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v5.x.x`

### Workflow permissions

For this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests.
This setting can be found in a repository\'s settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.

For repositories belonging to an organization, this setting can be managed by admins in organization settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.

### Action inputs

All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: push` or `on: pull_request` workflow then you cannot use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.

### Action outputs

The following outputs can be used by subsequent workflow steps.

- `pull-request-number` - The pull request number.
- `pull-request-url` - The URL of the pull request.
- `pull-request-operation` - The pull request operation performed by the action, `created`, `updated` or `closed`.
- `pull-request-head-sha` - The commit SHA of the pull request branch.

Step outputs can be accessed as in the following example.
Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

```yml
```

### Action behaviour

The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.
Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.
Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.
- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
- If a pull request already exists it will be updated if necessary. Local changes in the Actions workspace, or changes on the base branch, can cause an update. If no update is required the action exits silently.
- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.

For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).

#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch

For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.
This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.

- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`

- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`

- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`

### Controlling committed files

The action defaults to adding all new and modified files.
If there are files that should not be included in the pull request, you can use the following methods to control the committed content.

#### Remove files

The most straightforward way to handle unwanted files is simply to remove them in a step before the action runs.

```yml
```

#### Ignore files

If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

#### Add specific paths

You can control which files are committed with the `add-paths` input.
Paths should follow git\'s [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax.
File changes that do not match one of the paths will be stashed and restored after the action has completed.

```yml
```

#### Create your own commits

As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.
Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won\'t work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).

```yml
```

### Create a project card

To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.

```yml
```

### Auto-merge

Auto-merge can be enabled on a pull request allowing it to be automatically merged once requirements have been satisfied.
See [enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) action for usage details.

## Reference Example

The following workflow sets many of the action\'s inputs for reference purposes.
Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.

```yml
```

An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:

See the [v2 README.md](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/v2/README.md) for older updates.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repository\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-cache-workflow) is available below. For more information, see the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

If you are using this inside a container, a POSIX-compliant `tar` needs to be included and accessible from the execution path.

If you are using a `self-hosted` Windows runner, `GNU tar` and `zstd` are required for [Cross-OS caching](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) to work. They are also recommended to be installed in general so the performance is on par with `hosted` Windows runners.

### Inputs

* `key` - An explicit key for a cache entry. See [creating a cache key](#creating-a-cache-key).
* `path` - A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore. See [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns.
* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of prefix-matched keys to use for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key.
* `enableCrossOsArchive` - An optional boolean when enabled, allows Windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms. Default: `false`
* `fail-on-cache-miss` - Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found. Default: `false`
* `lookup-only` - If true, only checks if cache entry exists and skips download. Does not change save cache behavior. Default: `false`

#### Environment Variables

* `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS` - Segment download timeout (in minutes, default `10`) to abort download of the segment if not completed in the defined number of minutes. [Read more](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)

### Outputs

* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key.

    > **Note** `cache-hit` will only be set to `true` when a cache hit occurs for the exact `key` match. For a partial key match via `restore-keys` or a cache miss, it will be set to `false`.

See [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output

### Cache scopes

The cache is scoped to the key, [version](#cache-version), and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches.

See [Matching a cache key](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key) for more info.

### Example cache workflow

#### Restoring and saving cache using a single action

```yaml
```

The `cache` action provides a `cache-hit` output which is set to `true` when the cache is restored using the primary `key` and `false` when the cache is restored using `restore-keys` or no cache is restored.

#### Using a combination of restore and save actions

```yaml
```

> **Note**
> You must use the `cache` or `restore` action in your workflow before you need to use the files that might be restored from the cache. If the provided `key` matches an existing cache, a new cache is not created and if the provided `key` doesn\'t match an existing cache, a new cache is automatically created provided the job completes successfully.

## Caching Strategies

With the introduction of the `restore` and `save` actions, a lot of caching use cases can now be achieved. Please see the [caching strategies](./caching-strategies.md) document for understanding how you can use the actions strategically to achieve the desired goal.

## Implementation Examples

Every programming language and framework has its own way of caching.

See [Examples](examples.md) for a list of `actions/cache` implementations for use with:

* [C# - NuGet](./examples.md#c---nuget)
* [Clojure - Lein Deps](./examples.md#clojure---lein-deps)

* [Swift - Mint](./examples.md#swift---mint)

## Creating a cache key

A cache key can include any of the contexts, functions, literals, and operators supported by GitHub Actions.

For example, using the [`hashFiles`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#hashfiles) function allows you to create a new cache when dependencies change.

```yaml
```

Additionally, you can use arbitrary command output in a cache key, such as a date or software version:

```yaml
```

See [Using contexts to create cache keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#using-contexts-to-create-cache-keys)

## Cache Limits

A repository can have up to 10GB of caches. Once the 10GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.

## Skipping steps based on cache-hit

Using the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.  It is recommended to install missing/updated dependencies in case of a partial key match when the key is dependent on the `hash` of the package file.

Example:

```yaml
```

> **Note** The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)

## Cache Version

Cache version is a hash [generated](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/500d0b42fee2552ae9eeb5933091fe2fbf14e72d/packages/cache/src/internal/cacheHttpClient.ts#L73-L90) for a combination of compression tool used (Gzip, Zstd, etc. based on the runner OS) and the `path` of directories being cached. If two caches have different versions, they are identified as unique caches while matching. This, for example, means that a cache created on a `windows-latest` runner can\'t be restored on `ubuntu-latest` as cache `Version`s are different.

> Pro tip: The [list caches](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache#list-github-actions-caches-for-a-repository) API can be used to get the version of a cache. This can be helpful to troubleshoot cache miss due to version.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
The workflow will create 3 unique caches with same keys. Ubuntu and windows runners will use different compression technique and hence create two different caches. And `build-linux` will create two different caches as the `paths` are different.

```yaml
```

</details>

## Known practices and workarounds

There are a number of community practices/workarounds to fulfill specific requirements. You may choose to use them if they suit your use case. Note these are not necessarily the only solution or even a recommended solution.

* [Cache segment restore timeout](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)
* [Update a cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#update-a-cache)
* [Use cache across feature branches](./tips-and-workarounds.md#use-cache-across-feature-branches)
* [Cross OS cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache)
* [Force deletion of caches overriding default cache eviction policy](./tips-and-workarounds.md#force-deletion-of-caches-overriding-default-cache-eviction-policy)

### Windows environment variables

Please note that Windows environment variables (like `%LocalAppData%`) will NOT be expanded by this action. Instead, prefer using `~` in your paths which will expand to the HOME directory. For example, instead of `%LocalAppData%`, use `~\\AppData\\Local`. For a list of supported default environment variables, see the [Learn GitHub Actions: Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) page.

### Easily upload coverage reports to Codecov from GitHub Actions

>The latest release of this Action adds support for tokenless uploads from GitHub Actions!

## \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f  Deprecation of v1
**As of February 1, 2022, v1 has been fully sunset and no longer functions**

Due to the [deprecation](https://about.codecov.io/blog/introducing-codecovs-new-uploader/) of the underlying bash uploader,
the Codecov GitHub Action has released `v2`/`v3` which will use the new [uploader](https://github.com/codecov/uploader). You can learn
more about our deprecation plan and the new uploader on our [blog](https://about.codecov.io/blog/introducing-codecovs-new-uploader/).

We will be restricting any updates to the `v1` Action to security updates and hotfixes.

### Migration from `v1` to `v3`
The `v3` uploader has a few breaking changes for users
- Multiple fields have not been transferred from the bash uploader or have been deprecated. Notably
many of the `functionalities` and `gcov_` arguments have been removed. Please check the documentation
below for the full list.

## Usage

To integrate Codecov with your Actions pipeline, specify the name of this repository with a tag number (`@v3` is recommended) as a `step` within your `workflow.yml` file.

If you have a *private repository*, this Action also requires you to [provide an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) from [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io) (tip: in order to avoid exposing your token, store it as a `secret`). Optionally, you can choose to include up to four additional inputs to customize the upload context. **For public repositories, no token is needed**

Inside your `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` file:

```yaml
```
>**Note**: This assumes that you've set your Codecov token inside *Settings > Secrets* as `CODECOV_TOKEN`. If not, you can [get an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) for your specific repo on [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io). Keep in mind that secrets are *not* available to forks of repositories.

> Deploy your plugin to the WordPress.org repository using GitHub Actions.

[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/blob/develop/LICENSE) [![Automated Tests](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This Action commits the contents of your Git tag to the WordPress.org plugin repository using the same tag name. It can exclude files as defined in either `.distignore` or `.gitattributes`, and moves anything from a `.wordpress-org` subdirectory to the top-level `assets` directory in Subversion (plugin banners, icons, and screenshots).

### \xe2\x98\x9e For updating the readme and items in the assets directory between releases, please see our [WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update)

### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)

## Configuration

### Required secrets

* `SVN_USERNAME`
* `SVN_PASSWORD`

[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.

### Optional environment variables

* `SLUG` - Defaults to the repository name. This is customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.
* `VERSION` - Defaults to the tag name.  We do not recommend setting this except for testing purposes.
* `ASSETS_DIR` - Defaults to `.wordpress-org`. This is customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`).
* `BUILD_DIR` - Defaults to `false`. Set this flag to the directory where you build your plugins files into, then the action will copy and deploy files from that directory. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. The relative path if provided will be concatenated with the repository root directory. All files and folders in the build directory will be deployed, `.disignore` or `.gitattributes` will be ignored.

### Inputs

* `generate-zip` - Defaults to `false`. Generate a ZIP file from the SVN `trunk` directory. Outputs a `zip-path` variable for use in further workflow steps.
* `dry-run` - Defaults to `false`. Set this to `true` if you want to skip the final Subversion commit step (e.g., to debug prior to a non-dry-run commit).

### Outputs

* `zip-path` - The path to the ZIP file generated if `generate-zip` is set to `true`. Fully qualified including the filename, intended for use in further workflow steps such as uploading release assets.

## Excluding files from deployment

If there are files or directories to be excluded from deployment, such as tests or editor config files, they can be specified in either a `.distignore` file or a `.gitattributes` file using the `export-ignore` directive. If a `.distignore` file is present, it will be used; if not, the Action will look for a `.gitattributes` file and barring that, will write a basic temporary `.gitattributes` into place before proceeding so that no Git/GitHub-specific files are included.

`.distignore` is useful particularly when there are built files that are in `.gitignore`, and is a file that is used in [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/). For modern plugin setups with a build step and no built files committed to the repository, this is the way forward. `.gitattributes` is useful for plugins that don\'t run a build step as a part of the Actions workflow and also allows for GitHub\'s generated ZIP files to contain the same contents as what is committed to WordPress.org. If you would like to attach a ZIP file with the proper contents that decompresses to a folder name without version number as WordPress generally expects, you can add steps to your workflow that generate the ZIP and attach it to the GitHub release (concrete examples to come).

### Sample baseline files

#### `.distignore`

**Notes:** `.distignore` is for files to be ignored **only**; it does not currently allow negation like `.gitignore`. This comes from its current expected syntax in WP-CLI\'s [`wp dist-archive` command](https://github.com/wp-cli/dist-archive-command/). It is possible that this Action will allow for includes via something like a `.distinclude` file in the future, or that WP-CLI itself makes a change that this Action will reflect for consistency. It also will need to contain more than `.gitattributes` because that method **also** respects `.gitignore`.

```
```

#### `.gitattributes`

```gitattributes
```

## Example Workflow Files

To get started, you will want to copy the contents of one of these examples into `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and push that to your repository. You are welcome to name the file something else, but it must be in that directory. The usage of `ubuntu-latest` is recommended for compatibility with required dependencies in this Action.

11,"# WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update

> Deploy readme and asset updates to the WordPress Plugin Repository.

[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/LICENSE)

This Action commits any readme and WordPress.org-specific assets changes in your specified branch to the WordPress.org plugin repository if no other changes have been made since the last deployment to WordPress.org. This is useful for updating things like screenshots or `Tested up to` separately from functional changes, provided your Git branching methodology avoids changing anything else in the specified branch between functional releases. It is **highly recommended** that you use a stable branch where you only merge readme/asset commits in between larger functional merges that only occur when preparing for a release (often implemented as `trunk` vs. `develop`).

Because the WordPress.org plugin repository shows information from the readme in the specified `Stable tag`, this Action also attempts to parse out the stable tag from your readme and deploy to there as well as `trunk`. If your stable tag is `trunk` or a tag that does not exist in the `tags` subfolder, it will skip that part of the update and only update `trunk` and/or `assets`.

**Important note:** If your development process leads to a situation where `trunk` (or other specified branch) only contains changes to the readme or assets directory since the last sync to the plugin directory and those changes are in preparation for the next release, those changes will go live and potentially be misleading to users. Usage of this Action assumes a fairly traditional Git methodology that involves merging all changes to `trunk` when functional changes are ready and that this seemingly unlikely situation will therefore not happen in your repo; there are no safeguards against syncing changes based on readme/asset content, as that cannot be predicted.

### \xe2\x98\x9e This Action is meant to be used in tandem with our [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy)

### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)

## Configuration

### Required secrets

* `SVN_USERNAME`
* `SVN_PASSWORD`

[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.

### Optional environment variables

* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.
* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`). And if you ever want not to update assets and you don\'t have any assets directory, use `SKIP_ASSETS : true`
* `README_NAME` - defaults to `readme.txt`, customizable in case you use `README.md` instead, which is now quietly supported in the WordPress.org plugin repository.
* `IGNORE_OTHER_FILES` - defaults to `false`, which means that all your files are copied (as in [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy), respecting `.distignore` and `.gitattributes`), and the Action will bail if anything except assets and `readme.txt` are modified. See ""Important note"" above. If you set this variable to `true`, then only assets and `readme.txt` will be copied, and changes to other files will be ignored and not committed.

## Example Git Workflow

For this example, Git\'s `main` branch (the default on new repositories) corresponds directly to Subversion\'s `trunk` and is considered the ""release"" branch.

In general, the expected workflow when using the [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy) is as follows:

1. Create a new branch for feature x
2. When the feature is ready for release, merge it onto `main`
3. On `main`, update the `readme.txt` to reflect the change, e.g.: set the ""Stable tag"", update the changelog, etc. (although some of this could be done on the feature branch prior to merging)
4. Update any assets in `.wordpress-org`
5. Tag `main` with the new version number, e.g.: `1.1.0`

At this point, the [deploy action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy) will push the tag as a Subversion branch to the WordPress svn repository and your new version will be live.

And this is where _this_ action comes in\xe2\x80\xa6

As `main` is our ""release"" branch, changes to anything other than the `readme.txt` and `.wordpress-org` can only be made live by tagging `main`.

If, however, you need to update the `readme.txt` or assets folder (`.wordpress-org`) for any reason, you should do that directly on `main` and then push your changes. This action will verify that only the `readme.txt` and `.wordpress-org` contain changes and if so, will push them directly to `trunk` on the WordPress svn repository.

## Example Workflow File

```yml
```

### Known issues

* It would be more efficient to additionally use the `paths` filter for the `push` action to reduce the number of runs. So far in testing it is possible to limit it to pushes that include readme/asset files as specified, but not ones that *only* include those files. The Action itself still needs to run as written because it compares the totality of changes in the branch against what\'s in SVN and not just the contents of the current push.

12,"# Setup Java

[![Basic validation](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml)
[![Validate Java e2e](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-versions.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-versions.yml)
[![Validate cache](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-cache.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-cache.yml)

The `setup-java` action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions runners:
- Downloading and setting up a requested version of Java. See [Usage](#Usage) for a list of supported distributions.
- Extracting and caching custom version of Java from a local file.
- Configuring runner for publishing using Apache Maven.
- Configuring runner for publishing using Gradle.
- Configuring runner for using GPG private key.
- Registering problem matchers for error output.
- Caching dependencies managed by Apache Maven.
- Caching dependencies managed by Gradle.
- Caching dependencies managed by sbt.
- [Maven Toolchains declaration](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) for specified JDK versions.

This action allows you to work with Java and Scala projects.

## V2 vs V1

- V2 supports custom distributions and provides support for Azul Zulu OpenJDK, Eclipse Temurin and AdoptOpenJDK  out of the box. V1 supports only Azul Zulu OpenJDK.
- V2 requires you to specify distribution along with the version. V1 defaults to Azul Zulu OpenJDK, only version input is required. Follow [the migration guide](docs/switching-to-v2.md) to switch from V1 to V2.

## Usage

  - `java-version`: The Java version that is going to be set up. Takes a whole or [semver](#supported-version-syntax) Java version. If not specified, the action will expect `java-version-file` input to be specified.

  - `java-version-file`: The path to the `.java-version` file. See more details in [about `.java-version` file](docs/advanced-usage.md#Java-version-file).
   
  - `distribution`: _(required)_ Java [distribution](#supported-distributions).

  - `java-package`: The packaging variant of the chosen distribution. Possible values: `jdk`, `jre`, `jdk+fx`, `jre+fx`. Default value: `jdk`.

  - `architecture`: The target architecture of the package. Possible values: `x86`, `x64`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `ppc64le`. Default value: Derived from the runner machine.

  - `jdkFile`: If a use-case requires a custom distribution setup-java uses the compressed JDK from the location pointed by this input and will take care of the installation and caching on the VM.

  - `check-latest`: Setting this option makes the action to check for the latest available version for the version spec.

  - `cache`: Quick [setup caching](#caching-packages-dependencies) for the dependencies managed through one of the predefined package managers. It can be one of ""maven"", ""gradle"" or ""sbt"".

  #### Maven options
  The action has a bunch of inputs to generate maven\'s [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) on the fly and pass the values to Apache Maven GPG Plugin as well as Apache Maven Toolchains. See [advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) for more.

  - `overwrite-settings`: By default action overwrites the settings.xml. In order to skip generation of file if it exists, set this to `false`.

  - `server-id`: ID of the distributionManagement repository in the pom.xml file. Default is `github`.

  - `server-username`: Environment variable name for the username for authentication to the Apache Maven repository. Default is GITHUB_ACTOR.

  - `server-password`: Environment variable name for password or token for authentication to the Apache Maven repository. Default is GITHUB_TOKEN.

  - `settings-path`: Maven related setting to point to the directory where the settings.xml file will be written. Default is ~/.m2.

  - `gpg-private-key`: GPG private key to import. Default is empty string.

  - `gpg-passphrase`: Environment variable name for the GPG private key passphrase. Default is GPG_PASSPHRASE.

  - `mvn-toolchain-id`: Name of Maven Toolchain ID if the default name of `${distribution}_${java-version}` is not wanted.

  - `mvn-toolchain-vendor`: Name of Maven Toolchain Vendor if the default name of `${distribution}` is not wanted.

### Basic Configuration

#### Eclipse Temurin
```yaml
```

#### Azul Zulu OpenJDK
```yaml
```

#### Supported version syntax
The `java-version` input supports an exact version or a version range using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) notation:
- major versions: `8`, `11`, `16`, `17`
- more specific versions: `17.0`, `11.0`, `11.0.4`, `8.0.232`, `8.0.282+8`
- early access (EA) versions: `15-ea`, `15.0.0-ea`, `15.0.0-ea.2`, `15.0.0+2-ea`

#### Supported distributions
Currently, the following distributions are supported:
| Keyword | Distribution | Official site | License
|-|-|-|-|
| `temurin` | Eclipse Temurin | [Link](https://adoptium.net/) | [Link](https://adoptium.net/about.html)
| `zulu` | Azul Zulu OpenJDK | [Link](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk) | [Link](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-and-zulu-enterprise/zulu-terms-of-use/) |
| `adopt` or `adopt-hotspot` | AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/about.html) |
| `adopt-openj9` | AdoptOpenJDK OpenJ9 | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/about.html) |
| `liberica` | Liberica JDK | [Link](https://bell-sw.com/) | [Link](https://bell-sw.com/liberica_eula/) |
| `microsoft` | Microsoft Build of OpenJDK | [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) | [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/faq)
| `corretto` | Amazon Corretto Build of OpenJDK | [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) | [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/faqs/)
| `semeru` | IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition | [Link](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/) | [Link](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html) |
| `oracle` | Oracle JDK | [Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) | [Link](https://java.com/freeuselicense)

**NOTE:** The different distributors can provide discrepant list of available versions / supported configurations. Please refer to the official documentation to see the list of supported versions.

**NOTE:** AdoptOpenJDK got moved to Eclipse Temurin and won\'t be updated anymore. It is highly recommended to migrate workflows from `adopt` and `adopt-openj9`, to `temurin` and `semeru` respectively, to keep receiving software and security updates. See more details in the [Good-bye AdoptOpenJDK post](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/08/goodbye-adoptopenjdk-hello-adoptium/).

**NOTE:** For Azul Zulu OpenJDK architectures x64 and arm64 are mapped to x86 / arm with proper hw_bitness.

### Caching packages dependencies
The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under hood for caching dependencies but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are gradle, maven and sbt. The format of the used cache key is `setup-java-${{ platform }}-${{ packageManager }}-${{ fileHash }}`, where the hash is based on the following files:
- gradle: `**/*.gradle*`, `**/gradle-wrapper.properties`, `buildSrc/**/Versions.kt`, `buildSrc/**/Dependencies.kt`, `gradle/*.versions.toml`, and `**/versions.properties`
- maven: `**/pom.xml`
- sbt: all sbt build definition files `**/*.sbt`, `**/project/build.properties`, `**/project/**.scala`, `**/project/**.sbt`

The workflow output `cache-hit` is set to indicate if an exact match was found for the key [as actions/cache does](https://github.com/actions/cache/tree/main#outputs).

The cache input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.

#### Caching gradle dependencies
```yaml
```

#### Caching maven dependencies
```yaml
```

#### Caching sbt dependencies
```yaml
```

### Check latest

In the basic examples above, the `check-latest` flag defaults to `false`. When set to `false`, the action tries to first resolve a version of Java from the local tool cache on the runner. If unable to find a specific version in the cache, the action will download a version of Java. Use the default or set `check-latest` to `false` if you prefer a faster more consistent setup experience that prioritizes trying to use the cached versions at the expense of newer versions sometimes being available for download.

If `check-latest` is set to `true`, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally cached version is not the most up-to-date, the latest version of Java will be downloaded. Set `check-latest` to `true` if you want the most up-to-date version of Java to always be used. Setting `check-latest` to `true` has performance implications as downloading versions of Java is slower than using cached versions.

For Java distributions that are not cached on Hosted images, `check-latest` always behaves as `true` and downloads Java on-flight. Check out [Hosted Tool Cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#Hosted-Tool-Cache) for more details about pre-cached Java versions.


```yaml
```

### Testing against different Java versions
```yaml
```

### Install multiple JDKs

All versions are added to the PATH. The last version will be used and available globally. Other Java versions can be accessed through env variables with such specification as \'JAVA_HOME_{{ MAJOR_VERSION }}_{{ ARCHITECTURE }}\'.

```yaml
```

### Using Maven Toolchains
In the example above multiple JDKs are installed for the same job. The result after the last JDK is installed is a Maven Toolchains declaration containing references to all three JDKs. The values for `id`, `version`, and `vendor` of the individual Toolchain entries are the given input values for `distribution` and `java-version` (`vendor` being the combination of `${distribution}_${java-version}`) by default.

13,"# Execute Gradle builds in GitHub Actions workflows

This GitHub Action can be used to configure Gradle and optionally execute a Gradle build on any platform supported by GitHub Actions.

## Use the action to setup Gradle

If you have an existing workflow invoking Gradle, you can add an initial ""Setup Gradle"" Step to benefit from caching, 
build-scan capture and other features of the gradle-build-action.

All subsequent Gradle invocations will benefit from this initial setup, via `init` scripts added to the Gradle User Home.

```yaml
```

## Why use the `gradle-build-action`?

It is possible to directly invoke Gradle in your workflow, and the `actions/setup-java@v3` action provides a simple way to cache Gradle dependencies. 

However, the `gradle-build-action` offers a number of advantages over this approach:

- Easily [run the build with different versions of Gradle](#use-a-specific-gradle-version) using the `gradle-version` parameter. Gradle distributions are automatically downloaded and cached. 
- More sophisticated and more efficient caching of Gradle User Home between invocations, compared to `setup-java` and most custom configurations using `actions/cache`. [More details below](#caching).
- Detailed reporting of cache usage and cache configuration options allow you to [optimize the use of the GitHub actions cache](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).
- [Automatic capture of Build Scan\xc2\xae links](#build-scans) from the build, making these easier to locate for workflow run.

The `gradle-build-action` is designed to provide these benefits with minimal configuration. 
These features work both when Gradle is executed via the `gradle-build-action` and for any Gradle execution in subsequent steps.

When using `gradle-build-action` we recommend that you _not_ use `actions/cache` or `actions/setup-java@v3` to explicitly cache the Gradle User Home. Doing so may interfere with the caching provided by this action.

## Use a specific Gradle version

The `gradle-build-action` can download and install a specified Gradle version, adding this installed version to the PATH.
Downloaded Gradle versions are stored in the GitHub Actions cache, to avoid requiring downloading again later.

```yaml
```

The `gradle-version` parameter can be set to any valid Gradle version.

Moreover, you can use the following aliases:

| Alias | Selects |
| --- |---|
| `wrapper`           | The Gradle wrapper\'s version (default, useful for matrix builds) |
| `current`           | The current [stable release](https://gradle.org/install/) |
| `release-candidate` | The current [release candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate/) if any, otherwise fallback to `current` |
| `nightly`           | The latest [nightly](https://gradle.org/nightly/), fails if none. |
| `release-nightly`   | The latest [release nightly](https://gradle.org/release-nightly/), fails if none.      |

This can be handy to automatically verify your build works with the latest release candidate of Gradle:

```yaml
```

## Gradle Execution

If the action is configured with an `arguments` input, then Gradle will execute a Gradle build with the arguments provided.

If no `arguments` are provided, the action will not execute Gradle, but will still cache Gradle state and configure build-scan capture for all subsequent Gradle executions.

```yaml
```

### Multiple Gradle executions in the same Job

It is possible to configure multiple Gradle executions to run sequentially in the same job. 
The initial Action step will perform the Gradle setup.

```yaml
```

### Gradle command-line arguments

The `arguments` input can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to the `gradle` command line.
Arguments can be supplied in a single line, or as a multi-line input.

Here are some valid examples:
```yaml
```

If you need to pass environment variables, use the GitHub Actions workflow syntax:

```yaml
```

### Gradle build located in a subdirectory

By default, the action will execute Gradle in the root directory of your project. 
Use the `build-root-directory` input to target a Gradle build in a subdirectory.

```yaml
```

### Using a specific Gradle executable

The action will first look for a Gradle wrapper script in the root directory of your project. 
If not found, `gradle` will be executed from the PATH.
Use the `gradle-executable` input to execute using a specific Gradle installation.

```yaml
```

This mechanism can also be used to target a Gradle wrapper script that is located in a non-default location.

## Caching

By default, this action aims to cache any and all reusable state that may be speed up a subsequent build invocation. 

The state that is cached includes:
- Any distributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter ;
- A subset of the Gradle User Home directory, including downloaded dependencies, wrapper distributions, and the local build cache ;

To reduce the space required for caching, this action makes a best effort to reduce duplication in cache entries.

Caching is enabled by default. You can disable caching for the action as follows:
```yaml
```
### Cache keys

Distributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter are stored outside of Gradle User Home and cached separately. The cache key is unique to the downloaded distribution and will not change over time.

The state of the Gradle User Home is highly dependent on the Gradle execution, so the cache key is composed of the current commit hash and the GitHub actions job id.
As such, the cache key is likely to change on each subsequent run of GitHub actions. 
This allows the most recent state to always be available in the GitHub actions cache.

To reduce duplication between cache entries, certain artifacts are cached independently based on their identity.
Artifacts that are cached independently include downloaded dependencies, downloaded wrapper distributions and generated Gradle API jars.
For example, this means that all jobs executing a particular version of the Gradle wrapper will share common entries for wrapper distributions and for generated Gradle API jars.

### Using the caches read-only

By default, the `gradle-build-action` will only write to the cache from Jobs on the default (`main`/`master`) branch.
Jobs on other branches will read entries from the cache but will not write updated entries. 
See [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness) for a more detailed explanation.

In some circumstances it makes sense to change this default, and to configure a workflow Job to read existing cache entries but not to write changes back.

You can configure read-only caching for the `gradle-build-action` as follows:

```yaml
```

### Stopping the Gradle daemon

By default, the action will stop all running Gradle daemons in the post-action step, prior to saving the Gradle User Home state. 
This allows for any Gradle User Home cleanup to occur, and avoid file-locking issues on Windows.

If caching is unavailable or the cache is in read-only mode, the daemon will not be stopped and will continue running after the job is completed.

### Gradle User Home cache tuning

As well as any wrapper distributions, the action will attempt to save and restore the `caches` and `notifications` directories from Gradle User Home.

The contents to be cached can be fine tuned by including and excluding certain paths with Gradle User Home.

```yaml
```

You can specify any number of fixed paths or patterns to include or exclude. 
File pattern support is documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#patterns-to-match-file-paths.

### Cache debugging and analysis

Gradle User Home state will be restored from the cache during the first `gradle-build-action` step for any workflow job. 
This state will be saved back to the cache at the end of the job, after all Gradle executions have completed.
A report of all cache entries restored and saved is printed to the Job Summary when saving the cache entries. 
This report can provide valuable insignt into how much cache space is being used.

It is possible to enable additional debug logging for cache operations. You do via the `GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable:

```yaml
```

Note that this setting will also prevent certain cache operations from running in parallel, further assisting with debugging.

### Optimizing cache effectiveness

Cache storage space for GitHub actions is limited, and writing new cache entries can trigger the deletion of existing entries.
Eviction of shared cache entries can reduce cache effectiveness, slowing down your `gradle-build-action` steps.

There are a number of actions you can take if your cache use is less effective due to entry eviction.

#### Select branches that should write to the cache

GitHub cache entries are not shared between builds on different branches. 
This means that each PR branch will have it\'s own Gradle User Home cache, and will not benefit from cache entries written by other PR branches.
An exception to this is that cache entries written in parent and upstream branches are visible to child branches, and cache entries for the default (`master`/`main`) branch can be read by actions invoked for any other branch.

By default, the `gradle-build-action` will only _write_ to the cache for builds run on the default (`master`/`main`) branch. 
Jobs run on other branches will only read from the cache. In most cases, this is the desired behaviour, 
because Jobs run against other branches will benefit from the cache Gradle User Home from `main`, 
without writing private cache entries that could lead to evicting shared entries.

If you have other long-lived development branches that would benefit from writing to the cache, 
you can configure these by overriding the `cache-read-only` action parameter. 
See [Using the caches read-only](#using-the-caches-read-only) for more details.

Similarly, you could use `cache-read-only` for certain jobs in the workflow, and instead have these jobs reuse the cache content from upstream jobs.

#### Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache

Each build is different, and some builds produce more Gradle User Home content than others.
[Cache debugging ](#cache-debugging-and-analysis) can provide insight into which cache entries are the largest,
and you can selectively [exclude content using `gradle-home-cache-exclude`](#gradle-user-home-cache-tuning).

#### Removing unused files from Gradle User Home before saving to cache

The Gradle User Home directory has a tendency to grow over time. When you switch to a new Gradle wrapper version or upgrade a dependency version
the old files are not automatically and immediately removed. While this can make sense in a local environment, in a GitHub Actions environment
it can lead to ever-larger Gradle User Home cache entries being saved and restored.

In order to avoid this situation, the `gradle-build-action` supports the `gradle-home-cache-cleanup` parameter. 
When enabled, this feature will attempt to delete any files in the Gradle User Home that were not used by Gradle during the GitHub Actions workflow, 
prior to saving the Gradle User Home to the GitHub Actions cache.

Gradle Home cache cleanup is disabled by default.  You can enable this feature for the action as follows:
```yaml
```

## Build reporting

The `gradle-build-action` collects information about any Gradle executions that occur in a workflow, and reports these via
a Job Summary, visible in the GitHub Actions UI. For each Gradle execution, details about the invocation are listed, together with
a link to any Build Scan\xc2\xae published.

Generation of a Job Summary is enabled by default. If this is not desired, it can be disable as follows:
```yaml
```

Note that the action collects information about Gradle invocations via an [Initialization Script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html#sec:using_an_init_script)
located at `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/build-result-capture.init.gradle`.
If you are using init scripts for the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise) like
[`scans-init.gradle` or `gradle-enterprise-init.gradle`](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#scans_gradle_com),
you\'ll need to ensure these files are applied prior to `build-result-capture.init.gradle`.
Since Gradle applies init scripts in alphabetical order, one way to ensure this is via file naming.

### Build Scan\xc2\xae link as Step output

As well as reporting the [Build Scan](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) link in the Job Summary,
the `gradle-build-action` action makes this link available as a Step output named `build-scan-url`.

You can then use that link in subsequent actions of your workflow. For example:

```yaml
```

### Saving build outputs

By default, a GitHub Actions workflow using `gradle-build-action` will record the log output and any Build Scan links for your build,
but any output files generated by the build will not be saved.

To save selected files from your build execution, you can use the core [Upload-Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.
For example:

```yaml
```

## Support for GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

You can use the `gradle-build-action` on GitHub Enterprise Server, and benefit from the improved integration with Gradle. Depending on the version of GHES you are running, certain features may be limited:
- Build Scan links are captured and displayed in the GitHub Actions UI
- Easily run your build with different versions of Gradle
- Save/restore of Gradle User Home (requires GHES v3.5+ : GitHub Actions cache was introduced in GHES 3.5)
- Support for GitHub Actions Job Summary (requires GHES 3.6+ : GitHub Actions Job Summary support was introduced in GHES 3.6). In earlier versions of GHES the build-results summary and caching report will be written to the workflow log, as part of the post-action step.

# GitHub Dependency Graph support

The `gradle-build-action` has experimental support for submitting a [GitHub Dependency Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph) snapshot via the [GitHub Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

The dependency graph snapshot is generated via integration with the [GitHub Dependency Graph Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin), and saved as a workflow artifact. The generated snapshot files can be submitted either in the same job, or in a subsequent job (in the same or a dependent workflow).

The generated dependency graph snapshot reports all of the dependencies that were resolved during a bulid execution, and is used by GitHub to generate [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) for vulnerable dependencies, as well as to populate the [Dependency Graph insights view](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph).
 
You enable GitHub Dependency Graph support by setting the `dependency-graph` action parameter. Valid values are:

|<div style=""width:290px"">Option</div> | Behaviour |
| --- |---|
| `disabled`           | Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations.<p>This is the default. |
| `generate`           | Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact. |
| `generate-and-submit` | As per `generate`, but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job. |
| `download-and-submit` | Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step. |

- \'disabled\': Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations. This is the default.
- \'generate\': Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact.
- \'generate-and-submit\': As per \'generate\', but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job.
- \'download-and-submit\': Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step.

Dependency Graph _submission_ (but not generation) requires the `contents: write` permission, which may need to be explicitly enabled in the workflow file.

Example of a simple workflow that generates and submits a dependency graph:
```yaml
```

### Filtering which Gradle Configurations contribute to the dependency graph

If you do not want to include every dependency configuration in every project in your build, you can limit the
dependency extraction to a subset of these.

To restrict which Gradle subprojects contribute to the report, specify which projects to include via a regular expression.
You can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_PROJECTS` environment variable or system property.

To restrict which Gradle configurations contribute to the report, you can filter configurations by name using a regular expression.
You can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS` environment variable or system property.

Example of a simple workflow that limits the dependency graph to `RuntimeClasspath` configuration:
```yaml
```

### Gradle version compatibility

The plugin should be compatible with all versions of Gradle >= 5.0, and has been tested against 
Gradle versions ""5.6.4"", ""6.9.4"", ""7.0.2"", ""7.6.2"", ""8.0.2"" and the current Gradle release.

The plugin is compatible with running Gradle with the configuration-cache enabled. However, this support is
limited to Gradle ""8.1.0"" and later:
- With Gradle ""8.0"", the build should run successfully, but an empty dependency graph will be generated.
- With Gradle <= ""7.6.4"", the plugin will cause the build to fail with configuration-cache enabled.

To use this plugin with versions of Gradle older than ""8.1.0"", you\'ll need to invoke Gradle with the
configuration-cache disabled.

### Dependency snapshots generated for pull requests

This `contents: write` permission is not available for any workflow that is triggered by a pull request submitted from a forked repository, since it would permit a malicious pull request to make repository changes. 

Because of this restriction, it is not possible to `generate-and-submit` a dependency graph generated for a pull-request that comes from a repository fork. In order to do so, 2 workflows will be required:
1. The first workflow runs directly against the pull request sources and will generate the dependency graph snapshot.
2. The second workflow is triggered on `workflow_run` of the first workflow, and will submit the previously saved dependency snapshots.

Note: when `download-and-submit` is used in a workflow triggered via [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run), the action will download snapshots saved in the triggering workflow.

***Main workflow file***

14,"# microsoft/setup-msbuild\r
This action will help discover where the `MSBuild` tool is and automatically add it to the `PATH` environment variables for you so future steps in your Actions workflow can just initiate `msbuild` commands without knowing the full path.\r
\r
> Please note this tool does NOT add other Visual Studio tools (like VSTest, cl, cmake, or others) to `PATH`\r
\r
## Example Usage\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
## Optional Parameters\r
There are a few additional parameters that can be set if you need them. These are optional and should only be set if you know that you need them or what you are doing.\r
\r
### Specifying specific versions of Visual Studio (optional)\r
You may have a situation where your Actions runner has multiple versions of Visual Studio and you need to find a specific version of the tool.  Simply add the `vs-version` input to specify the range of versions to find.  If looking for a specific version, specify the minimum and maximum versions as shown in the example below, which will look for just 16.4.\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
The syntax is the same used for Visual Studio extensions, where square brackets like ""["" mean inclusive, and parenthesis like ""("" mean exclusive. A comma is always required, but eliding the minimum version looks for all older versions and eliding the maximum version looks for all newer versions. See the [vswhere wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere/wiki) for more details.\r
\r
### Use pre-release versions of Visual Studio (optional)\r
If you need your Actions runner to target a pre-release version of Visual Studio, simply add the `vs-prerelease` input.  This is necessary if you want to run an action on a virtual environment that contains a pre-release version of Visual Studio or self-hosted images that you may have that also have pre-release versions of Visual Studio installed.\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
### Specifying MSBuild architecture (optional)\r
By default the action will use the x86 architecture for MSBuild, but it is possible to target the x64 versions instead. Simply add the `msbuild-architecture` input. Valid input values are `x86` (default), `x64`, and `arm64`. Note that the success of these will rely on the runner OS.\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
## How does this work?\r
This makes use of the vswhere tool which is a tool delivered by Microsoft to help in identifying Visual Studio installs and various components.  This tool is installed on the hosted Windows runners for GitHub Actions.  If you are using a self-hosted runner, you either need to make sure vswhere.exe is in your agent\'s PATH or specify a full path to the location using:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
## Notes on arguments\r
While the Action enables you to specify a `vswhere` path as well as a `vs-version`, these are more advanced options and when using GitHub-hosted runners you should not need these and is recommended you don\'t specify them as they are optional.  Using these require you to fully understand the runner environment, updates to the tools on the runner, and can cause failures if you are out of sync.  For GitHub-hosted runners, omitting these arguments is the preferred usage.\r
\r
## Building this repo\r
As with most GitHub Actions, this requires NodeJS development tools.  After installing NodeJS, you can build this by executing:\r
\r
```bash\r
```\r
\r
which will modify/create the /dist folder with the final index.js output\r

16,"# setup-ruby

This action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.

It is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.
No extra packages need to be installed.

**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.
If you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit
will be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).

`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  

Regarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64
builds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.

Preview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).
However, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,
as it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.

Only release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)
are available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10
on other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.

Note that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,
which means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.

### Supported Platforms

The action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.

| Operating System | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |
| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |
| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |

The prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)
and on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).
The `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).
`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),
`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),
`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)
and `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).
The full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)
for Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.

## Usage

### Single Job

```yaml
```

### Matrix of Ruby Versions

This matrix tests all stable releases and `head` versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby on Ubuntu and macOS.

```yaml
```

### Matrix of Gemfiles

```yaml
```

See the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the
[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
and the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Supported Version Syntax

* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`
* short version like `\'2.6\'`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.10`)
* version only like `\'2.6.5\'`, assumes MRI for the engine
* engine only like `ruby` and `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation
* `.ruby-version` reads from the project\'s `.ruby-version` file
* `.tool-versions` reads from the project\'s `.tool-versions` file
* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`

### Working Directory

The `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`
if they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.

### RubyGems

By default, the default RubyGems version that comes with each Ruby is used.
However, users can optionally customize the RubyGems version that they want by
setting the `rubygems` input.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `rubygems` input.

If you\'re running into `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 4,
expected 1)` errors with a stacktrace including Psych and RubyGems entries, you
should be able to fix them by setting `rubygems: 3.0.0` or higher.

### Bundler

By default, Bundler is installed as follows:

* If there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,
  that version of Bundler will be installed and used.
* If the Ruby ships with Bundler 2.2+ (as a default gem), that version is used.
* Otherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.3, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.3).

This behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `bundler` input.

### Caching `bundle install` automatically

This action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:
```yaml
```

Note that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.

This caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  
It needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  
If there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.

To use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level
as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).

#### bundle config

When using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.
These can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.
They should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).
To find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.
You might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.

To perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  
Therefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).

#### How it Works

When there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.
In other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.
The hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.

#### Dealing with a corrupted cache

In some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system
at the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.
In order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value
if you have already used it before.)

```yaml
        cache-version: 1
```

#### Caching `bundle install` manually

It is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.
There are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).
So, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.

## Windows

Note that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.
It is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.

* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.
* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).
* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.
* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.
* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.
* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).
* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).

## Versioning

It is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.
This will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.

If you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and
it will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.
Make sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.

This action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.
This follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.

## Using self-hosted runners

This action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
if the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:

* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.
* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.
* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed
* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,
  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.
  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.
* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.

In other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case
(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).
You could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.

## History

This action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.
Please [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.

## :cloud: OS/Platform Support

Both `GitHub-hosted` and `self-hosted` runners are supported by `setup-php` on the following OS/Platforms.

### GitHub-Hosted Runners

| Virtual environment | YAML workflow label                | Pre-installed PHP      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Ubuntu 22.04        | `ubuntu-latest` or `ubuntu-22.04`  | `PHP 8.1`              |
| Ubuntu 20.04        | `ubuntu-20.04`                     | `PHP 7.4` to `PHP 8.2` |
| Windows Server 2022 | `windows-latest` or `windows-2022` | `PHP 8.2`              |
| Windows Server 2019 | `windows-2019`                     | `PHP 8.2`              |

| macOS Big Sur 11.x  | `macos-latest` or `macos-11`       | `PHP 8.2`              |

### Self-Hosted Runners

| Host OS/Virtual environment      | YAML workflow label        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Ubuntu 22.04                     | `self-hosted` or `Linux`   |
| Ubuntu 20.04                     | `self-hosted` or `Linux`   |
| Debian 11                        | `self-hosted` or `Linux`   |
| Debian 10                        | `self-hosted` or `Linux`   |
| Windows 7 and newer              | `self-hosted` or `Windows` |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer | `self-hosted` or `Windows` |
| macOS Ventura 13.x x86_64/arm64  | `self-hosted` or `macOS`   |
| macOS Monterey 12.x x86_64/arm64 | `self-hosted` or `macOS`   |
| macOS Big Sur 11.x x86_64/arm64  | `self-hosted` or `macOS`   |

- Refer to the [self-hosted setup](#self-hosted-setup) to use the action on self-hosted runners.
- Operating systems based on the above Ubuntu and Debian versions are also supported on best effort basis.
- If the requested PHP version is pre-installed, `setup-php` switches to it, otherwise it installs the PHP version.

## :tada: PHP Support

On all supported OS/Platforms the following PHP versions can be set up as per the runner.

- PHP 5.3 to PHP 8.3 on GitHub-hosted runners.
- PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.3 on self-hosted runners.

| PHP Version | Stability | Release Support       | Runner Support                 |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `5.3`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`                |
| `5.4`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`                |
| `5.5`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`                |
| `5.6`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `7.0`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `7.1`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `7.2`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `7.3`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `7.4`       | `Stable`  | `End of life`         | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `8.0`       | `Stable`  | `Security fixes only` | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `8.1`       | `Stable`  | `Active`              | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `8.2`       | `Stable`  | `Active`              | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |
| `8.3`       | `Nightly` | `In development`      | `GitHub-hosted`, `self-hosted` |

**Notes:**
- Specifying `8.3` in `php-version` input installs a nightly build of `PHP 8.3.0-dev`. See [nightly build setup](#nightly-build-setup) for more information.
- To use JIT on `PHP 8.0` and above, refer to the [JIT configuration](#jit-configuration) section.

## :heavy_plus_sign: PHP Extension Support

PHP extensions can be set up using the `extensions` input. It accepts a `string` in csv-format.

- On `Ubuntu`, extensions which are available as a package, available on `PECL` or a git repository can be set up.

```yaml
```

- On `Windows`, extensions available on `PECL` which have the `DLL` binary can be set up.

- On `macOS`, extensions available on `PECL` or a git repository can be set up.

- On `Ubuntu` and `macOS` to compile and install an extension from a git repository follow this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Add-extension-from-source ""Guide to compile and install PHP extensions in setup-php"").

- Extensions installed along with PHP if specified are enabled.

- Specific versions of extensions available on `PECL` can be set up by suffixing the extension\'s name with the version. This is useful for installing old versions of extensions which support end of life PHP versions.

```yaml
```

- Extensions with pre-release versions available on `PECL` can be set up by suffixing the extension\'s name with its state i.e `alpha`, `beta`, `devel` or `snapshot`.

```yaml
```

- On `Ubuntu` and `macOS` to compile and install an extension from PECL with libraries or custom configuration follow this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Add-extension-from-PECL-with-libraries-and-custom-configuration ""Guide to compile and install PHP extensions using PECL with libraries and custom configuration in setup-php"").

- Shared extensions can be disabled by prefixing them with a `:`. All extensions depending on the specified extension will also be disabled.

```yaml
```

- All shared extensions can be disabled by specifying `none`. When `none` is specified along with other extensions, it is hoisted to the start of the input. So, all the shared extensions will be disabled first, then rest of the extensions in the input will be processed.

**Note:** This disables all core and third-party shared extensions and thus, can break some tools which need them. Required extensions are enabled again when the tools are set up on a best-effort basis. So it is recommended to add the extensions required for your tools after `none` in the `extensions` input to avoid any issues.

```yaml
```

- Extension `intl` can be set up with specific `ICU` version for `PHP 5.6` and above in `Ubuntu` workflows by suffixing `intl` with the `ICU` version. `ICU 50.2` and newer versions are supported. Refer to [`ICU builds`](https://github.com/shivammathur/icu-intl#icu4c-builds) for the specific versions supported.

```yaml
```

- Extensions loaded by default after `setup-php` runs can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki).

- These extensions have custom support:
  - `cubrid` and `pdo_cubrid` on `Ubuntu`.
  - `event`, `gearman`, `geos` and `relay` on `Ubuntu` and `macOS`.
  - `blackfire`, `couchbase`, `ioncube`, `oci8`, `pdo_firebird`, `pdo_oci`, `pecl_http`, `phalcon3`, `phalcon4`, `phalcon5`, and `zephir_parser` on all supported OS.

- By default, extensions which cannot be added or disabled gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the execution is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set `fail-fast` flag to `true`.

```yaml
```

## :wrench: Tools Support

These tools can be set up globally using the `tools` input. It accepts a string in csv-format.

[`behat`], [`blackfire`], [`blackfire-player`], [`castor`], [`churn`], [`codeception`], [`composer`], [`composer-normalize`], [`composer-prefetcher`], [`composer-require-checker`], [`composer-unused`], [`cs2pr`], [`deployer`], [`flex`], [`grpc_php_plugin`], [`infection`], [`parallel-lint`], [`pecl`], [`phan`], [`phing`], [`phinx`], [`phive`], [`php-config`], [`php-cs-fixer`], [`phpcbf`], [`phpcpd`], [`phpcs`], [`phpdoc`] or [`phpDocumentor`], [`phpize`], [`phplint`], [`phpmd`], [`phpspec`], [`phpstan`], [`phpunit`], [`phpunit-bridge`], [`phpunit-polyfills`], [`pint`], [`prestissimo`], [`protoc`], [`psalm`], [`rector`], [`symfony`] or [`symfony-cli`], [`vapor`] or [`vapor-cli`], [`wp`] or [`wp-cli`]

```yaml
```

- In addition to above tools any composer tool or package can also be set up globally by specifying it as `vendor/package` matching the listing on Packagist. This format accepts the same [version constraints](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#writing-version-constraints ""Composer version constraints"") as `composer`.

```yaml
```

- To set up a particular version of a tool, specify it in the form `tool:version`.
  
  Version can be in the following format:
    - Semver. For example `tool:1.2.3` or `tool:1.2.3-beta1`.
    - Major version. For example `tool:1` or `tool:1.x`.
    - Major and minor version. For example `tool:1.2` or `tool:1.2.x`.
  
  When you specify just the major version or the version in `major.minor` format, the latest patch version matching the input will be setup. 

  With the exception of major versions of `composer`, if you specify only the `major` version or the version in `major.minor` format for a tool you can get rate limited by GitHub\'s API. To avoid this, it is recommended to provide a [`GitHub` OAuth token](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php#composer-github-oauth ""Composer GitHub OAuth"").
  You can do that by setting `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. The `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `GITHUB_TOKEN` and will be removed in the next major version.

```yaml
```

- The latest stable version of `composer` is set up by default. You can set up the required `composer` version by specifying the major version `v1` or `v2`, or the version in `major.minor` or `semver` format. Additionally, for composer `snapshot` and `preview` can also be specified to set up the respective releases.

```yaml
```

- If you do not use composer in your workflow, you can specify `tools: none` to skip it.

```yaml
```

- Tools `pear`, `pecl`, `phpize` and `php-config` are set up by default for all supported PHP versions on Linux and macOS.

- The latest version of `blackfire` cli is set up when `blackfire` is specified in tools input. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/ci/github-actions ""Blackfire.io documentation for GitHub Actions"") for using `blackfire` with GitHub Actions.

- Tools `prestissimo` and `composer-prefetcher` will be skipped unless `composer:v1` is also specified in tools input. It is recommended to drop `prestissimo` and use `composer v2`.

- By default, except `composer` tools which cannot be set up gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the execution is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set `fail-fast` flag to `true`.

```yaml
```

**Notes**
- Input `tools` is useful to set up tools which are only used in CI workflows, thus keeping your `composer.json` tidy.
- If you do not want to use all your dev-dependencies in workflow, you can run composer with `--no-dev` and install required tools using `tools` input to speed up your workflow.
- By default, `COMPOSER_NO_INTERACTION` is set to `1` and `COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT` is set to `0`. In effect, this means that Composer commands in your scripts do not need to specify `--no-interaction`.
- Also, `COMPOSER_NO_AUDIT` is set to `1`. So if you want to audit your dependencies for security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to add a `composer audit` step before you install them.

## :signal_strength: Coverage Support

### Xdebug

Specify `coverage: xdebug` to use `Xdebug` and disable `PCOV`.  
Runs on all [PHP versions supported](#tada-php-support ""List of PHP versions supported on this GitHub Action"").

```yaml
```

- When you specify `coverage: xdebug`, the latest version of Xdebug compatible with the PHP version is set up by default.
- If you need Xdebug 2.x on PHP 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, you can specify `coverage: xdebug2`.

```yaml
```

**Note**: Xdebug is enabled by default on Ubuntu GitHub Actions images, so if you are not using it in your workflow it is recommended to disable it as that will have a positive impact on your PHP performance. Please refer to the [disable coverage](#disable-coverage) section for details.

### PCOV

Specify `coverage: pcov` to use `PCOV` and disable `Xdebug`.  
Runs on PHP 7.1 and newer PHP versions.

- If your source code directory is other than `src`, `lib` or, `app`, specify `pcov.directory` using the `ini-values` input.  

```yaml
```

- PHPUnit 8.x and above supports PCOV out of the box.  
- If you are using PHPUnit 5.x, 6.x or 7.x, you need to set up `pcov/clobber` before executing your tests.

```yaml
```

### Disable Coverage

Specify `coverage: none` to disable both `Xdebug` and `PCOV`.

Disable coverage for these reasons:

- You are not generating coverage reports while testing.
- You are using `phpdbg` for running your tests.
- You are profiling your code using `blackfire`.
- You are using PHP in JIT mode. Please refer to [JIT configuration](#jit-configuration) section for more details.

```yaml
```

- See [force update setup](#force-update-setup) for more info.

See below for more info.

### Basic Setup

> Set up a particular PHP version.

```yaml
```

### Matrix Setup

> Set up multiple PHP versions on multiple operating systems.

```yaml
```

### Nightly Build Setup

> Set up a nightly build of `PHP 8.3`.

- This PHP version is currently in active development and might contain bugs and breaking changes.
- Some user space extensions might not support this version currently.

```yaml
```

### Debug Build Setup

> Set up a PHP build with debugging symbols.

- Production release builds of PHP without debugging symbols are set up by default.
- You can use the `debug` environment variable to set up a build with debugging symbols for PHP 5.6 and above.

```yaml
```

### Thread Safe Setup

> Set up `TS` or `NTS` PHP on `Linux` and `Windows`.

- `NTS` versions are set up by default.
- On `macOS` only `NTS` versions are supported currently.
- On `Linux` and `Windows` both `TS` and `NTS` versions are supported.

```yaml
```

### Force Update Setup

> Update to the latest patch of PHP versions.

- Pre-installed PHP versions are not updated to their latest patch release by default.
- If `ppa:ondrej/php` is missing on the Ubuntu GitHub environment, the PHP version is updated to the latest patch release.
- You can specify the `update` environment variable to `true` for updating to the latest release.

```yaml
```

### Verbose Setup

> Debug your workflow

To debug any issues, you can use the `verbose` tag instead of `v2`.

```yaml
```

### Multi-Arch Setup

> Set up PHP on multiple architecture on Ubuntu GitHub Runners.

- `PHP 5.6` to `PHP 8.2` are supported by `setup-php` on multiple architecture on `Ubuntu`.
- For this, you can use `shivammathur/node` images as containers. These have compatible `Nodejs` installed for `setup-php`.
- Currently, for `ARM` based setup, you will need [self-hosted runners](#self-hosted-setup).

```yaml
```

### Self Hosted Setup

> Set up PHP on a self-hosted runner.

- To set up a containerised self-hosted runner, refer to the following guides as per your base operating system.
  - [Linux](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Linux)
  - [Windows](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Windows)

- To set up the runner directly on the host OS or in a virtual machine, follow this [requirements guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Requirements-for-self-hosted-runners ""Requirements guide for self-hosted runner to run setup-php"") before setting up the self-hosted runner.
- If your workflow uses [service containers](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idservices ""GitHub Actions Services""), then set up the runner on a Linux host or in a Linux virtual machine. GitHub Actions does not support nested virtualization on Linux, so services will not work in a dockerized container.

It is recommended to specify the environment variable `runner` with the value `self-hosted` for self-hosted environments.

```yaml
```

**Notes**
- Do not set up multiple self-hosted runners on a single server instance as parallel workflow will conflict with each other.
- Do not set up self-hosted runners on the side on your development environment or your production server.
- Avoid using the same labels for your `self-hosted` runners which are used by `GitHub-hosted` runners.

### Local Testing Setup

> Test your `Ubuntu` workflow locally using [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act ""Project to test GitHub Actions locally"").

```yaml
```

Run the workflow locally with `act` using [`shivammathur/node`](https://github.com/shivammathur/node-docker ""Docker image to run setup-php"") docker images.

Choose the image tag which matches the `runs-on` property in your workflow. For example, if you are using `ubuntu-20.04` in your workflow, run `act -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:2004`.

```bash
```

### JIT Configuration

> Enable Just-in-time (JIT) on PHP 8.0 and above.

- To enable JIT, enable `opcache` in cli mode by setting `opcache.enable_cli=1`.
- JIT conflicts with `Xdebug`, `PCOV`, and other extensions which override `zend_execute_ex` function, so set `coverage: none` and disable any such extension if added.
- By default, `opcache.jit=1235` and `opcache.jit_buffer_size=256M` are set which can be changed using `ini-values` input.
- For detailed information about JIT related directives refer to the [`official PHP documentation`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.jit ""opcache.jit documentation"").

For example to enable JIT in `tracing` mode with buffer size of `64 MB`. 

```yaml
```

### Cache Extensions

You can cache PHP extensions using `shivammathur/cache-extensions` and `action/cache` GitHub Actions. Extensions which take very long to set up when cached are available in the next workflow run and are enabled directly. This reduces the workflow execution time.  
Refer to [`shivammathur/cache-extensions`](https://github.com/shivammathur/cache-extensions ""GitHub Action to cache php extensions"") for details.

### Cache Composer Dependencies

If your project uses composer, you can persist the composer\'s internal cache directory. Dependencies cached are loaded directly instead of downloading them while installation. The files cached are available across check-runs and will reduce the workflow execution time.

```yaml
```

**Notes**
- Please do not cache `vendor` directory using `action/cache` as that will have side effects.
- If you do not commit `composer.lock`, you can use the hash of `composer.json` as the key for your cache.
```yaml
```

- If you support a range of `composer` dependencies and use `prefer-lowest` and `prefer-stable` options, you can store them in your matrix and add them to the keys.
```yaml
```

### GitHub Composer Authentication

If you have a number of workflows which set up multiple tools or have many composer dependencies, you might hit the GitHub\'s rate limit for composer. Also, if you specify only the major version or the version in `major.minor` format, you can hit the rate limit. To avoid this you can specify an `OAuth` token by setting `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. You can use [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token ""GITHUB_TOKEN documentation"") secret for this purpose.

The `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `GITHUB_TOKEN` and will be removed in the next major version.

```yaml
```

### Private Packagist Authentication

If you use Private Packagist for your private composer dependencies, you can set the `PACKAGIST_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate.

```yaml
```

### Manual Composer Authentication

In addition to GitHub or Private Packagist, if you want to authenticate private repositories hosted elsewhere, you can set the `COMPOSER_AUTH_JSON` environment variable with the authentication methods and the credentials in json format.
Please refer to the authentication section in [`composer documentation`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md ""composer documentation"") for more details.

```yaml
```

### Inline PHP Scripts

If you have to run multiple lines of PHP code in your workflow, you can do that easily without saving it to a file.

Put the code in the run property of a step and specify the shell as `php {0}`.

```yaml
```

### Problem Matchers

Problem matchers are `json` configurations which identify errors and warnings in your logs and surface them prominently in the GitHub Actions UI by highlighting them and creating code annotations.

#### PHP

Setup problem matchers for your `PHP` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step.

```yaml
```

#### PHPUnit

Setup problem matchers for your `PHPUnit` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step.

```yaml
```

#### PHPStan

PHPStan supports error reporting in GitHub Actions, so it does not require problem matchers.

```yaml
```

#### Psalm

Psalm supports error reporting in GitHub Actions with an output format `github`.

```yaml
```

#### Tools with checkstyle support

For tools that support `checkstyle` reporting like `phpstan`, `psalm`, `php-cs-fixer` and `phpcs` you can use `cs2pr` to annotate your code.  
For examples refer to the [cs2pr documentation](https://github.com/staabm/annotate-pull-request-from-checkstyle).

> Here is an example with `phpcs`.

```yaml
```

## :bookmark: Versioning

- Use the `v2` tag as `setup-php` version. It is a rolling tag and is synced with the latest minor and patch releases. With `v2` you automatically get the bug fixes, security patches, new features and support for latest PHP releases.
- Semantic release versions can also be used. It is recommended to [use dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-github-dependabot ""Setup Dependabot with GitHub Actions"") with semantic versioning to keep the actions in your workflows up to date.
- Commit SHA can also be used, but are not recommended. They have to be updated with every release manually, without which you will not get any bug fixes, security patches or new features.
- For debugging any issues `verbose` tag can be used temporarily. It outputs all the logs and is also synced with the latest releases.
- It is highly discouraged to use the `master` branch as version, it might break your workflow after major releases as they have breaking changes.
- If you are using the `v1` tag or a `1.x.y` version, you should [switch to v2](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Switch-to-v2 ""Guide for switching from setup-php v1 to v2"") as `v1` only gets critical bug fixes. Maintenance support for `v1` will be dropped with the last `PHP 8.0` release.

![Dependabot enabled](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=actions-rs/toolchain)

This GitHub Action runs specified [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
command on a Rust language project.

**Table of Contents**

* [Example workflow](#example-workflow)
* [Use cases](#use-cases)
* [Inputs](#inputs)
* [Toolchain](#toolchain)
* [Cross-compilation](#cross-compilation)
* [License](#license)
* [Contribute and support](#contribute-and-support)

## Example workflow

```yaml
```

See [additional recipes here](https://github.com/actions-rs/meta).

## Use cases

Note that this Action is not required usually
and you can just use [`run`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun)
step instead as in example below:

```yaml
```

Why would you want to use this Action instead:

1. Transparent `cross` installation and execution with `use-cross: true` input enabled
2. Warnings and errors issued by `cargo` will be displayed in GitHub UI

## Inputs

| Name        | Required | Description                                                              | Type   | Default |
| ------------| :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------ | --------|
| `command`   | \xe2\x9c\x93        | Cargo command to run, ex. `check` or `build`                             | string |         |
| `toolchain` |          | Rust toolchain name to use                                               | string |         |
| `args`      |          | Arguments for the cargo command                                          | string |         |     
| `use-cross` |          | Use [`cross`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) instead of `cargo` | bool   | false   |

## Toolchain

By default this Action will call whatever `cargo` binary is available
in the current [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions).

You can use [`actions-rs/toolchain`](https://github.com/actions-rs/toolchain)
to install specific Rust toolchain with `cargo` included.

## Cross-compilation

In order to make cross-compile an easy process,
this Action can install [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross)
tool on demand if `use-cross` input is enabled; `cross` executable will be invoked
then instead of `cargo` automatically.

All consequent calls of this Action in the same job
with `use-cross: true` input enabled will use the same `cross` installed.

```yaml
```

This action sets up a [.NET CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk) environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a version(s) of dotnet by SDK version(s) and adding to PATH
- registering problem matchers for error output
- setting up authentication to private package sources like GitHub Packages

> **Note**: GitHub hosted runners have some versions of the .NET SDK
preinstalled. Installed versions are subject to change. Please refer to the
documentation:
[Software installed on github hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software)
for .NET SDK versions that are currently available.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

**Basic**:
```yaml
```
> **Warning**: Unless a concrete version is specified in the [`global.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file, **_the latest .NET version installed on the runner (including preinstalled versions) will be used [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection#the-sdk-uses-the-latest-installed-version)_**. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software) for the currently preinstalled .NET SDK versions.

**Multiple version installation**:
```yml
```
## Supported version syntax

The `dotnet-version` input supports following syntax:

- **A.B.C** (e.g 6.0.400, 7.0.100-preview.7.22377.5) - installs exact version of .NET SDK
- **A.B** or **A.B.x** (e.g. 3.1, 3.1.x) - installs the latest patch version of .NET SDK on the channel `3.1`, including prerelease versions (preview, rc)
- **A** or **A.x** (e.g. 3, 3.x) - installs the latest minor version of the specified major tag, including prerelease versions (preview, rc)
- **A.B.Cxx** (e.g. 6.0.4xx) - available since `.NET 5.0` release. Installs the latest version of the specific SDK release, including prerelease versions (preview, rc). 


## Using the `dotnet-quality` input
This input sets up the action to install the latest build of the specified quality in the channel. The possible values of `dotnet-quality` are: **daily**, **signed**, **validated**, **preview**, **ga**.

> **Note**: `dotnet-quality` input can be used only with .NET SDK version in \'A.B\', \'A.B.x\', \'A\', \'A.x\' and \'A.B.Cxx\' formats where the major version is higher than 5. In other cases, `dotnet-quality` input will be ignored.

```yml
```

## Using the `global-json-file` input
`setup-dotnet` action can read .NET SDK version from a `global.json` file. Input `global-json-file` is used for specifying the path to the `global.json`. If the file that was supplied to `global-json-file` input doesn\'t exist, the action will fail with error.

>**Note**: In case both `dotnet-version` and `global-json-file` inputs are used, versions from both inputs will be installed.

```yml
```

## Caching NuGet Packages
The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood for caching global packages data but requires less configuration settings. The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.

The action searches for [NuGet Lock files](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) (`packages.lock.json`) in the repository root, calculates their hash and uses it as a part of the cache key. If lock file does not exist, this action throws error. Use `cache-dependency-path` for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.

> **Warning**: Caching NuGet packages is available since .NET SDK 2.1.500 and 2.2.100 as the NuGet lock file [is available](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) only for NuGet 4.9 and above.

```yaml
```

> **Note**: This action will only restore `global-packages` folder, so you will probably get the [NU1403](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1403) error when running `dotnet restore`.
> To avoid this, you can use [`DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder`](https://github.com/dotnet/reproducible-builds/blob/abfe986832aa28597d3340b92469d1a702013d23/Documentation/Reproducible-MSBuild/Techniques/DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder.md) option.

```xml
```

### Reduce caching size

> **Note**: Use [`NUGET_PACKAGES`](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-environment-variables) environment variable if available. Some action runners already has huge libraries. (ex. Xamarin)

```yaml
env:
  NUGET_PACKAGES: ${{ github.workspace }}/.nuget/packages
```

### Caching NuGet packages in monorepos

```yaml
```

## Matrix Testing
Using `setup-dotnet` it\'s possible to use [matrix syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) to install several versions of .NET SDK:
```yml
```
>**Note**: Unless a concrete version is specified in the [`global.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file, the latest .NET version installed on the runner (including preinstalled versions) will be used [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection#the-sdk-uses-the-latest-installed-version). To control this behavior you may want to use temporary `global.json` files:

**Matrix testing with temporary global.json creation**
```yml
```
## Setting up authentication for nuget feeds

### Github Package Registry (GPR)
```yml
```

### Azure Artifacts
```yml
```

### nuget.org
```yml
```
> **Note**: It\'s the only way to push a package to nuget.org feed for macOS/Linux machines due to API key config store limitations.

# Outputs and environment variables

## Outputs

### `dotnet-version`

Using the **dotnet-version** output it\'s possible to get the installed by the action .NET SDK version. 

**Single version installation**

In case of a single version installation, the `dotnet-version` output contains the version that is installed by the action.

```yaml
```

**Multiple version installation**

In case of a multiple version installation, the `dotnet-version` output contains the latest version that is installed by the action.

```yaml
```
**Installation from global.json**

When the `dotnet-version` input is used along with the `global-json-file` input, the `dotnet-version` output contains the version resolved from the `global.json`.

```yaml
```

### `cache-hit`
A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the cache key (follows [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache#outputs))

## Environment variables

Some environment variables may be necessary for your particular case or to improve logging. Some examples are listed below, but the full list with complete details can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables

| **Env.variable**      | **Description** | **Default value** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR      |Specifies a directory where .NET SDKs should be installed by the action.|*default value for each OS* |
| DOTNET_NOLOGO      |Removes logo and telemetry message from first run of dotnet cli|*false*|
| DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT   |Opt-out of telemetry being sent to Microsoft|*false*|
| DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP   |Configures whether the global install location is used as a fall-back|*true*|
| NUGET_PACKAGES |Configures a path to the [NuGet `global-packages` folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders)|*default value for each OS* |

The default values of the `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` and `NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variables depend on the operation system which is used on a runner:
| **Operation system** | `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` | `NUGET_PACKAGES` |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Windows** | `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet` | `%userprofile%\\.nuget\\packages` |
| **Ubuntu** | `/usr/share/dotnet` | `~/.nuget/packages` |
| **macOS** | `/Users/runner/.dotnet` | `~/.nuget/packages` |

**Example usage of environment variable**:
```yml
```

[![Project Status: Active \xe2\x80\x93 The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)


A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to send a message to a Slack channel.

**Screenshot**

<img width=""485"" alt=""action-slack-notify-rtcamp"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54996943-9d38c700-4ff0-11e9-9d35-7e2c16ef0d62.png"">

The `Site` and `SSH Host` details are only available if this action is run after [Deploy WordPress GitHub action](https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress).

## Usage

You can use this action after any other action. Here is an example setup of this action:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml` file in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `slack-notify.yml` file.

```yml
```

3. Create `SLACK_WEBHOOK` secret using [GitHub Action\'s Secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can [generate a Slack incoming webhook token from here](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).


## Environment Variables

By default, action is designed to run with minimal configuration but you can alter Slack notification using following environment variables:

Variable          | Default                                               | Purpose
------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLACK_CHANNEL     | Set during Slack webhook creation                     | Specify Slack channel in which message needs to be sent
SLACK_USERNAME    | `rtBot`                                               | Custom Slack Username sending the message. Does not need to be a ""real"" username.
SLACK_MSG_AUTHOR  | `$GITHUB_ACTOR` (The person who triggered action).    | GitHub username of the person who has triggered the action. In case you want to modify it, please specify corrent GitHub username.
SLACK_ICON        | ![rtBot Avatar](https://github.com/rtBot.png?size=32) | User/Bot icon shown with Slack message. It uses the URL supplied to this env variable to display the icon in slack message.
SLACK_ICON_EMOJI  | -                                                     | User/Bot icon shown with Slack message, in case you do not wish to add a URL for slack icon as above, you can set slack emoji in this env variable. Example value: `:bell:` or any other valid slack emoji.
SLACK_COLOR       | `good` (green)                                        | You can pass `${{ job.status }}` for automatic coloring or an RGB value like `#efefef` which would change color on left side vertical line of Slack message.
SLACK_LINK_NAMES  | -                                                     | If set to `true`, enable mention in Slack message. 
SLACK_MESSAGE     | Generated from git commit message.                    | The main Slack message in attachment. It is advised not to override this.
SLACK_TITLE       | Message                                               | Title to use before main Slack message.
SLACK_FOOTER      | Powered By rtCamp\'s GitHub Actions Library            | Slack message footer.
MSG_MINIMAL       | -                                                     | If set to `true`, removes: `Ref`, `Event`,  `Actions URL` and `Commit` from the message. You can optionally whitelist any of these 4 removed values by passing it comma separated to the variable instead of `true`. (ex: `MSG_MINIMAL: event` or `MSG_MINIMAL: ref,actions url`, etc.)

You can see the action block with all variables as below:

```yml
```

Below screenshot help you visualize message part controlled by different variables:

<img width=""600"" alt=""Screenshot_2019-03-26_at_5_56_05_PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54997488-d1f94e00-4ff1-11e9-897f-a35ab90f525f.png"">

The `Site` and `SSH Host` details are only available if this action is run after [Deploy WordPress GitHub action](https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress).

## Hashicorp Vault (Optional)

This GitHub action supports [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

To enable Hashicorp Vault support, please define following GitHub secrets:

Variable      | Purpose                                                                       | Example Vaule
--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
`VAULT_ADDR`  | [Vault server address](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#vault_addr) | `https://example.com:8200`
`VAULT_TOKEN` | [Vault token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html)          | `s.gIX5MKov9TUp7iiIqhrP1HgN`

You will need to change `secrets` line in `slack-notify.yml` file to look like below.

```yml
```

GitHub action uses `VAULT_TOKEN` to connect to `VAULT_ADDR` to retrieve slack webhook from Vault.

In the Vault, the Slack webhook should be setup as field `webhook` on path `secret/slack`.

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Create a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to create releases.

<a href=""https://github.com/actions/create-release""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/create-release/workflows/Tests/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

- `tag_name`: The name of the tag for this release
- `release_name`: The name of the release
- `body`: Text describing the contents of the release. Optional, and not needed if using `body_path`.
- `body_path`: A file with contents describing the release. Optional, and not needed if using `body`.
- `draft`: `true` to create a draft (unpublished) release, `false` to create a published one. Default: `false`
- `prerelease`: `true` to identify the release as a prerelease. `false` to identify the release as a full release. Default: `false`
- `commitish` : Any branch or commit SHA the Git tag is created from, unused if the Git tag already exists. Default: SHA of current commit
- `owner`: The name of the owner of the repo. Used to identify the owner of the repository.  Used when cutting releases for external repositories.  Default: Current owner
- `repo`: The name of the repository. Used to identify the repository on which to release.  Used when cutting releases for external repositories. Default: Current repository

#### `body_path`
The `body_path` is valuable for dynamically creating a `.md` within code commits and even within the Github Action steps leading up to the `create-release`.

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The release ID
- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`
- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action

### Example workflow - create a release
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):

```yaml
```

This will create a [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases), as well as a [`release` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#releaseevent), which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action. This uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by the [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret), so no new token is needed.

23,"# `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda`

This action sets up a `base`
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment by one of:

- locating the `conda` installation [bundled] with the available runners and
  available in `$CONDA`
- installing a specific (or latest) version of
  - [Miniconda3][miniconda-repo]
  - [Miniforge][miniforge-releases] (or Mambaforge)
  - any [constructor]-based installer by or URL or filesystem path

A `conda-build-version` or `mamba-version` may be provided to install into
`base`.

The base `condabin/` folder is added to `$PATH` and shell integration is
initialized across all platforms.

By default, this action will then create, and _activate_, an environment by one
of:

- creating a mostly-empty `test` environment, containing only the latest
  `python-version` and its dependencies
- creating an `test` environment described in a given `environment-file`:
  - an `environment.yml`-like file (which can be patched with `python-version`)
    - the patched environment will be cleaned up unless
      `clean-patched-environment-file: false` is given
  - a [lockfile](#example-7-lockfiles)

This action correctly handles activation of environments and offers the
possibility of automatically activating the `test` environment on all shells.

> **Please** see the **[IMPORTANT](#important)** notes on additional information
> on environment activation.

## Environment activation

This action will by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_
activate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the
`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the
`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.

## Inputs and outputs

For a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see
[action.yml](action.yml).

### Use a different environment name or path

You can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path
by setting the `activate-environment` input option.

```yaml
```

This will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is
the path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""
Miniconda installation.

> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will
>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology. Use this to
>   avoid ""path too long""-style errors, especially on Windows.
> - Self-hosted runners can emulate the ""bundled"" Miniconda approach by
>   pre-installing a [constructor]-based installer and ensuring `$CONDA` is set
>   prior to starting `setup-miniconda`

### Activate `base` environment

If your specific workflow still needs to activate and use `base` you will need
to do **both** of:

- set `activate-environment` to an empty string
- set `auto-activate-base` to `true`

```yaml
```

## Usage examples

### Example 1: Basic usage

This example shows how to set a basic python workflow with conda using the
crossplatform available shells: `bash` and `pwsh`. On this example an
environment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`
installed for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.

```yaml
```

### Example 2: Other shells

This example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating
systems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version
available and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.

```yaml
```

### Example 3: Other options

This example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for
easier creation of test/build environments and
[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration
management. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an
environment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment
before activating the `anaconda-client-env`.

```yaml
```

### Example 4: Conda options

This example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The
priority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will
result in:

- conda-forge
- spyder-ide
- defaults

```yaml
```

### Example 5: Custom installer

Any installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)
which includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not
yet supported by Miniconda. For more, see [Example 10](#example-10-miniforge).

> Notes:
>
> - Installer downloads are cached based on their full URL: adding some
>   non-functional salt to the URL will prevent this behavior, e.g.
>   `#${{ github.run_number }}`

```yaml
```

### Example 6: Mamba

Experimental! Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.
`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires
you specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest
priority.

> Notes:
>
> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it
>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)
>   with `use-mamba: true`.

```yaml
```

### Example 7: Lockfiles

`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit
environment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution
step altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to
reproduce the environment.

This means explicitly-defined environments...

- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:
  - channels are not queried for their repo data
  - no solver is run
- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain
  platform/architecture information
- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable

This approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow
that runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.

[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock
[explicit-spec]:
  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments

```yaml
```

### Example 10: Miniforge

[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) provides a number of
alternatives to Miniconda, built from the ground up with `conda-forge` packages
and with only `conda-forge` in its default channels.

If only `miniforge-version` is provided, `Miniforge3` will be used.

```yaml
```

In addition to `Miniforge3` with `conda` and `CPython`, for each of its many
supported platforms and architectures, additional variants including
`Mambaforge` (which comes pre-installed `mamba` in addition to `conda` on all
platforms) and `Miniforge-pypy3`/`Mamabaforge-pypy3` (which replace `CPython`
with `pypy3` on Linux/MacOS) are available.

```yaml
```

### Example 11: Alternative Architectures

In addition to the default 64-bit builds of Miniconda, 32-bit versions are
available for Windows. Note that although some x86 builds are available for
Linux and MacOS, these are too old (<4.6) to be supported by this action.

```yaml
```

## Caching

### Caching packages

If you want to enable package caching for conda you can use the
[cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) using `~/conda_pkgs_dir` as
path for conda packages.

The cache will use a explicit key for restoring and saving the cache.

This can be based in the contents of files like:

- `setup.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `environment.yml`

```yaml
```

If you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then
you may want to
[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),
as they are not included in the conda package cache.

### Caching environments

The first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without specifying
a environment file.

```yaml
```

It\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies of
package versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. Here we ensure
that this happens by adding the current date to the cache key. You can remove
the ""Get Date"" step below if you use a resolved environment file product of
`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.

```yaml
```

Keep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the same
as hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves the
dependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages available on
the channels at installation time. Since packages are updated all the time, you
will not see these changes reflected in the cache until the key gets updated by
date.

**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally but
fail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache manually to
see if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved environment file.**

Finally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache does
not exist.

```yaml
```

### Use a default shell

Assuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -el {0}` to
every single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all
the steps.

By adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -el {0}`, all steps in
the job will default to that value.

For other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default
value. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.

More information the
[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).

```yaml
```

## IMPORTANT

- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -el {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are
  executed with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated
  on bash profile files made by `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)
  and
  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).
- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly
  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed
  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by
  `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are
  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag
  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which
  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`
  option to `true`.
- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda
  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a
  version of conda compatible with the option.
- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the
  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide
  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was
  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts
  and result in very long install times.
- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`. Please use `bash`.

24,"# Download-Artifact v3

This downloads artifacts from your build

See also [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).

# What's new

- Download all artifacts at once
- Output parameter for the download path
- Port entire action to typescript from a runner plugin so it is easier to collaborate and accept contributions

Refer [here](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/v2) for the previous version

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

# Download a Single Artifact

Basic (download to the current working directory):
```yaml
```

Download to a specific directory:
```yaml
```

Basic tilde expansion is supported for the `path` input:
```yaml
```

## Compatibility between `v1` and `v2`/`v3`

When using `download-artifact@v1`, a directory denoted by the name of the artifact would be created if the `path` input was not provided. All of the contents would be downloaded to this directory.
```
```

With `v2` and `v3`, when an artifact is specified by the `name` input, there is no longer an extra directory that is created if the `path` input is not provided. All the contents are downloaded to the current working directory.
```
```

To maintain the same behavior for `v2` and `v3`, you can set the `path` to the name of the artifact so an extra directory gets created.
```
```


# Download All Artifacts

If the `name` input parameter is not provided, all artifacts will be downloaded. **To differentiate between downloaded artifacts, a directory denoted by the artifacts name will be created for each individual artifact.**
Example, if there are two artifacts `Artifact-A` and `Artifact-B`, and the directory is `etc/usr/artifacts/`, the directory structure will look like this:
```
```

Download all artifacts to a specific directory
```yaml
```

Download all artifacts to the current working directory
```yaml
```

# Download path output

The `download-path` step output contains information regarding where the artifact was downloaded to. This output can be used for a variety of purposes such as logging or as input to other actions. Be aware of the extra directory that is created if downloading all artifacts (no name specified).

```yaml
```

> Note: The `id` defined in the `download/artifact` step must match the `id` defined in the `echo` step (i.e `steps.[ID].outputs.download-path`)

# Limitations

### Permission Loss

:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.

### Case Insensitive Uploads

:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.

### Maintaining file permissions and case sensitive files

If file permissions and case sensitivity are required, you can `tar` all of your files together before artifact upload. Post download, the `tar` file will maintain file permissions and case sensitivity.

```yaml
```

# @actions/artifact package

Internally the [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) NPM package is used to interact with artifacts. You can find additional documentation there along with all the source code related to artifact download.

# PyPI publish GitHub Action

This action allows you to upload your [Python distribution packages]
in the `dist/` directory to PyPI.
This text suggests a minimalistic usage overview. For more detailed
walkthrough check out the [PyPA guide].

If you have any feedback regarding specific action versions, please leave
comments in the corresponding [per-release announcement discussions].


## \xf0\x9f\x8c\x87 `master` branch sunset \xe2\x9d\x97

The `master` branch version has been sunset. Please, change the GitHub
Action version you use from `master` to `release/v1` or use an exact
tag, or opt-in to [use a full Git commit SHA] and Dependabot.


## Usage

### Trusted publishing

> **NOTE**: Trusted publishing is sometimes referred to by its
> underlying technology -- OpenID Connect, or OIDC for short.
> If you see references to ""OIDC publishing"" in the context of PyPI,
> this is what they\'re referring to.

This example jumps right into the current best practice. If you want to
use API tokens directly or a less secure username and password, check out
[how to specify username and password].

This action supports PyPI\'s [trusted publishing]
implementation, which allows authentication to PyPI without a manually
configured API token or username/password combination. To perform
[trusted publishing] with this action, your project\'s
publisher must already be configured on PyPI.

To enter the trusted publishing flow, configure this action\'s job with the
`id-token: write` permission and **without** an explicit username or password:

```yaml
```

> **Pro tip**: instead of using branch pointers, like `unstable/v1`, pin
versions of Actions that you use to tagged versions or sha1 commit identifiers.
This will make your workflows more secure and better reproducible, saving you
from sudden and unpleasant surprises.

Other indices that support trusted publishing can also be used, like TestPyPI:

```yaml
```
_(don\'t forget to update the environment name to `testpypi` or similar!)_

> **Pro tip**: only set the `id-token: write` permission in the job that does
> publishing, not globally. Also, try to separate building from publishing
> \xe2\x80\x94 this makes sure that any scripts maliciously injected into the build
> or test environment won\'t be able to elevate privileges while flying under
> the radar.

A common use case is to upload packages only on a tagged commit, to do so add a
filter to the job:

```yml
```


## Non-goals

This GitHub Action [has nothing to do with _building package
distributions_]. Users are responsible for preparing dists for upload
by putting them into the `dist/` folder prior to running this Action.

> **IMPORTANT**: Since this GitHub Action is docker-based, it can only
> be used from within GNU/Linux based jobs in GitHub Actions CI/CD
> workflows. This is by design and is unlikely to change due to a number
> of considerations we rely on.
>
> This should not stop one from publishing platform-specific
> distribution packages, though. It is strongly advised to separate jobs
> for building the OS-specific wheels from the publish job. This allows
> one to (1) test exactly the same artifacts that are about to be
> uploaded to PyPI, (2) prevent parallel unsynchronized jobs from
> publishing only part of the dists asynchronously (in case when part of
> the jobs fail and others succeed ending up with an incomplete release
> on PyPI) and (3) make an atomic upload to PyPI (when part of the dists
> appear on PyPI, installers like pip will use that version for the
> dependency resolution but this may cause some environments to use
> sdists while the wheel for their runtime is not yet available).
>
> To implement this sort of orchestration, please use
> `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions for
> sharing the built dists across stages and jobs. Then, use the `needs`
> setting to order the build, test and publish stages.


## Advanced release management

For best results, figure out what kind of workflow fits your
project\'s specific needs.

For example, you could implement a parallel job that
pushes every commit to TestPyPI or your own index server,
like `devpi`. For this, you\'d need to (1) specify a custom
`repository-url` value and (2) generate a unique version
number for each upload so that they\'d not create a conflict.
The latter is possible if you use `setuptools_scm` package but
you could also invent your own solution based on the distance
to the latest tagged commit.

You\'ll need to create another token for a separate host and then [save it as a
GitHub repo secret][Creating & using secrets] under an environment used in
your job. Though, passing a password would disable the secretless [trusted
publishing] so it\'s better to configure it instead, when publishing to TestPyPI
and not something custom.

The action invocation in this case would look like:
```yml
```

### Customizing target package dists directory

You can change the default target directory of `dist/`
to any directory of your liking. The action invocation
would now look like:

```yml
```

### Disabling metadata verification

It is recommended that you run `twine check` just after producing your files,
but this also runs `twine check` before upload. You can also disable the twine
check with:

```yml
```

### Tolerating release package file duplicates

Sometimes, when you publish releases from multiple places, your workflow
may hit race conditions. For example, when publishing from multiple CIs
or even having workflows with the same steps triggered within GitHub
Actions CI/CD for different events concerning the same high-level act.

To facilitate this use-case, you may use `skip-existing` (disabled by
default) setting as follows:

```yml
```

> **Pro tip**: try to avoid enabling this setting where possible. If you
have steps for publishing to both PyPI and TestPyPI, consider only using
it for the latter, having the former fail loudly on duplicates.

### For Debugging

Sometimes, `twine upload` can fail and to debug use the `verbose` setting as follows:

```yml
```

### Showing hash values of files to be uploaded

You may want to verify whether the files on PyPI were automatically uploaded by CI script.
It will show SHA256, MD5, BLAKE2-256 values of files to be uploaded.

```yml
```

### Specifying a different username

The default username value is `__token__`. If you publish to a custom
registry that does not provide API tokens, like `devpi`, you may need to
specify a custom username and password pair. This is how it\'s done.

```yml
```

The secret used in `${{ secrets.DEVPI_PASSWORD }}` needs to be created on the
environment page under the settings of your project on GitHub.
See [Creating & using secrets].

In the past, when publishing to PyPI, the most secure way of the access scoping
for automatic publishing was to use the [API tokens][PyPI API token] feature of
PyPI. One would make it project-scoped and save as an environment-bound secret
in their GitHub repository settings, naming it `${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}`,
for example. See [Creating & using secrets]. While still secure,
[trusted publishing] is now encouraged over API tokens as a best practice
on supported platforms (like GitHub).

26,"# Commitlint Github Action

Lints Pull Request commits with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).

## Usage

Create a github workflow in the `.github` folder, e.g. `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml`:

```yaml
```

Alternatively, you can run on other event types such as `on: [push]`. In that case the action will lint the push event\'s commit(s) instead of linting commits from a pull request. You can also combine `push` and `pull_request` together in the same workflow.

## Inputs

You can supply these inputs to the `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` step.

### `configFile`

The path to your commitlint config file.

Default: `commitlint.config.js`

If the config file doesn\'t exist, [config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) settings will be loaded as a default fallback.

Details on the configuration file can be found on [the commitlint website](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-configuration).

### `failOnWarnings`

Whether you want to fail on warnings or not.

Default: `false`

### `failOnErrors`

Whether you want to fail on errors or not. Still outputs the results, just forces the action to pass even if errors are detected.

Default: `true`

### `helpURL`

Link to a page explaining your commit message convention.

default: `https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint`

### `commitDepth`

When set to a valid Integer value - X, considers only the latest X number of commits.

default: `null` (Equivalent to linting all commits)

### `token`

Personal access token (PAT) used to interact with the GitHub API.
By default, the automatic token provided by GitHub is used.
You can see more info about GitHub\'s default token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token).

default: `${{ github.token }}`

## Outputs

### `results`

The error and warning messages for each one of the analyzed commits. This is useful if you want to use the commitlint results in a JSON format in other jobs. See [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#fromjson) on how to read JSON information from outputs.

Below you can see an example text output together with its corresponding JSON output:

```
```

```JSON
```

## About `extends` in your config file

This is a [`Docker` action](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/e2adf403d6d14a9ca7474976ccaca20f72ff8209/docs/action-types.md#why-would-i-choose-a-docker-action), and was made like this so that you can run it with minimum setup, regardless of your repo\'s environment. It comes packed with the most famous shared configurations that you can use in your commitlint config\'s `extends` field:

- [@commitlint/config-angular](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-angular)
- [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)
- [@commitlint/config-lerna-scopes](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-lerna-scopes)
- [@commitlint/config-patternplate](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-patternplate)
- [conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical](https://github.com/gajus/conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical)
- [commitlint-config-jira](https://github.com/Gherciu/commitlint-jira)
- [commitlint-config-function-rules](https://github.com/vidavidorra/commitlint-plugin-function-rules#readme)

Apart from the shared configurations that are included by default, you can also include extra dependencies for other configs and plugins that you want to use.

In order to do so, you can use `NODE_PATH` env var to make the action take those dependencies into account. Below is an example workflow that does that.

```yaml
```

\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 You can see other ways to install your dependencies (including private ones) in [the Setup Node action\'s docs](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).

Github Action to create maven settings (`~/.m2/settings.xml`). 

Supports `<servers>`, `<repositories>`, `<pluginRepositories>`, `<pluginGroups>`, `<mirrors>`, `<activeProfiles>`, `<proxies>`, and `<profiles>`.

## Inputs

### `servers`

**Optional** json array of servers to add to settings.xml.
* **id** - The ID of the server (not of the user to login as) that matches the id element of the repository/mirror that Maven tries to connect to.
* **username**, **password** - These elements appear as a pair denoting the login and password required to authenticate to this server.
* **privateKey**, **passphrase** - Like the previous two elements, this pair specifies a path to a private key (default is `${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa`) and a `passphrase`, if required. 
* **filePermissions**, **directoryPermissions** - When a repository file or directory is created on deployment, these are the permissions to use. The legal values of each is a three digit number corresponding to *nix file permissions, e.g. 664, or 775.
* **configuration** - Any additional custom configuration for server in JSON format.

Reference: [Maven Settings > Servers](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#servers)

### `mirrors`

* **id** - The unique identifier of this mirror. The `id` is used to differentiate between mirror elements and to pick the corresponding credentials from the `<servers>` section when connecting to the mirror.
* **mirrorOf** - The `id` of the repository that this is a mirror of. For example, to point to a mirror of the Maven central repository (`https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/`), set this element to `central`. More advanced mappings like `repo1,repo2` or `*,!inhouse` are also possible. This must not match the mirror `id`.
* **url** - The base URL of this mirror. The build system will use this URL to connect to a repository rather than the original repository URL.

Reference: [Maven Settings > Mirrors](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#mirrors)

### `repositories`
**Optional** json array of repositories to add to settings.xml
* **id** - The ID of the repository that matches the id element of the server.
* **name** - Name of the repository.
* **url** - URL to connect to repository.
* **releases.enabled** - Enable release policy.
* **snapshots.enabled** - Enable snapshot policy.

When not `repostories` is empty or null, the Maven Central repository is applied by default:

```yaml
```

Reference: [Maven Settings > Repositories](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#repositories)

### `plugin_repositories`
**Optional** json array of repositories to add to settings.xml
* **id** - The ID of the repository that matches the id element of the server.
* **name** - Name of the repository.
* **url** - URL to connect to repository.
* **releases.enabled** - Enable release policy.
* **snapshots.enabled** - Enable snapshot policy.

Reference: [Maven Settings > Plugin Repositories](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Plugin_Repositories)

### `plugin_groups`
**Optional** json array of plugin groups to add to settings.xml

Reference: [Maven Settings > Plugin Groups](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Plugin_Groups)

### `profiles`
**Optional** json array of profiles to add to settings.xml

The `profile` element in the `settings.xml` is a truncated version of the `pom.xml` `profile` element. It consists of the `activation`, `repositories`, `pluginRepositories` and `properties` elements. The `profile` elements only include these four elements because they concerns themselves with the build system as a whole (which is the role of the `settings.xml` file), not about individual project object model settings.

Reference: [Maven Settings > Profiles](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#profiles)

### `active_profiles`
**Optional** json array of active profiles to add to settings.xml

Set of `activeProfile` elements, which each have a value of a `profile` `id`. Any `profile` `id` defined as an `activeProfile` will be active, regardless of any environment settings. If no matching profile is found nothing will happen. For example, if `env-test` is an `activeProfile`, a profile in a `pom.xml` (or `profile.xml`) with a corresponding `id` will be active. If no such profile is found then execution will continue as normal.

Reference: [Maven Settings > Active Profiles](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Active_Profiles)

### `proxies`

**Optional** json array of proxies to add to settings.xml.
* **id** - The unique identifier for this proxy. This is used to differentiate between proxy elements.
* **active** - true if this proxy is active. This is useful for declaring a set of proxies, but only one may be active at a time.
* **protocol, host, port** - The protocol://host:port of the proxy, separated into discrete elements.
* **username, password** - These elements appear as a pair denoting the login and password required to authenticate to this proxy server.
* **nonProxyHosts** - This is a list of hosts which should not be proxied. The delimiter of the list is the expected type of the proxy server; the example above is pipe delimited - comma delimited is also common.


Reference: [Maven Settings > Proxies](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#proxies)

### `output_file`
**Optional** String path of to generate `settings.xml`. By default, `~/.m2/settings.xml` is used. 

When using a custom `output_file`, for example:
```yaml
```

The generated `settings.xml` will be created at `/home/runner/work/{repo}/foo/custom.xml`, which can be referenced in maven steps using `mvn --settings foo/custom.xml {goal}`.

For more complex configuration, you may wish to use a Ruby style file.
In this case, your `.mdlrc` file should contain a link to the style file:

```sh
```

which can contain arbitrary Ruby code:

```rb
```

More information can be found in the [mdl documentation](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/creating_styles.md).

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/D1D07SSY7)

This GitHub action checks all Markdown files in your repository for broken links. (Uses [tcort/markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check))

## How to use
1. Create a new file in your repository `.github/workflows/action.yml`.
1. Copy-paste the following workflow in your `action.yml` file:

   ```yml
   name: Check Markdown links

   on: push

   jobs:
     markdown-link-check:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@master
          ```

## Configuration

- [Custom variables](#custom-variables)
- [Scheduled runs](#scheduled-runs)
- [Disable check for some links](#disable-check-for-some-links)
- [Check only modified files in a pull request](#check-only-modified-files-in-a-pull-request)
- [Check multiple directories and files](#check-multiple-directories-and-files)
- [Status code 429: Too many requests](#too-many-requests)
- [GitHub links failure fix](#github-links-failure-fix)

### Custom variables
You customize the action by using the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Default value |
|:----------|:--------------|:-----------|
|`use-quiet-mode`| Specify `yes` to only show errors in output.| `no`|
|`use-verbose-mode`|Specify `yes` to show detailed HTTP status for checked links. |`no` |
|`config-file`|Specify a [custom configuration file](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check#config-file-format) for markdown-link-check. You can use it to remove false-positives by specifying replacement patterns and ignore patterns. The filename is interpreted relative to the repository root.|`mlc_config.json`|
|`folder-path` |By default the `github-action-markdown-link-check` action checks for all markdown files in your repository. Use this option to limit checks to only specific folders. Use comma separated values for checking multiple folders. |`.` |
|`max-depth` |Specify how many levels deep you want to check in the directory structure. The default value is `-1` which means check all levels.|`-1` |
|`check-modified-files-only` |Use this variable to only check modified markdown files instead of checking all markdown files. The action uses `git` to find modified markdown files. Only use this variable when you run the action to check pull requests.|`no`|
|`base-branch`|Use this variable to specify the branch to compare when finding modified markdown files. |`master`|
|`file-extension`|By default the `github-action-markdown-link-check` action checks files in your repository with the `.md` extension. Use this option to specify a different file extension such as `.markdown` or `.mdx`.|`.md`|
|`file-path` | Specify additional files (with complete path and extension) you want to check. Use comma separated values for checking multiple files. See [Check multiple directories and files](#check-multiple-directories-and-files) section for usage.| - |

#### Sample workflow with variables

```yml
```

### Scheduled runs
In addition to checking links on every push, or pull requests, its also a good
hygiene to check for broken links regularly as well. See
[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions - on.schedule](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule)
for more details.

#### Sample workflow with scheduled job

```yml
```

### Disable check for some links
You can include the following HTML comments into your markdown files to disable
checking for certain links in a markdown document.

1. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->` and `<!-- markdown-link-check-enable-->`: Use these to disable links for all links appearing between these
    comments.
   - Example:
     ```md
     <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
     ## Section

     Disbale link checking in this section. Ignore this [Bad Link](https://exampleexample.cox)
     <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
     ```
2. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->` Use this comment to disable link checking for the next line.
3. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->` Use this comment to disable link
   checking for the current line.

### Check only modified files in a pull request

Use the following workflow to only check links in modified markdown files in a
pull request.

When
you use this variable, the action finds modified files between two commits:
- latest commit in you PR
- latest commit in the `master` branch. If you are suing a different branch to
  merge PRs, specify the branch using `base-branch`.

> **NOTE**: We can also use GitHub API to get all modified files in a PR, but that
> would require tokens and stuff, create an issue or PR if you need that.

```yml
```

### Check multiple directories and files

```yml
```

### Too many requests
Use `retryOn429`, `retry-after`, `retryCount`, and `fallbackRetryDelay` in your custom configuration file.
See https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check#config-file-format for details.

Or mark 429 status code as alive:
```json
```

### GitHub links failure fix
Use the following `httpHeaders` in your custom configuration file to fix GitHub links failure.

```json
```

## Example Usage

Consider a workflow file that checks for the status of hyperlinks on push to the master branch,

``` yml
```
A file `test.md` exists, containing

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53875297/159135478-87194037-f3d6-4ca9-9da8-f01dac482fbc.png)

On running the workflow described above, the output shown below is obtained

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53875297/159135426-9f439d39-8bb3-40f0-9255-9efe2b493c1a.png)


## Versioning
GitHub Action - Markdown link check follows the [GitHub recommended versioning strategy](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md).

1. To use a specific released version of the action ([Releases](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check/releases)):
   ```yml
      ```
1. To use a major version of the action:
   ```yml
      ```
1. You can also specify a [specific commit SHA](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check/commits/master) as an action version:
   ```yml
      ```

**Please note: This action is deprecated and should no longer be used. The team at GitHub has ceased making and accepting code contributions or maintaining issues tracker. Please, migrate your workflows to the [ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby), which is being actively maintained by the official Ruby organization.**


This action sets up a ruby environment for versions which are installed on the [Actions Virtual Environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).

Virtual environments contain only one Ruby version within a \'major.minor\' release, and are updated with new releases.  Hence, a workflow should only be bound to minor versions.

Note that a `ruby-version:` of `2.6` or `2.6.x` are equivalent.

> Supports `2.4`, `2.5`, `2.6`, and `2.7`.

This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

- Optionally downloading and caching distribution of the requested Node.js version, and adding it to the PATH
- Optionally caching npm/yarn/pnpm dependencies
- Registering problem matchers for error output
- Configuring authentication for GPR or npm

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
```
<!-- end usage -->

**Basic:**

```yaml
```

The `node-version` input is optional. If not supplied, the node version from PATH will be used. However, it is recommended to always specify Node.js version and don\'t rely on the system one.

The action will first check the local cache for a semver match. If unable to find a specific version in the cache, the action will attempt to download a version of Node.js. It will pull LTS versions from [node-versions releases](https://github.com/actions/node-versions/releases) and on miss or failure will fall back to the previous behavior of downloading directly from [node dist](https://nodejs.org/dist/).

For information regarding locally cached versions of Node.js on GitHub hosted runners, check out [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).

### Supported version syntax

The `node-version` input supports the Semantic Versioning Specification, for more detailed examples please refer to [the semver package documentation](https://github.com/npm/node-semver).

Examples:

 - Major versions: `14`, `16`, `18`
 - More specific versions: `10.15`, `16.15.1` , `18.4.0`
 - NVM LTS syntax: `lts/erbium`, `lts/fermium`, `lts/*`, `lts/-n`
 - Latest release: `*` or `latest`/`current`/`node`

**Note:** Like the other values, `*` will get the latest [locally-cached Node.js version](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md#nodejs), or the latest version from [actions/node-versions](https://github.com/actions/node-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json), depending on the [`check-latest`](docs/advanced-usage.md#check-latest-version) input.

`current`/`latest`/`node` always resolve to the latest [dist version](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json).
That version is then downloaded from actions/node-versions if possible, or directly from Node.js if not.
Since it will not be cached always, there is possibility of hitting rate limit when downloading from dist

### Checking in lockfiles

It\'s **always** recommended to commit the lockfile of your package manager for security and performance reasons. For more information consult the ""Working with lockfiles"" section of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md#working-with-lockfiles) guide.

## Caching global packages data

The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) under the hood for caching global packages data but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` (v6.10+). The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.

The action defaults to search for the dependency file (`package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `yarn.lock`) in the repository root, and uses its hash as a part of the cache key. Use `cache-dependency-path` for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.

**Note:** The action does not cache `node_modules`

See the examples of using cache for `yarn`/`pnpm` and `cache-dependency-path` input in the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-data) guide.

**Caching npm dependencies:**

```yaml
```

**Caching npm dependencies in monorepos:**

```yaml
```

## Matrix Testing

```yaml
```

## Using `setup-node` on GHES

`setup-node` comes pre-installed on the appliance with GHES if Actions is enabled. When dynamically downloading Nodejs distributions, `setup-node` downloads distributions from [`actions/node-versions`](https://github.com/actions/node-versions) on github.com (outside of the appliance). These calls to `actions/node-versions` are made via unauthenticated requests, which are limited to [60 requests per hour per IP](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If more requests are made within the time frame, then you will start to see rate-limit errors during downloading that looks like: `##[error]API rate limit exceeded for...`. After that error the action will try to download versions directly from the official site, but it also can have rate limit so it\'s better to put token.

To get a higher rate limit, you can [generate a personal access token on github.com](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and pass it as the `token` input for the action:

```yaml
```

If the runner is not able to access github.com, any Nodejs versions requested during a workflow run must come from the runner\'s tool cache. See ""[Setting up the tool cache on self-hosted runners without internet access](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)"" for more information.

## Tips

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Caching Hugo Modules

Insert a cache step before site-building as follows.
Note that the cache dir location of Hugo on a Linux-based operating system is `/tmp/hugo_cache`. On macOS, `${TMPDIR}/hugo_cache` has the location.

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Read Hugo version from file

How to sync a Hugo version between a Docker Compose and a GitHub Actions workflow via `.env` file.

Write a `HUGO_VERSION` to the `.env` file like the following and push it to a remote branch.

```sh
```

Next, add a step to read a Hugo version from the `.env` file.

```yaml
```

Here is a `docker-compose.yml` example.

```yaml
```

The alpine base Hugo Docker image is provided on the following repository.

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Workflow for autoprefixer and postcss-cli

Here is an example workflow for the [google/docsy] Hugo theme.
This theme needs `autoprefixer` and `postcss-cli` to build a project.
The following workflow is tested with [google/docsy-example].

[google/docsy]: https://github.com/google/docsy
[google/docsy-example]: https://github.com/google/docsy-example

A workflow for the Hugo Babel pipeline is also the same as follows.

```yaml
```

[![Basic validation](https://github.com/actions/stale/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/stale/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml)
[![e2e tests](https://github.com/actions/stale/actions/workflows/e2e-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/stale/actions/workflows/e2e-tests.yml)

Warns and then closes issues and PRs that have had no activity for a specified amount of time.

The configuration must be on the default branch and the default values will:

- Add a label ""Stale"" on issues and pull requests after 60 days of inactivity and comment on them
- Close the stale issues and pull requests after 7 days of inactivity
- If an update/comment occur on stale issues or pull requests, the stale label will be removed and the timer will restart

## Recommended permissions

For the execution of this action, it must be able to fetch all issues and pull requests from your repository.  
In addition, based on the provided configuration, the action could require more permission(s) (e.g.: add label, remove label, comment, close, delete branch, etc.).  
This can be achieved with the following [configuration in the action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) if the permissions are restricted:

```yaml
```

You can find more information about the required permissions under the corresponding options that you wish to use.

## Statefulness

If the action ends because of [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run) then the next run will start from the first
unprocessed issue skipping the issues proceeded during the previous run(s). The state is reset when all the issues are
proceeded. This should be considered for scheduling workflow runs.

The saved state lifetime is the same as the
[actions cache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy)
configured for the repo.

### Detailed options

#### repo-token

Personal Access Token (PAT) that allows the stale workflow to authenticate and perform API calls to GitHub.  
Under the hood, it uses the [@actions/github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/github) package.

Default value: `${{ github.token }}`

#### days-before-stale

The idle number of days before marking the issues or the pull requests as stale (by adding a label).  
The issues or the pull requests will be marked as stale if the last update (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) is older than the idle number of days.  
It means that any updates made, or any comments added to the issues or to the pull requests will restart the counter of days before marking as stale.  
However, if you wish to ignore this behaviour so that the creation date (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `created_at`) only matters, you can disable the [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) option.

If set to a negative number like `-1`, no issues or pull requests will be marked as stale automatically.  
In that case, you can still add the stale label manually to mark as stale.

The label used to stale is defined by these two options:

- [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label)
- [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label)

A comment can also be added to notify about the stale and is defined by these two options:

- [stale-issue-message](#stale-issue-message)
- [stale-pr-message](#stale-pr-message)

You can fine tune which issues or pull requests should be marked as stale based on the milestones, the assignees, the creation date and the missing/present labels from these options:

- [exempt-issue-labels](#exempt-issue-labels)
- [exempt-pr-labels](#exempt-pr-labels)
- [only-labels](#only-labels)
- [any-of-labels](#any-of-labels)
- [start-date](#start-date)
- [exempt-milestones](#exempt-milestones)
- [exempt-all-milestones](#exempt-all-milestones)
- [exempt-assignees](#exempt-assignees)
- [exempt-all-assignees](#exempt-all-assignees)
- [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates)

Default value: `60`

#### days-before-issue-stale

Useful to override [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) but only for the idle number of days before marking the issues as stale.

Default value: unset

#### days-before-pr-stale

Useful to override [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) but only for the idle number of days before marking the pull requests as stale.

Default value: unset

#### days-before-close

The idle number of days before closing the stale issues or the stale pull requests (due to the stale label).  
The issues or the pull requests will be closed if the last update (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) is older than the idle number of days.  
Since adding the stale label will alter the last update date, we can calculate the number of days from this date.

If set to a negative number like `-1`, the issues or the pull requests will never be closed automatically.

The label used to stale is defined by these two options:

- [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label)
- [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label)

Default value: `7`

#### days-before-issue-close

#### operations-per-run

_Context:_  
This action performs some API calls to GitHub to fetch or close issues and pull requests, set or update labels, add comments, delete branches, etc.  
These operations are made in a very short period of time \xe2\x80\x94 because the action is very fast to run \xe2\x80\x94 and can be numerous based on your project action configuration and the quantity of issues and pull requests within it.  
GitHub has a [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) and if reached will block these API calls for one hour (or API calls from other actions using the same user (a.k.a.: the github-token from the [repo-token](#repo-token) option)).  
This option helps you to stay within the GitHub rate limits, as you can use this option to limit the number of operations for a single run.

_Purpose:_  
This option aims to limit the number of operations made with the GitHub API to avoid reaching the [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting).

Based on your project, your GitHub business plan and the date of the cron job you set for this action, you can increase this limit to a higher number.
If you are not sure which is the right value for you or if the default value is good enough, you could enable the logs and look at the end of the stale action.  
If you reached the limit, you will see a warning message in the logs, telling you that you should increase the number of operations.
If you choose not to increase the limit, you might end up with unprocessed issues or pull requests after a stale action run.

When [debugging](#Debugging), you can set it to a much higher number like `1000` since there will be fewer operations made with the GitHub API.  
Only the [actor](#repo-token) and the batch of issues (100 per batch) will consume the operations.

Default value: `30`

#### remove-stale-when-updated

Automatically remove the stale label when the issues or the pull requests are updated (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) or commented.

Default value: `true`  
Required Permission: `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write`

#### remove-issue-stale-when-updated

Override [remove-stale-when-updated](#remove-stale-when-updated) but only to automatically remove the stale label when the issues are updated (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) or commented.

Default value: unset  
Required Permission: `issues: write`

#### remove-pr-stale-when-updated

Default value: unset

#### labels-to-remove-when-stale

A comma delimited list of labels to remove when an issue or pull request becomes stale and has the [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label) or [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label) added to it.

Warning: each label results in a unique API call which can drastically consume the limit of [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run).

Default value: unset  
Required Permission: `pull-requests: write`

#### labels-to-remove-when-unstale

A comma delimited list of labels to remove when a stale issue or pull request receives activity and has the [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label) or [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label) removed from it.

Default value: `false`

#### ascending

Change the order used to fetch the issues and pull requests from GitHub:

- `true` is for ascending.
- `false` is for descending.

It can be useful if your repository is processing so many issues and pull requests that you reach the [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run) limit.  
Based on the order, you could prefer to focus on the new content or on the old content of your repository.

Default value: `false`

#### start-date

The start date is used to ignore the issues and pull requests created before the start date.  
Particularly useful when you wish to add this stale workflow on an existing repository and only wish to stale the new issues and pull requests.

If set, the date must be formatted following the `ISO 8601` or `RFC 2822` standard.

Default value: unset

#### delete-branch

If set to `true`, the stale workflow will automatically delete the GitHub branches related to the pull requests automatically closed by the stale workflow.

Required Permission: `pull-requests: write` and `contents: write`

#### exempt-milestones

A white-list of milestone(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that does not contain one of these milestone(s).

#### exempt-all-pr-milestones

Override [exempt-all-milestones](#exempt-all-milestones) but only to exempt the pull requests with a milestone to be marked as stale automatically.

Default value: unset

#### exempt-assignees

An allow-list of assignee(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that does not contain one of these assignee(s).

#### exempt-draft-pr

If set to `true`, the pull requests currently in draft will not be marked as stale automatically.  
\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This option consume one operation per pull request to process because we need to fetch the pull request with the GitHub API to know if it\'s a draft one or not.

Default value: `false`  
Required Permission: `pull-requests: read`

#### enable-statistics

Collects and display statistics at the end of the stale workflow logs to get a summary of what happened during the run.  
This option is only useful if the debug output secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set to `true` in your repository to display the logs.

Default value: `true`

#### ignore-updates

The option [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) will define the number of days before considering the issues or the pull requests as stale.  
In most cases, the purpose of this action is to only stale when necessary so if any update occurs or if a comment is added to them, the counter will restart.  
Nonetheless, if you don\'t care about this, and you prefer to stick to this number of days no matter the update, you can enable this option.  
Instead of comparing the number of days based on the [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`, it will be based on the [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `created_at`.

Default value: `false`

#### ignore-issue-updates

Useful to override [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) but only to ignore the updates for the issues.

Useful to override [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) but only to ignore the updates for the pull requests.

Default value: unset

#### include-only-assigned

If set to `true`, only the issues or the pull requests with an assignee will be marked as stale automatically.

Default value: `false`

### Usage

See also [action.yml](./action.yml) for a comprehensive list of all the options.

Basic:

```yaml
```

Configure stale timeouts:

```yaml
```

Configure different stale timeouts but never close a PR:

```yaml
```

Configure different stale timeouts:

```yaml
```

Configure labels:

```yaml
```

Configure the stale action to only stale issue/PR created after the 18th april 2020:

```yaml
```

Avoid stale for specific milestones:

```yaml
```

Avoid stale for all PR with milestones:

```yaml
```

Check stale for specific labels:

```yaml
```

Avoid stale for specific assignees:

```yaml
```

Avoid stale for all PR with assignees:

```yaml
```

### Debugging

**Logs:**  
To see the debug output from this action, you must set the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true` in your repository.  
There are many logs, so this can be very helpful!

**Statistics:**  
If the logs are enabled, you can also enable the statistics log which will be visible at the end of the logs once all issues were processed.  
This is very helpful to have a quick understanding of the whole stale workflow.  
Set `enable-statistics` to `true` in your workflow configuration file.

**Dry-run:**  
You can run this action in debug only mode (no actions will be taken on your issues and pull requests) by passing `debug-only` to `true` as an argument to the action.

**More operations:**  
You can increase the maximum number of operations per run by passing `operations-per-run` to `1000` for example which will help you to handle more operations in a single stale workflow run.  
If the `debug-only` option is enabled, this is very helpful because the workflow will (almost) never reach the GitHub API rate, and you will be able to deep-dive into the logs.

**Job frequency:**  
You could change the cron job frequency in the stale workflow to run the stale workflow more often.  
Usually, this is not very helpful though.

# Slack messages for GitHub Actions workflows, jobs and steps

A simple and flexible Slack integration with GitHub Actions.

<img src=""./docs/images/example1.png"" width=""540"" title=""Slack Example #1"">

## Features

* Advanced users can use a [configuration file](#config-optional) and Handlebars templates to configure every aspect of the Slack message.

* In addition to ""legacy"" attachments, rich messages can be created using [layout blocks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts) for flexible message visualisation and interactivity.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`env`)

#### `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (required)

Create a Slack Webhook URL using either the
[Incoming Webhooks App](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks?next_id=0)
(preferred) or by attaching an incoming webhook to an existing
[Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) (beware, channel override not possible
when using a Slack App):

    env:
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

### Input Parameters (`with`)

#### `webhook-url` (optional)

Only required if the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable is not set.

      with:
        webhook-url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

#### `status` (required)

The `status` must be defined. It can either be the current job status
using:

      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}

or a hardcoded custom status such as ""starting"" or ""in progress"":

      with:
        status: in progress

#### `steps` (optional)

The individual status of job steps can be included in the Slack
message using:

      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        steps: ${{ toJson(steps) }}

**Note: Only steps that have a ""step id"" will be reported on. See example below.**

#### `channel` (optional)

To override the channel or to send the Slack message to an individual
use:

      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        channel: \'#workflows\'

**Note: To override the channel the Slack webhook URL must be an
Incoming Webhook URL. See https://api.slack.com/faq#incoming_webhooks**

### `message` (optional)

To override the slack message use:

      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        channel: \'#workflows\'
        message: Deploying {{ env.GITHUB_REF_NAME }} branch

### `config` (optional)

A configuration file can be used to customise the following Slack message fields:

  - `username`
  - `icon_url`
  - `pretext`
  - `title` and `title_link`
  - `text`
  - `fallback` plain text summary used for dumb clients and notifications
  - `fields` title, value and short/long
  - `blocks` including `actions`, `context`, `divider`, `file`,  `header`, `image`, `input` and `section` blocks
  - message `footer`
  - border `colors` based job status `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`. valid colors are `good` (green), `warning` (yellow), `danger` (red) or any hex color code eg. `#439FE0`
  - `icons` for step status `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, and a default

Default: `.github/slack.yml`

      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        config: .github/config/slack.yml

The following Slack [message fields](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments) and
[block layouts](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) support templating using
[Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) format:

- `pretext`
- `title`
- `text` and `message`
- `fallback`
- `fields` `title` and `value`
- `blocks`

**Supported Template variables**

`env.*`, `payload.*`, `jobName`, `jobStatus`, `jobSteps`,
`eventName`, `workflow`, `workflowUrl`, `workflowRunUrl`, `repositoryName`, `repositoryUrl`, `runId`, `runNumber`, `sha`, `shortSha`, `branch`, `actor`, `action`, `ref`, `refType`, `refUrl`, `diffRef`, `diffUrl`, `description`, `sender`

**Helper Functions**

Apart from the [standard helper functions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#if) such as `#if` and `#each` there are also a few custom
ones:

- `icon` converts a job status into an icon eg. `{{icon jobStatus}}`
- `json` dumps the value as a JSON string eg. `{{json payload.commits}}`
- `truncate` cuts the string at the limit eg. `{{truncate sha 8}}`
- `default` allows a alternative or default value eg. `{{default headRef ""master""}}`
- `pluralize` outputs different text based on item count eg. `{{pluralize requested_reviewers ""reviewer"" ""reviewers""}}` (if only singular form is given plural is derived by adding an ""s"")

- `eq`, `neq`, `not`, `and`, and `or` can be used as logical operators eg. `{{#if (and (not has_issues) (or has_pages has_wiki))}}yes{{else}}no{{/if}}`
- `#ifeq` and `#ifneq` test for variable equality or not eg. `{{#ifneq event_name ""create""}}yes{{else}}no{{/ifneq}}`

**Example Using Config File**

To generate the message format below use the `slack.yml` configuration file that follows.

<img src=""./docs/images/example3.png"" width=""540"" title=""Slack Example #1"">

*Example Configuration File: slack.yml*

```
```

*Notes:*

* If template expressions occur at the start of a string the string must be double-quoted eg. `pretext: ""{{eventName}} triggered by {{actor}}""`
* Use [YAML multiline string formats](https://yaml-multiline.info/) `|`, `>`, `|-` and `>-` or double-quotes `""\
""` to control new lines
* Use `~` (tilde) character to control whitepace when looping see [Whitespace control](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#whitespace-control)

### Conditionals (`if`)

To ensure the Slack message is sent even if the job fails add the
`always()` function:

    if: always()

or use a specific status function to only run when the job status
matches. All possible status check functions are:

* `success()` (default)
* `always()`
* `cancelled()`
* `failure()`

## Examples

To send a Slack message when a workflow job has completed add the
following as the last step of the job:

    - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
      with: 
        status: ${{ job.status }}
      if: always()

To include statuses for each Job Step in the message include the
`steps` input (making sure to use the `toJSON` function):

    - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
      with: 
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        steps: ${{ toJson(steps) }}
      if: always()

Only steps that have a ""step id"" assigned to them will be reported on:

    - name: Build
      id: build
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build

The default Slack channel for the configured webhook can be overridden
using either another channel name `#channel` or a username `@username`.

    - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
      with: 
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        channel: \'#workflows\'

or

    - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
      with: 
        status: ${{ job.status }}
        channel: \'@nick\'

### Complete example

    name: Docker Build and Push

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master, release/* ]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          REPOSITORY_URL: docker.pkg.github.com
          IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}/alerta-cli
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
        steps:
          - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
            with:
              status: starting
              channel: \'#workflows\'
              message: Starting Docker Build and Push...
            if: always()
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Variables
            id: vars
            run: echo ""::set-output name=SHORT_COMMIT_ID::$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)""
          - name: Build image
            id: docker-build
            run: >-
              docker build
              -t $IMAGE_NAME
              -t $REPOSITORY_URL/$IMAGE_NAME:${{ steps.vars.outputs.SHORT_COMMIT_ID }}
              -t $REPOSITORY_URL/$IMAGE_NAME:latest .
          - name: Docker Login
            env:
              DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
              DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            run: docker login $REPOSITORY_URL --username ""$DOCKER_USERNAME"" --password ""$DOCKER_PASSWORD""
          - name: Publish Image
            id: docker-push
            run: docker push $REPOSITORY_URL/$IMAGE_NAME

          - uses: act10ns/slack@v1
            with:
              status: ${{ job.status }}
              steps: ${{ toJson(steps) }}
              channel: \'#workflows\'
            if: always()

The above ""Docker Build and Push"" workflow will appear in Slack as:

## Troubleshooting

To enable runner diagnostic logging set the `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` secret to `true`.

To enable step debug logging set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true`.

42,"# Octokit Request Action

> A GitHub Action to send queries to GitHub\'s GraphQL API

[![Build Status](https://github.com/octokit/graphql-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octokit/graphql-action/actions)

## Usage

Minimal example

```yml
```

You can also use the `variables` parameter to pass variables.

```yml
```

To access deep values of `outputs.data`, use [`fromJSON()`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson).

## Debugging

To see additional debug logs, create a secret with the name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and value `true`.

## How it works

`octokit/graphql-action` is using [`@octokit/graphql`](https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js/) internally with the addition
that requests are automatically authenticated using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. It is required to prevent rate limiting, as all anonymous requests from the same origin count against the same low rate.

The actions sets `data` output to the response data. Note that it is a string, you should use [`fromJSON()`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson) to access any value of the response. The action also sets `headers` (again, to a JSON string) and `status`.

## Preview Media Types

New features of graphql require the use of an Accept header with a preview media-type.
This is supported with a `mediaType` property, e.g.

```yml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Input variables

It\'s important to remark `input variables` are converted to lowercase at runtime. This happens with GitHub Actions by design[^1].

### Example

In the following example, the variable `itemId` is casted to `itemid` so, when trying to use it in the `query`, the execution will fail because of a missing variable: `itemId`

```graphql
```

The recommendation[^1] is to use variables in lowercase to avoid this kind of problems:

```graphql
```

## Getting Started :airplane:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn\'t already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work. If you intend to make multiple deployments in quick succession [you may need to leverage the concurrency parameter in your workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency) to prevent overlaps.

You can view an example of this below.

```yml
```

If you\'d like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.

```yml
```

> **Warning**
> If you do not supply the action with an access token or an SSH key, you must access your repositories settings and provide `Read and Write Permissions` to the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`, otherwise you\'ll potentially run into permission issues. Alternatively you can set the following in your workflow file to grant the action the permissions it needs.

```yml
```

## Configuration \xf0\x9f\x93\x81

The `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repository\'s `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).

#### Required Setup

The following options must be configured in order to make a deployment.

| Key      | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Type   | Required |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `folder` | The folder in your repository that you want to deploy. If your build script compiles into a directory named `build` you\'d put it here. If you wish to deploy the root directory you can place a `.` here. You can also utilize absolute file paths by prepending `~` to your folder path. | `with` | **Yes**  |

By default, the action does not need any token configuration and uses the provided repository scoped GitHub token to make the deployment. If you require more customization you can modify the deployment type using the following options.

| Key       | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Type   | Required |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `token`   | This option defaults to the repository scoped GitHub Token. However, if you need more permissions for things such as deploying to another repository, you can add a Personal Access Token (PAT) here. This should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary and recommend when generating a new PAT that you select the least permission scopes necessary. [Learn more about creating and using encrypted secrets here.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) | `with` | **No**   |
| `ssh-key` | You can configure the action to deploy using SSH by setting this option to a private SSH key stored **as a secret**. It can also be set to `true` to use an existing SSH client configuration. For more detailed information on how to add your public/private ssh key pair please refer to the [Using a Deploy Key section of this README](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action/tree/dev#using-an-ssh-deploy-key-).                                                                                                                                                                                                | `with` | **No**   |

| Key                | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Type   | Required |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `branch`           | This is the branch you wish to deploy to, for example, `gh-pages` or `docs`. Defaults to `gh-pages`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `with` | **No**   |
| `git-config-name`  | Allows you to customize the name that is attached to the git config which is used when pushing the deployment commits. If this is not included it will use the name in the GitHub context, followed by the name of the action.                                                                                                                                              | `with` | **No**   |
| `git-config-email` | Allows you to customize the email that is attached to the git config which is used when pushing the deployment commits. If this is not included it will use the email in the GitHub context, followed by a generic noreply GitHub email. You can include `<>` for the value if you wish to omit this field altogether and push the commits without an email.                | `with` | **No**   |
| `repository-name`  | Allows you to specify a different repository path so long as you have permissions to push to it. This should be formatted like so: `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`. You\'ll need to use a PAT in the `token` input for this configuration option to work properly.                                                                                                    | `with` | **No**   |
| `target-folder`    | If you\'d like to push the contents of the deployment folder into a specific directory on the deployment branch you can specify it here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `with` | **No**   |
| `commit-message`   | If you need to customize the commit message for an integration you can do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `with` | **No**   |
| `clean`            | You can use this option to delete files from your deployment destination that no longer exist in your deployment source. One use case is if your project generates hashed files that vary from build to build. Using `clean` will not affect `.git`, `.github`, or `.ssh` directories. This option is turned on by default and can be toggled off by setting it to `false`. | `with` | **No**   |
| `clean-exclude`    | If you need to use `clean` but you\'d like to preserve certain files or folders you can use this option. This should contain each pattern as a single line in a multiline string.                                                                                                                                                                                            | `with` | **No**   |
| `dry-run`          | Do not actually push back, but use `--dry-run` on `git push` invocations instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |
| `single-commit`    | This option can be toggled to `true` if you\'d prefer to have a single commit on the deployment branch instead of maintaining the full history. **Using this option will also cause any existing history to be wiped from the deployment branch**.                                                                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |
| `force`            | Force-push new deployments to overwrite the previous version; otherwise, attempt to rebase new deployments onto any existing ones. This option is turned on by default and can be toggled off by setting it to `false`, which may be useful if there are multiple deployments in a single branch.                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |
| `silent`           | Silences the action output preventing it from displaying git messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `with` | **No**   |
| `tag`              | Add a tag to the commit. Only works when `dry-run` is not used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `with` | **No**   |

With the action correctly configured you should see the workflow trigger the deployment under the configured conditions.

#### Deployment Status

The action will export an environment variable called `deployment_status` that you can use in your workflow to determine if the deployment was successful or not. You can find an explanation of each status type below.

| Status    | Description                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success` | The `success` status indicates that the action was able to successfully deploy to the branch.   |
| `failed`  | The `failed` status indicates that the action encountered an error while trying to deploy.      |
| `skipped` | The `skipped` status indicates that the action exited early as there was nothing new to deploy. |

This value is also set as a step output as `deployment-status`.

### Using an SSH Deploy Key \xf0\x9f\x94\x91

If you\'d prefer to use an SSH deploy key as opposed to a token you must first generate a new SSH key by running the following terminal command, replacing the email with one connected to your GitHub account.

```bash
```

Once you\'ve generated the key pair you must add the contents of the public key within your repository\'s [deploy keys menu](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/). You can find this option by going to `Settings > Deploy Keys`, you can name the public key whatever you want, but you **do** need to give it write access. Afterwards, add the contents of the private key to the `Settings > Secrets` menu as `DEPLOY_KEY`.

With this configured, you can then set the `ssh-key` part of the action to your private key stored as a secret.

```yml
```

<details><summary>You can view a full example of this here.</summary>
<p>

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
jobs:
  deploy:
    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: build
          clean: true
          clean-exclude: |
            special-file.txt
            some/*.txt
          ssh-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

</p>
</details>

Alternatively, if you\'ve already configured the SSH client within a previous step you can set the `ssh-key` option to `true` to allow it to deploy using an existing SSH client. Instead of adjusting the client configuration, it will simply switch to using GitHub\'s SSH endpoints.

### Operating System Support \xf0\x9f\x92\xbf

This action is primarily developed using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). [In your workflow job configuration](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) it\'s recommended to set the `runs-on` property to `ubuntu-latest`.

```yml
```

If you\'re using an operating system such as [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) you can workaround this using [artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts). In your workflow configuration you can utilize the `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions to move your project built on a Windows job to a secondary job that will handle the deployment.

<details><summary>You can view an example of this pattern here.</summary>
<p>

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest # The first job utilizes windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      - name: Upload Artifacts \xf0\x9f\x94\xba # The project is then uploaded as an artifact named \'site\'.
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: site
          path: build

  deploy:
    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}
    needs: [build] # The second job must depend on the first one to complete before running and uses ubuntu-latest instead of windows.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Download Artifacts \xf0\x9f\x94\xbb # The built project is downloaded into the \'site\' folder.
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: site

      - name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: \'site\' # The deployment folder should match the name of the artifact. Even though our project builds into the \'build\' folder the artifact name of \'site\' must be placed here.
```

### Using a Container \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa2

If you use a [container](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) in your workflow you may need to run an additional step to install `rsync` as this action depends on it. You can view an example of this below.

```yml
```

---

### Additional Build Files \xf0\x9f\x93\x81

If you\'re using a custom domain and require a `CNAME` file, or if you require the use of a `.nojekyll` file, you can safely commit these files directly into the deployment branch without them being overridden after each deployment, additionally, you can include these files in your deployment folder to update them. If you need to add additional files to the deployment that should be ignored by the build clean-up steps you can utilize the `clean-exclude` option.

        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: build
          clean: true
          clean-exclude: |
            special-file.txt
            some/*.txt
```

</p>
</details>

If you wish to remove these files you must go into the deployment branch directly to remove them. This is to prevent accidental changes in your deployment script from creating breaking changes.

This action sets up a go environment for use in actions by:

- Optionally downloading and caching a version of Go by version and adding to `PATH`.
- Registering problem matchers for error output.

# V4

The V4 edition of the action offers:

 - Enabled caching by default

The action will try to enable caching unless the `cache` input is explicitly set to false.

Please see ""[Caching dependency files and build outputs](https://github.com/actions/setup-go#caching-dependency-files-and-build-outputs)"" for more information.

# V3

The V3 edition of the action offers:

- Adds `GOBIN` to the `PATH`
- Proxy support
- Check latest version
- Caching packages dependencies
- stable and oldstable aliases
- Bug Fixes (including issues around version matching and semver)

The action will first check the local cache for a version match. If a version is not found locally, it will pull it from
the `main` branch of the [go-versions](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json)
repository. On miss or failure, it will fall back to downloading directly
from [go dist](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang). To change the default behavior, please use
the [check-latest input](#check-latest-version).

**Note:** The `setup-go` action uses executable binaries which are built by Golang side. The action does not build
golang from source code.

Matching by [semver spec](https://github.com/npm/node-semver):

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

> **Note**: Due to the peculiarities of YAML parsing, it is recommended to wrap the version in single quotation marks:
> 
> ```yaml
>   go-version: \'1.20\'
>  ```
>  
> The recommendation is based on the YAML parser\'s behavior, which interprets non-wrapped values as numbers and, in the case of version 1.20, trims it down to 1.2, which may not be very obvious.
Matching an unstable pre-release:

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic

```yaml
```

## Check latest version

The `check-latest` flag defaults to `false`. Use the default or set `check-latest` to `false` if you prefer stability
and if you want to ensure a specific Go version is always used.

If `check-latest` is set to `true`, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally
cached version is not the most up-to-date, a Go version will then be downloaded. Set `check-latest` to `true` if you
want the most up-to-date Go version to always be used.

> Setting `check-latest` to `true` has performance implications as downloading Go versions is slower than using cached
> versions.

```yaml
```

## Using stable/oldstable aliases

If `stable` is provided, action will get the latest stable version from
the [`go-versions`](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json) repository manifest.

If `oldstable` is provided, when current release is 1.19.x, action will resolve version as 1.18.x, where x is the latest
patch release.

**Note:** using these aliases will result in same version as using corresponding minor release with `check-latest` input
set to `true`

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

## Caching dependency files and build outputs:

The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring go modules and build outputs. It
uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood but requires less configuration settings.
The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned on by default.

The action defaults to search for the dependency file - go.sum in the repository root, and uses its hash as a part of
the cache key. Use `cache-dependency-path` input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located
in different subdirectories.

If some problem that prevents success caching happens then the action issues the warning in the log and continues the execution of the pipeline. 

**Caching in monorepos**

```yaml
  ```

## Getting go version from the go.mod file

The `go-version-file` input accepts a path to a `go.mod` file or a `go.work` file that contains the version of Go to be
used by a project. As the `go.mod` file contains only major and minor (e.g. 1.18) tags, the action will search for the
latest available patch version sequentially in the runner\'s directory with the cached tools, in
the [versions-manifest.json](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json) file or at the go
servers.

If both the `go-version` and the `go-version-file` inputs are provided then the `go-version` input is used.
> The action will search for the `go.mod` file relative to the repository root

```yaml
```

## Matrix testing

```yaml
```

### Supported version syntax

The `go-version` input supports the following syntax:

- Specific versions: `1.15`, `1.16.1`, `1.17.0-rc.2`, `1.16.0-beta.1`
- SemVer\'s version range syntax: `^1.13.1`, `>=1.18.0-rc.1`

For more information about semantic versioning, please refer to [semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver)
documentation.

## Using `setup-go` on GHES

`setup-go` comes pre-installed on the appliance with GHES if Actions is enabled. When dynamically downloading Go
distributions, `setup-go` downloads distributions from [`actions/go-versions`](https://github.com/actions/go-versions)
on github.com (outside of the appliance). These calls to `actions/go-versions` are made via unauthenticated requests,
which are limited
to [60 requests per hour per IP](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If
more requests are made within the time frame, then you will start to see rate-limit errors during downloading that looks
like: `##[error]API rate limit exceeded for...`. After that error the action will try to download versions directly
from https://storage.googleapis.com/golang, but it also can have rate limit so it\'s better to put token.

To get a higher rate limit, you
can [generate a personal access token on github.com](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and pass it as the `token`
input for the action:

```yaml
```

If the runner is not able to access github.com, any Go versions requested during a workflow run must come from the
runner\'s tool cache.
See ""[Setting up the tool cache on self-hosted runners without internet access](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)""

# Coveralls GitHub Action

This GitHub Action posts your test suite\'s LCOV coverage data to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) for analysis, change tracking, and notifications. You don\'t need to add the repo to Coveralls first, it will be created when receiving the post.

When running on `pull_request` events, a comment will be added to the PR with details about how coverage will be affected if merged.

## Usage

The action\'s step needs to run after your test suite has outputted an LCOV file. Most major test runners can be configured to do so; if you\'re using Node, see more info [here](https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls).

### Inputs:

| Name                  | Requirement | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `github-token`        | _required_ | Default if not specified: `${{ github.token }}`. Can be also specified this way: `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`; Coveralls uses this token to verify the appropriate repo at Coveralls and send any new status updates based on your coverage results. This variable is built into Github Actions, so __do not add it to your secrets store__. [More Info](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token)|
| `file`        | _optional_ | Default: all coverage files that could be found. Local path to the coverage report file produced by your test suite. An error will be thrown if no file was found. This is the file that will be sent to the Coveralls API. Leave empty if you want to combine many files reports. |
| `files`       | _optional_ | Default: all coverage files that could be found. Space-separated list of coverage report files produced by your test suite. Example: `files: coverage/test1.lcov coverage/test2.lcov` |
| `format`              | _optional_ | Force coverage report file format. If not specified, coveralls will try to detect the format based on file extension and/or content. Possible values: `lcov`, `simplecov`, `cobertura`, `jacoco`, `gcov`, `golang`, `python`. See also [actual supported coverage report formats list](https://github.com/coverallsapp/coverage-reporter#supported-coverage-report-formats). |
| `flag-name`           | _optional (unique required if parallel)_ | Job flag name, e.g. ""Unit"", ""Functional"", or ""Integration"". Will be shown in the Coveralls UI. |
| `parallel`            | _optional_ | Set to true for parallel (or matrix) based steps, where multiple posts to Coveralls will be performed in the check. `flag-name` needs to be set and unique, e.g. `flag-name: run ${{ join(matrix.*, \' - \') }}` |
| `parallel-finished`   | _optional_ | Set to true in the last job, after the other parallel jobs steps have completed, this will send a webhook to Coveralls to set the build complete. |
| `carryforward`        | _optional_ | Comma separated flags used to carryforward results from previous builds if some of the parallel jobs are missing. Used only with `parallel-finished`. |
| `coveralls-endpoint`  | _optional_ | Hostname and protocol: `https://<host>`; Specifies a [Coveralls Enterprise](https://enterprise.coveralls.io/) hostname. |
| `allow-empty`         | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Don\'t fail if coverage report is empty or contains no coverage data. |
| `base-path`           | _optional_ | Path to the root folder of the project the coverage was collected in. Should be used in monorepos so that coveralls can process the LCOV correctly (e.g. packages/my-project) |
| `git-branch`          | _optional_ | Default: GITHUB_REF environment variable. Override the branch name. |
| `git-commit`          | _optional_ | Default: GITHUB_SHA environment variable. Override the commit SHA. |
| `compare-ref`         | _optional_ | Branch name to compare coverage with. Specify if you want to always check coverage change for PRs against one branch. |
| `compare-sha`         | _optional_ | Commit SHA to compare coverage with. |
| `debug`               | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to enable debug logging. |
| `measure`             | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to enable time time measurement logging. |
| `fail-on-error`       | _optional_ | Default: `true`. Set to `false` to avoid CI failure when upload fails due to any errors. |

### Outputs:

* `coveralls-api-result`: JSON response from the Coveralls API with a status code and url for the Job on Coveralls.

### Standard Example:

* This example assumes you\'re building a Node project using the command `make test-coverage`, demo here: [nickmerwin/node-coveralls](https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls)

```yaml
```

### Complete Parallel Job Example:

```yaml
```

The ""Coveralls Finished"" step needs to run after all other steps have completed; it will let Coveralls know that all jobs in the build are done and aggregate coverage calculation can be calculated and notifications sent.

## Demo

![demo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coveralls.io/Coveralls%20Github%20Action%20Demo%20-%20trimmed%20-%204.8x720.gif)

### Steps shown:

1. A new function `f` without test coverage is added.
2. The changes are committed and pushed to a new branch ""function/f""
3. The workflow runs on GitHub Actions.
4. The commit on GitHub shows a new check for Coveralls with details ""First build on function-f at 92.0%"", and links to the Job on Coveralls.
5. Line-by-line results indicate the new function is missing coverage.
6. Create a pull request with the new branch.
7. The `pull_request` check runs and the resulting coverage data triggers a `fail` status.
8. A detailed comment is posted.

## Troubleshooting:

### Coveralls comments aren\'t added to my pull request

Ensure that:

1. Your workflow invokes the Coveralls action runs on pull requests, e.g.:

```yaml
```

2. You have invited the [@coveralls](https://github.com/coveralls) user to your repository with `Role: Write`
3. You have enabled the ""LEAVE COMMENTS?"" setting in the ""Pull Request Alerts"" area in your Repo Settings page inside the Coveralls app.

### Coveralls responds with ""cannot find matching repository""

Ensure your workflow yaml line for the GitHub token matches *exactly*:

```yaml
```

> **Note**
> If you are a Ruby developer using [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov), other users have recommended installing an additional gem \xe2\x80\x93 `gem ""simplecov_json_formatter""` \xe2\x80\x93 this gem fixes `json` error from the default `coverage/.resultset.json` output from SimpleCov.

#### Example

```yaml
```

#### Example with only upload

When you\'ve already generated the coverage report in a previous step and wish to just upload the coverage data to Code Climate, you can leave out the `coverageCommand` option.

```yaml
```

#### Example with wildcard (glob) pattern

This action supports basic glob patterns to search for files matching given patterns. It uses [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob#basic) to expand the glob patterns.

```yaml
    with:
      coverageCommand: yarn run coverage
      coverageLocations: |
        ${{github.workspace}}/*.lcov:lcov
```

#### Example with Jacoco

```yaml
```

#### Example of multiple test coverages for monorepo with Jest

Let\'s say you have a monorepo with two folders \xe2\x80\x94`client` and `server`, both with their own coverage folders and a `yarn coverage` script which runs Jest within both folders.

```json
```

First be sure that paths in your `coverage/lcov.info` are correct; they should be either absolute or relative to the **root** of the monorepo. Open `lcov.info` and search for any path. For example \xe2\x80\x94

```lcov
```

If you find a *relative* path like this (happens for Jest 25+), it\'s incorrect as it is relative to the sub-package. This can be fixed by configuring Jest to set the root of your monorepo \xe2\x80\x94

```javascript
```

```yaml
```

pre-commit/action
=================

a GitHub action to run [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

### using this action

To use this action, make a file `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`.  Here's a
template to get started:

```yaml
```

This does a few things:

- clones the code
- installs python
- sets up the `pre-commit` cache

### using this action with custom invocations

By default, this action runs all the hooks against all the files.  `extra_args`
lets users specify a single hook id and/or options to pass to `pre-commit run`.

Here's a sample step configuration that only runs the `flake8` hook against all
the files (use the template above except for the `pre-commit` action):

```yaml
```

### using this action in private repositories

prior to v3.0.0, this action had custom behaviour which pushed changes back to
the pull request when supplied with a `token`.

this behaviour was removed:
- it required a PAT (didn't work with short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- properly hiding this `input` from the installation and execution of hooks
  is intractable in github actions (it is readily available as `$INPUT_TOKEN`)
- this meant potentially unvetted code could access the token via the
  environment

you can _likely_ achieve the same thing with an external action such as
[git-auto-commit-action] though you may want to take precautions to clear `git`
hooks or other ways that arbitrary code execution can occur when running
`git commit` / `git push` (for example [core.fsmonitor]).

while unrelated to this action, [pre-commit.ci] avoids these problems by
installing and executing isolated from the short-lived repository-scoped
[installation access token].

49,"# PR Labeler

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-3-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

A GitHub Action that automatically applies labels to your PRs based on branch name patterns like `feature/*` or `fix/*`.
Can be used in combination with [Release Drafter](https://github.com/toolmantim/release-drafter) to automatically [categorize pull requests](https://github.com/toolmantim/release-drafter#categorize-pull-requests).

## Usage

Add `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml` with the following:

```yml
```

## Configuration

Configure by creating a `.github/pr-labeler.yml` file.

For example:

```yml
```

Then if a pull request is opened with the branch name `feature/218-add-emoji-support` the Action will automatically apply the `feature` label.

Similarly, if a pull requests is opened with the branch name `fix/weird-bug` or `chore/annual-refactoring-job`, the Action will apply the `fix` or `chore \xf0\x9f\x94\xa8` label, respectively.

If the label does not exist in your repo, a new one will be created (with no color and blank description), but it will not be permanently saved to the `github.com/<your_repo>/labels` page.

### Wildcard branches in configuration

You can use `*` as a wildcard for matching multiple branch names. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/matcher for more information about wildcard options.

### Default configuration

When no configuration is provided, the following defaults will be used:

```yml
```

## Usage

You can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:

```yaml
```

If you\'re unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.

## Configuration

Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository. The configuration file **must** reside in your default branch, no other configurations will be accepted.

### Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:

<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
```

## Configuration Options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

| `$COMPLETE` | The complete version string (including any prerelease info). |

## Version Resolver

With the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

The above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.

If a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.

## References

**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)

References takes an list and accepts strings and regex.
If none are specified, we default to the repository\xe2\x80\x99s default branch usually master.

```yaml
```

Currently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:

<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using the embedded Autolabeler functionality (see below),
[PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

Optionally you can add a `collapse-after` entry to your category item, if the category has more than the defined `collapse-after` pull requests then it will show all pull requests collapsed for that category. Append the `collapse-after` integer to your category as following:

```yml
```

## Exclude Pull Requests

With the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.

## Include Pull Requests

With the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""app-foo"" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.

## Exclude Contributors

By default, the `$CONTRIBUTORS` variable will contain the names or usernames of all the contributors of a release. The `exclude-contributors` option allows you to remove certain usernames from that list. This can be useful if don\'t wish to include yourself, to better highlight only the third-party contributions.

```yml
```

## Replacers

You can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.

```yml
```

## Autolabeler

You can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).
Matchers are evaluated independently; the label will be set if at least one of the matchers meets the criteria.

```yml
```

## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## Action Inputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.

| Input         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `config-name` | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that\'s where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `name`        | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `name-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `tag`         | The tag name to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `tag-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `version`     | The version to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any version calculated by the release-drafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `publish`     | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |
| `prerelease`  | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated is a prerelease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `latest`      | A string indicating whether the release being created or updated should be marked as latest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `commitish`   | A string specifying the target branch for the release being created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `header`      | A string that would be added before the template body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `footer`      | A string that would be added after the template body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Action Outputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action sets a couple of outputs which can be used as inputs to other Actions in the workflow ([example](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset)).

| Output       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | The ID of the release that was created or updated.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `name`       | The name of this release.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `body`       | The body of the drafted release, useful if it needs to be included in files.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `html_url`   | The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`.                                                                                                    |
| `upload_url` | The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset GitHub Action`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset). |

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
```

Once you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Runs test
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub, which triggers GitHub Action that does the following:
    - Push GitHub app to Heroku
    - Releases NPM
    - Publish the Release Draft!

This project was created as temporary solution to problem I saw a lot of people to have but it seems people at github have no intention of fixing and neither do I.
I recommend looking at other projects or you could use this as starting point for your own action.

You could also +1 [this issue](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/290)

or take a look at this comment from the same issue https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/290#issuecomment-1374207010

# Delete artifacts action

Action responsible for deleting old artifacts by setting expire duration.

Hopefuly this is just temporary solution till github implements this functionality natively.

## Inputs
### `expire-in`
**Required** for how long the artifacts should be kept.
Most of the human readable formats are supported `10 minutes`, `1hr 20mins`, `1week`.
Take a look at [parse-duration](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration) for more information.


## Outputs
### `deleted-artifacts`
Serialized list of deleted artifacts. Empty `[]` when nothing is deleted

## Usage

Run this action as cron. This won't delete artifacts of running workflows because they
are persisted after workflow completion.

```yaml
```

## Optional arguments

### `onlyPrefix`

Only purge artifacts that start with `tmp_` as a prefix.

```yaml
```

### `exceptPrefix`

Exclude any artifacts that start with `prod_` as a prefix

```yaml
```

## Note

If you reach size limit, you can temporarily change to `on: push` and run it immediately.
Even if the action succeeded, it will take a few more minutes for the artifacts to actually disappear.

## Contributing

I would take a look at other maintained projects and contribute to them.

52,"# MinVer for GitHub Actions

_[![Build status](https://github.com/thefringeninja/action-minver/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thefringeninja/action-minver/actions)_

This repository contains a GitHub Action to run [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver/). This is intended to be used for projects written in languages other than dotnet. See https://github.com/adamralph/minver/#usage for more information about MinVer.

## Configuration

```yaml
```

## Outputs
- `version`

## Prerequisites

You must run the following actions first:
- `actions/checkout`: in addition, set `fetch-depth` to 0 to fetch the entire repository, including tags. Without this, the correct version may not get calculated.


## Example

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Upload a Release Asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to upload release assets.

<a href=""https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset/workflows/Tests/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file). You also will need to have a release to upload your asset to, which could be created programmatically by [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) as show in the example workflow.

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input-2)

- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could come from another GitHub Action, for example the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) GitHub Action

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-for-successful-upload) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The ID of the asset
- `browser_download_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to download the release asset. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/download/v1.0.0/example.zip`

### Example workflow - upload a release asset
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) and [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset). This Workflow example assumes you have the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) Action in a previous step:

```yaml
```

This will upload a release artifact to an existing release, outputting the `browser_download_url` for the asset which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses. For more information, see the GitHub Documentation for the [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) endpoint.

54,"# Download workflow artifact GitHub Action

An action that downloads and extracts uploaded artifacts associated with a given workflow and commit or other criteria.

Let\'s suppose you have a workflow with a job in it that at the end uploads an artifact using `actions/upload-artifact` action and you want to download this artifact in another workflow that is run after the first one. Official `actions/download-artifact` does not allow this. That\'s why I decided to create this action. By knowing only the workflow name and commit SHA or other details, you can download the previously uploaded artifact from different workflow associated with that commit or other criteria and use it.

## Usage

> If `commit` or `pr` or `branch` or `run_id` or `workflow_conclusion` is not specified then the artifact from the most recent successfully completed workflow run will be downloaded.

**Do not specify `pr`, `commit`, `branch`, `run_id` together or `workflow_conclusion` and `run_id` together. Pick just one of each or none.**

| upload_url  | The URL for uploading assets to the release.  |

## Example
This example will create a release when a tag is pushed:

```yml
```

## Notes
- You must provide a tag either via the action input or the git ref (i.e push / create a tag). If you do not provide a tag the action will fail.
- If the tag of the release you are creating does not yet exist, you should set both the `tag` and `commit` action inputs. `commit` can point to a commit hash or a branch name (ex - `main`).
- In the example above only required permissions for the action specified (which is `contents: write`). If you add other actions to the same workflow you should expand `permissions` block accordingly.

57,"# Github Action - CI bot

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), 
to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to rerun you failure checks in PR.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An example workflow is available below. For more
information, reference the Github Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

- `repo_owner`: The owner of the repository
- `repo_name`: The name of the repository
- `rerun_cmd`: The commands string to rerun all failure checks
- `comments`: The comments string of the PR

### Example workflow

On every `issue_comment` created to the pull request matching the `rerun_cmd`.

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

[![.github/workflows/integration.yml](https://github.com/actions/github-script/workflows/Integration/badge.svg?event=push&branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/github-script/actions?query=workflow%3AIntegration+branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)
[![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/actions/github-script/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push&branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/github-script/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)
[![.github/workflows/licensed.yml](https://github.com/actions/github-script/workflows/Licensed/badge.svg?event=push&branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/github-script/actions?query=workflow%3ALicensed+branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)

This action makes it easy to quickly write a script in your workflow that
uses the GitHub API and the workflow run context.

To use this action, provide an input named `script` that contains the body of an asynchronous function call.
The following arguments will be provided:

- `github` A pre-authenticated
  [octokit/rest.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js) client with pagination plugins
- `context` An object containing the [context of the workflow
  run](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/github/src/context.ts)
- `core` A reference to the [@actions/core](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/core) package
- `glob` A reference to the [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) package
- `io` A reference to the [@actions/io](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/io) package
- `exec` A reference to the [@actions/exec](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/exec) package
- `fetch` A reference to the [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) package
- `require` A proxy wrapper around the normal Node.js `require` to enable
  requiring relative paths (relative to the current working directory) and
  requiring npm packages installed in the current working directory. If for
  some reason you need the non-wrapped `require`, there is an escape hatch
  available: `__original_require__` is the original value of `require` without
  our wrapping applied.

Since the `script` is just a function body, these values will already be
defined, so you don\'t have to import them (see examples below).

See [octokit/rest.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/) for the API client
documentation.

## Breaking Changes

### Breaking changes in V6

Version 6 of this action updated the runtime to Node 16 - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-nodejs-v16

All scripts are now run with Node 16 instead of Node 12 and are affected by any breaking changes between Node 12 and 16.

### Breaking changes in V5

Version 5 of this action includes the version 5 of `@actions/github` and `@octokit/plugin-rest-endpoint-methods`. As part of this update, the Octokit context available via `github` no longer has REST methods directly. These methods are available via `github.rest.*` - https://github.com/octokit/plugin-rest-endpoint-methods.js/releases/tag/v5.0.0

For example, `github.issues.createComment` in V4 becomes `github.rest.issues.createComment` in V5

`github.request`, `github.paginate`, and `github.graphql` are unchanged.

## Development

See [development.md](/docs/development.md).

## Reading step results

The return value of the script will be in the step\'s outputs under the
""result"" key.

```yaml
```

See [""Result encoding""](#result-encoding) for details on how the encoding of
these outputs can be changed.

## Result encoding

By default, the JSON-encoded return value of the function is set as the ""result"" in the
output of a github-script step. For some workflows, string encoding is preferred. This option can be set using the
`result-encoding` input:

```yaml
```

## Retries

By default, requests made with the `github` instance will not be retried. You can configure this with the `retries` option:

```yaml
```

In this example, request failures from `github.rest.issues.get()` will be retried up to 3 times.

You can also configure which status codes should be exempt from retries via the `retry-exempt-status-codes` option:

```yaml
```

By default, the following status codes will not be retried: `400, 401, 403, 404, 422` [(source)](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js/blob/9a2443746c350b3beedec35cf26e197ea318a261/src/index.ts#L14).

These retries are implemented using the [octokit/plugin-retry.js](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js) plugin. The retries use [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) to space out retries. ([source](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js/blob/9a2443746c350b3beedec35cf26e197ea318a261/src/error-request.ts#L13))

## Examples

Note that `github-token` is optional in this action, and the input is there
in case you need to use a non-default token.

By default, github-script will use the token provided to your workflow.

### Print the available attributes of context

```yaml
```

### Comment on an issue

```yaml
```

### Apply a label to an issue

```yaml
```

### Welcome a first-time contributor

You can format text in comments using the same [Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) as the GitHub web interface:

```yaml
```

### Download data from a URL

You can use the `github` object to access the Octokit API. For
instance, `github.request`

```yaml
```

_(Note that this particular example only works for a public URL, where the
diff URL is publicly accessible. Getting the diff for a private URL requires
using the API.)_

This will print the full diff object in the screen; `result.data` will
contain the actual diff text.

### Run custom GraphQL queries

You can use the `github.graphql` object to run custom GraphQL queries against the GitHub API.

```yaml
```

### Run a separate file

If you don\'t want to inline your entire script that you want to run, you can
use a separate JavaScript module in your repository like so:

```yaml
```

And then export a function from your module:

```javascript
```

Note that because you can\'t `require` things like the GitHub context or
Actions Toolkit libraries, you\'ll want to pass them as arguments to your
external function.

Additionally, you\'ll want to use the [checkout
action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to make sure your script file is
available.

### Run a separate file with an async function

You can also use async functions in this manner, as long as you `await` it in
the inline script.

In your workflow:

```yaml
```

And then export an async function from your module:

```javascript
```

### Use npm packages

Like importing your own files above, you can also use installed modules.
Note that this is achieved with a wrapper on top `require`, so if you\'re
trying to require a module inside your own file, you might need to import
it externally or pass the `require` wrapper to your file:

```yaml
```

### Use ESM `import`

To import an ESM file, you\'ll need to reference your script by an absolute path and ensure you have a `package.json` file with `""type"": ""module""` specified.

For a script in your repository `src/print-stuff.js`:

```js
```

```yaml
```

### Use env as input

You can set env vars to use them in your script:

```yaml
```

### Using a separate GitHub token

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` used by default is scoped to the current repository, see [Authentication in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).

If you need access to a different repository or an API that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn\'t have permissions to, you can provide your own [PAT](https://help.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) as a secret using the `github-token` input.

# Gradle Wrapper Validation Action

This action validates the checksums of [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) JAR files present in the source tree and fails if unknown Gradle Wrapper JAR files are found.

## The Gradle Wrapper Problem in Open Source

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` is a binary blob of executable code that is checked into nearly
[2.8 Million GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/search?l=&q=filename%3Agradle-wrapper.jar&type=Code).

Searching across GitHub you can find many pull requests (PRs) with helpful titles like \'Update to Gradle xxx\'.
Many of these PRs are contributed by individuals outside of the organization maintaining the project.

Many maintainers are incredibly grateful for these kinds of contributions as it takes an item off of their backlog.
We assume that most maintainers do not consider the security implications of accepting the Gradle Wrapper binary from external contributors.
There is a certain amount of blind trust open source maintainers have.
Further compounding the issue is that maintainers are most often greeted in these PRs with a diff to the `gradle-wrapper.jar` that looks like this.

![Image of a GitHub Diff of Gradle Wrapper displaying text \'Binary file not shown.\'](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1323708/71915219-477d7780-3149-11ea-9254-90c80dbffb0a.png)

A fairly simple social engineering supply chain attack against open source would be contribute a helpful \xe2\x80\x9cUpdated to Gradle xxx\xe2\x80\x9d PR that contains malicious code hidden inside this binary JAR.
A malicious `gradle-wrapper.jar` could execute, download, or install arbitrary code while otherwise behaving like a completely normal `gradle-wrapper.jar`.

## Solution

We have created a simple GitHub Action that can be applied to any GitHub repository.
This GitHub Action will do one simple task:
verify that any and all `gradle-wrapper.jar` files in the repository match the SHA-256 checksums of any of our official releases.

If any are found that do not match the SHA-256 checksums of our official releases, the action will fail.

Additionally, the action will find and SHA-256 hash all
[homoglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph)
variants of files named `gradle-wrapper.jar`,
for example a file named `gradl\xd0\xb5-wrapper.jar` (which uses a Cyrillic `\xd0\xb5` instead of `e`).
The goal is to prevent homoglyph attacks which may be very difficult to spot in a GitHub diff.
We created an example [Homoglyph attack PR here](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/playframework/pull/1/files).

## Usage

### Add to an existing Workflow

Simply add this action to your workflow **after** having checked out your source tree and **before** running any Gradle build:

```yaml
```

### Add a new dedicated Workflow

Here\'s a sample complete workflow you can add to your repositories:

**`.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml`**
```yaml
name: ""Validate Gradle Wrapper""
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validation:
    name: ""Validation""
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - ```

## Contributing to an external GitHub Repository

Since [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
are completely free for open source projects and are automatically enabled on almost all projects,
adding this check to a project\'s build is as simple as contributing a PR.
Enabling the check requires no overhead on behalf of the project maintainer beyond merging the action.

You can add this action to your favorite Gradle based project without checking out their source locally via the
GitHub Web UI thanks to the \'Create new file\' button.

![GitHub \'Create new file\' Button bar picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1323708/73676469-6c023c00-4682-11ea-8c0a-5a1e2d29b17f.png)

Simply add a new file named `.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml` with the contents mentioned above.

We recommend the message commit contents of:
 - Title: `Official Gradle Wrapper Validation Action`
 - Body (at minimum): `See: https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action`

From there, you can easily follow the rest of the prompts to create a Pull Request against the project.

## Reporting Failures

If this GitHub action fails because a `gradle-wrapper.jar` doesn\'t match one of our published SHA-256 checksums,
we highly recommend that you reach out to us at [security@gradle.com](mailto:security@gradle.com).

**Note:** `gradle-wrapper.jar` generated by Gradle 3.3 to 4.0 are not verifiable because those files were dynamically generated by Gradle in a non-reproducible way. It\'s not possible to verify the `gradle-wrapper.jar` for those versions are legitimate using a hash comparison. You should try to determine if the `gradle-wrapper.jar` was generated by one of these versions before running the build.

If the Gradle version in `gradle-wrapper.properties` is out of this range, you may need to regenerate the `gradle-wrapper.jar` by running `./gradlew wrapper`. If you need to use a version of Gradle between 3.3 and 4.0, you can use a newer version of Gradle to generate the `gradle-wrapper.jar`.

If you\'re curious and want to explore what the differences are between the `gradle-wrapper.jar` in your possession
and one of our valid release, you can compare them using this online utility: [diffoscope](https://try.diffoscope.org/).
Regardless of what you find, we still kindly request that you reach out to us and let us know.

[![CI Status](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/actions)
![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/burrunan/gradle-cache-action?label=release)
[![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.7.10-blue.svg?logo=kotlin)](http://kotlinlang.org)

This is a GitHub Action for caching Gradle caches.
In other words, this is [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) customized for Gradle.

Key improvements over [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) and [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action) are:
- \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Gradle remote build cache backend (pulls only the needed entries from GitHub cache)
- \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89 Support multiple remote caches via [gradle-multi-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-multi-cache) (e.g. GitHub Actions + S3)
- \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Simplified configuration (action name + gradle command is enough for most case)
- \xf0\x9f\x91\xbe Less space usage (GitHub imposes overall 5GiB limit by default, so cache space matters)
- \xf0\x9f\x94\x97 Link to Build Scan in build results
- \xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 Gradle build failure markers added to the diff view (e.g. `compileJava` or `compileKotlin` markers right in the commit diff)

## Usage

Add the following code to your workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

Note: Like with [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action), you can
specify `gradle-version: release` to test with the current release version of Gradle, `gradle-version: nightly` for testing Gradle nightly builds,
an so on (see `gradle-version` below).

Note: For the [security reasons](https://julienrenaux.fr/2019/12/20/github-actions-security-risk/)
you might want to use Git SHA rather than branch name or tag name.
In other words, to avoid accidental tag update, you might want to use
`burrunan/gradle-cache-action@03c71a8ba93d670980695505f48f49daf43704a6` rather than `burrunan/gradle-cache-action@v1`.
Please see releases page to find out the commit ids: https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/releases

You might use the following references are:
* `v1` -- this is a *moving* qualifier. It points to the latest release among `v1.x`
* `v1.0`, `v1.1`, ... -- those are fixed versions. They won\'t change over time

For the best security you might want to use `burrunan/gradle-cache-action@v1` (see the ids at https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/releases)

```yaml
```

By default, the action enables the `local` build cache, and it adds a remote build cache
that stores the data in GitHub Actions cache.
However, you might want to enable the [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)
for your local builds to make them faster, or even add a remote cache instance, so your local
builds can reuse artifacts that are build on CI.

This is how you can enable local build cache (don\'t forget to add `--build-cache` option or
`org.gradle.caching=true` property):

```kotlin
```

## Sample integrations

Here\'s how you can integrate build cache to existing projects:

* Apache Calcite: https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2114
* Apache JMeter: https://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/611
* pgjdbc: https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/1862
* junit-pioneer: https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/pull/325
* opentelemetry-java-instrumentation: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/pull/1054

## Configuration

The default configuration should suit most of the cases, however, there are extra knobs:

```yaml
```

## How does dependency caching work?

The current GitHub Action\'s cache (both [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action and
[@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) npm package) is immutable.

The cache can\'t be updated, so it does not work very good for caches like ""Gradle dependencies"" or ""Maven local repository"".

`gradle-cache-action` creates a layered cache, and it uses a small ""index"" cache to identify the required layers.
If only a small fraction of files changes, then the action reuses the existing caches, and it adds a layer on top of it.
That enables to save cache space (GitHub has a default limit of 5 GiB), and it reduces upload time as only
the cache receives only the updated files.

## How does GitHub Actions-based Gradle remote build cache work?

`gradle-cache-action` launches a small proxy server that listens for Gradle requests and
then it redirects the requests to the `@actions/cache` API.

That makes Gradle believe it is talking to a regular remote cache, and the cache receives
only the relevant updates.
The increased granularity enables GitHub to evict entries better (it removes unused entries
automatically).

The action configures the URL to the cache proxy via the `~/.gradle/init.gradle` script, and
[Gradle picks it up automatically](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html)

Note: Saving GitHub Actions caches might take noticeable time (e.g. 100 ms), so the cache uploads
in the background. In other words, build scan would show virtually zero response times for
cache save operations.

If your build already has a remote cache declared (e.g. you are using your own cache),
then `gradle-cache-action` would configure **both** remote caches.
It would read from the GitHub cache first, and it would save data to both caches.

The multi-cache feature can be disabled via `multi-cache-enabled: false`.

## How to enable build scans?

1. Read and agree to the terms of service: https://gradle.com/terms-of-service
1. Add `--scan` to `arguments:`, and add the following to `settings.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
```

## Why another action instead of gradle-command-action?

`gradle-command-action` was started as a Kotlin/JS experiment for making a customized
[@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) that would make Gradle builds faster.

Then it turned out there\'s a proxy remote cache requests to the `@actions/cache` API can be used when the caching
action executes Gradle, so the `gradle-cache-action` got a Gradle execution feature.

Of course, the same could have been made in [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action),
however:
- The author was not familiar with TypeScript ecosystem (stdlib, typical libraries, testing libraries, etc.)
- Caching logic is collections-heavy, and Kotlin stdlib shines here.

  For instance, in Kotlin `list + list` adds lists, and `array.associateWith { valueFor(it) }` converts arrays to maps.
  This is easy to write without consulting StackOverflow, the code is readable, and it does not require
  you [to fight with the compiler](https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2016/06/create-es2015-map-from-array-in-typescript.html).

- A single language helps when building connected components.
  `gradle-cache-action` integrates with [gradle-multi-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-multi-cache) and
  [gradle-s3-build-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-s3-build-cache), and they all are Kotlin-based. 

## Can I use the caching part of the action only?

Yes, you can. If you omit `arguments:`, then the action runs in `cache-only` mode.
It won\'t launch Gradle.

## Can I call multiple different Gradle builds in the same job?

This might be complicated, see https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/issues/15.

Currently, the workaround is to configure `execution-only-caches: true` for all but one
`gradle-cache-action` executions.
Then one of the actions would do the cache save and restore, and the rest would use their own
caches only.

## Known issue

Running `shellcheck.exe` on Windows might fail with the following error:

`SC1017: Literal carriage return. Run script through tr -d \'\\r\'`

This is due to the presence of a carriage return character (`\\r`) in the script.

To fix this, you can simply create or edit the `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository with the following contents:

```
```
This would ensure that the scripts are checked out with the correct line ending.

[![labeler release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/srvaroa/labeler?sort=semver)](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases)  

Implements an all-in-one [GitHub
Action](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions)
that can manage multiple labels for both Pull Requests and Issues using
configurable matching rules. Available conditions:

* [Author can merge](#author-can-merge): label based on whether the author can merge the PR
* [Authors](#authors): label based on the PR/Issue authors
* [Base branch](#base-branch): label based on the PR\'s base branch
* [Body](#body): label based on the PR/Issue body
* [Branch](#branch): label based on the PR branch
* [Draft](#draft): label based on whether the branch is mergeable
* [Files](#files): label based on the files modified in the PR
* [Mergeable](#mergeable): label based o whether the PR is mergeable
* [Size](#size): label based on the PR size
* [Title](#title): label based on the PR/Issue title

## Sponsors

Thanks to [Launchgood](https://github.com/launchgood) for sponsoring
this project.

Please consider supporting the project if your organization is finding
it useful, you can do this through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/srvaroa).

## Installing

The action is configured by adding a file `.github/labeler.yml`. The
file contains matching rules expanded in the `Configuration` section
below.

The action will strive to maintain backwards compatibility with older
configuration versions. It is nevertheless encouraged to update your
configuration files to benefit from newer features. Please follow our
[releases](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases) page to stay up
to date.

### GitHub Enterprise support

Add `GITHUB_API_HOST` to your env variables, it should be in the form
`http(s)://[hostname]/`

Please consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/srvaroa) if you\'re using Labeler in your organization!

### How to trigger action

To trigger the action on events, add a file `.github/workflows/main.yml`
to your repository: 

```yaml
```

Using `@master` will run the latest available release. Feel free to pin
this to a specific version from the [releases
page](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases).

Use the [`on`
clause](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)
to control when to run it.

* To trigger on PR events, [use
  `pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request).
  to trigger on PR events and run on the merge commit of the PR. Use
  [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)
  instead if you prefer to run on the base.
* To trigger on issue events, add [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues).

You may combine multiple event triggers.

A final option is to trigger the action periodically using the
[`schedule`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)
trigger. For backwards compatibility reasons this will examine all
active pull requests and update their labels. If you wish to examine
issues as well, you\'ll need to explicitly add the `issues` flag in your
config file:

```yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

This action will avoid failing in all cases, so if you\'re experiencing
unexpected behaviour it\'s worth looking at execution logs.  Typical
errors are:

* The configuration file is non existent, or invalid yaml.
* Running the action from a fork, as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has not enough
  permissions to label the main repository ([issue for
  solving this](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/issues/3))

## Configuring matching rules

Configuration can be stored at `.github/labeler.yml` as a plain list of
label matchers, which consist of a label and a set of conditions for
each.  When *all* conditions for a label match, then the Action will set
the given label.  When *any* condition for a label does not match, then
the Action will unset the given label.

All matchers follow this configuration pattern:

```yaml
```

For example, this `.github/labeler.yml` contains a single matcher with
a single condition:

```yaml
```

A PR or issue with title ""WIP: this is work in progress"" would be
labelled as `WIP`.  If the title changes to ""This is done"", then the
`WIP` label would be removed.

Each label may combine multiple conditions.  The action combines all
conditions with an AND operation.  That is, the label will be applied if
*all* conditions are satisfied, removed otherwise.

For example, given this `.github/labeler.yml`:

```yaml
  mergeable: false
```

A pull request with title ""WIP: this is work in progress"" *and* not in a
mergeable state would be labelled as `WIP`.  If the title changes to
""This is done"", or it becomes mergeable, then the `WIP` label would be
removed.

If you wish to apply an OR, you may set multiple matchers for the same
label. For example:

```yaml
- label: ""WIP""
  mergeable: false
```

The `WIP` label will be set if the title matches `^WIP:.*` OR the label
is not in a mergeable state.

### Negate rules

Adding a `negate` property inside the label block will negate the
result of the evaluation of all conditions inside the label. For
example:

```yaml
```

In this case, label `unknown` will be set if the branch does NOT match
`master` or `hotfix`.

The same behaviour occurs with multiple conditions:

```yaml
```

Only PRs that do NOT match one of the two conditions will get the
`unknown` label.

## Append-only mode

The default behaviour of this action includes *removing* labels that
have a rule configured that does not match anymore. For example, given
this configuration:

```yaml
```

A PR or issue with title \'WIP: my feature\' will get the `WIP` label.

Now the title changes to `My feature` the label will get remove. This is
because the labeler configuration includes the `WIP` label, and its rule
does not match anymore.

In some cases you would prefer that the action adds labels, but never
removes them regardless of the matching status. To achieve this you can
enable the `appendOnly` flag.

```yaml
```

With this config, the behaviour changes:

- A PR with title \'WIP: my feature\' will get the `WIP` label.
- When the title changes to `My feature`, even though the labeler has a
  rule for the `WIP` label that does not match, the label will be
  respected.

## Conditions

Below are the conditions currently supported in label matchers, in 
alphabetical order. Note that some conditions are only applicable to
pull requests.

All conditions evaluate only when they are explicitly added in
configuration (that is, there are no default values).

### Author can merge (PRs) <a name=""author-can-merge"" />

This condition is satisfied when the author of the PR can merge it.
This is implemented by checking if the author is an owner of the repo.

```yaml
```
### Authors (PRs and Issues)  <a name=""authors"" />

This condition is satisfied when the author of the PR or Issue matches
any of the given usernames.

```yaml
```

### Base branch (PRs only) <a name=""base-branch"" />

This condition is satisfied when the PR base branch matches on the given
regex.

```yaml
```

### Body (PRs and Issues) <a name=""body"" />

This condition is satisfied when the body (description) matches on the
given regex.

``` yaml
```

### Branch (PRs only) <a name=""branch"" />

This condition is satisfied when the PR branch matches on the given
regex.

```yaml
```

### Draft status (PRs only) <a name=""draft"" />

This condition is satisfied when the PR [draft
state](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#response-1) matches that of the
PR.

```yaml
```

Matches if the PR is a draft.

```yaml
```

Matches if the PR is not a draft.

### Files affected (PRs only) <a name=""files"" />

This condition is satisfied when any of the PR files matches on the
given regexs.

```yaml
```

### Mergeable status (PRs only) <a name=""mergeable"" />

This condition is satisfied when the [mergeable
state](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#response-1) matches that
of the PR. 

```yaml
```

Will match if the label is mergeable. 

```yaml
```

Will match if the label is not mergeable. 

### Size (PRs only) <a name=""size"" />

This condition is satisfied when the total number of changed lines in
the PR is within given thresholds.

The number of changed lines is calculated as the sum of all `additions +
deletions` in the PR.

For example, given this `.github/labeler.yml`:

```yaml
```

These would be the labels assigned to some PRs, based on their size as
reported by the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls).

|PR|additions|deletions|Resulting labels|
|---|---|---|---|
|First example|1|1|S|
|Second example|5|42|M|
|Third example|68|148|L|

You can exclude some files so that their changes are not taken into
account for the overall count. This can be useful for `yarn.lock`,
`go.sum` and such. Use `exclude-files`:

```yaml
``` 

This condition will apply the `L` label if the diff is above 100 lines,
but NOT taking into account changes in `yarn.lock`.

**NOTICE** the old format for specifying size properties (`size-above`
and `size-below`) has been deprecated. The action will continue
supporting old configs for now, but users are encouraged to migrate to
the new configuration schema.

### Title <a name=""title"" />

This condition is satisfied when the title matches on the given regex.

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

## Usage

You can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:

```yaml
```

If you\'re unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.

## Configuration

Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository. The configuration file **must** reside in your default branch, no other configurations will be accepted.

### Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:

<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
```

## Configuration Options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

| Key                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `$COMPLETE` | The complete version string (including any prerelease info). |

## Version Resolver

With the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

The above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.

If a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.

## References

**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)

References takes an list and accepts strings and regex.
If none are specified, we default to the repository\xe2\x80\x99s default branch usually master.

```yaml
```

Currently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:

<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using the embedded Autolabeler functionality (see below),
[PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

Optionally you can add a `collapse-after` entry to your category item, if the category has more than the defined `collapse-after` pull requests then it will show all pull requests collapsed for that category. Append the `collapse-after` integer to your category as following:

```yml
```

## Exclude Pull Requests

With the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.

## Include Pull Requests

With the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""app-foo"" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.

## Exclude Contributors

By default, the `$CONTRIBUTORS` variable will contain the names or usernames of all the contributors of a release. The `exclude-contributors` option allows you to remove certain usernames from that list. This can be useful if don\'t wish to include yourself, to better highlight only the third-party contributions.

```yml
```

## Replacers

You can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.

```yml
```

## Autolabeler

You can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).
Matchers are evaluated independently; the label will be set if at least one of the matchers meets the criteria.

```yml

## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## Action Inputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.

| Input         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `config-name` | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that\'s where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `name`        | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `name-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `tag`         | The tag name to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `tag-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `version`     | The version to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any version calculated by the release-drafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `publish`     | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |
| `prerelease`  | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated is a prerelease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `commitish`   | A string specifying the target branch for the release being created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `header`      | A string that would be added before the template body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `footer`      | A string that would be added after the template body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Action Outputs

The Release Drafter GitHub Action sets a couple of outputs which can be used as inputs to other Actions in the workflow ([example](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset)).

| Output       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | The ID of the release that was created or updated.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
```

Once you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Runs test
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub, which triggers GitHub Action that does the following:
    - Push GitHub app to Heroku
    - Releases NPM
    - Publish the Release Draft!

# \xe2\x9d\x8c\xf0\x9f\x96\xa5\xef\xb8\x8f [DEPRECATED] XVFB Github Action

THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED, PLEASE SWITCH TO: https://github.com/coactions/setup-xvfb

This action installs [XVFB](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/38-headless) and runs your headless tests with it. It cleans up the xvfb process after your tests are done. If it detects you're not using linux then your tests still run, but without xvfb, which is very practical for multi-platform workflows.

### Example usage

Lock Threads is a GitHub Action that locks closed issues
and pull requests after a period of inactivity.

<img width=""800"" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dessant/lock-threads/master/assets/screenshot.png"">

### Filtering issues and pull requests

This step will lock only issues, and exclude issues created before 2018,
or those with the `upstream` or `help-wanted` labels applied.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will lock only pull requests, and exclude those
with the `wip` label applied.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will lock only issues, and exclude issues closed before 2018,
or those created in 2018 and 2019.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will lock issues that have the `incomplete` _or_ `invalid`
labels applied, and pull requests that have the `qa: done` _and_ `published`
labels applied.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will lock issues that have not had any activity in the past 180 days.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Commenting and labeling

This step will post a comment on issues and pull requests before locking them,
and apply the `outdated` label to issues.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will apply the `qa: done` and `archived` labels,
and remove the `qa: primary` and `needs: user feedback` labels
before locking issues.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

## How are issues and pull requests determined to be inactive?

The action uses GitHub\'s [updated](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated)
search qualifier to determine inactivity. Any change to an issue or pull request
is considered an update, including comments, changing labels,
applying or removing milestones, or pushing commits.

An easy way to check and see which issues or pull requests will initially
be locked is to add the `updated` search qualifier to either the issue
or pull request search field for your repository:
`is:closed is:unlocked updated:<2018-12-20`.
Adjust the date to be 365 days ago (or whatever you set for `*-inactive-days`)
to see which issues or pull requests will be locked.

## Why are only some issues and pull requests processed?

To avoid triggering abuse prevention mechanisms on GitHub, only 50 issues
and pull requests will be handled at once. If your repository has more
than that, it will just take a few hours or days to process them all.

# msvc-dev-cmd

[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for configuring Developer Command Prompt for Microsoft Visual C++.

This sets up the environment for compiling C/C++ code from command line.

Supports Windows. Does nothing on Linux and macOS.

## Example usage

Basic usage for default compilation settings is like this:

```yaml
```

If you want something non-default,
like using a specific version of Visual Studio,
or cross-compling for a differen target,
you will need to configure those settings via inputs:

```yaml
```

## Inputs

- `arch` \xe2\x80\x93 target architecture
  - native compilation:
    - `x64` (default) or its synonyms: `amd64`, `win64`, `x86_64`, `x86-64`
    - `x86` or its synonyms: `win32`
  - cross-compilation: `x86_amd64`, `x86_arm`, `x86_arm64`, `amd64_x86`, `amd64_arm`, `amd64_arm64`
- `sdk` \xe2\x80\x93 Windows SDK to use
  - do not specify to use the default SDK
  - or specify full Windows 10 SDK number (e.g, `10.0.10240.0`)
  - or write `8.1` to use Windows 8.1 SDK
- `toolset` \xe2\x80\x93 select VC++ compiler toolset version
  - do not specify to use the default toolset
  - `14.0` for VC++ 2015 Compiler Toolset
  - `14.XX` for the latest 14.XX toolset installed (e.g, `14.11`)
  - `14.XX.YYYYY` for a specific full version number (e.g, `14.11.25503`)
- `uwp` \xe2\x80\x93 set `true` to build for Universal Windows Platform (i.e., for Windows Store)
- `spectre` \xe2\x80\x93 set `true` to use Visual Studio libraries with [Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com) mitigations

- `vsversion` - The Visual Studio version to use. This can be the version number (e.g. 16.0 for 2019) or the year (e.g. ""2019"").

## Caveats

### Name conflicts with `shell: bash`

Using `shell: bash` in Actions may shadow some of the paths added by MSVC.
In particular, `link.exe` (Microsoft C linker) is prone to be shadowed by `/usr/bin/link` (GNU filesystem link tool).

Unfortunately, this happens because GitHub Actions unconditionally *prepend* GNU paths when `shell: bash` is used,
on top of any paths set by `msvc-dev-cmd`, every time at the start of each new step.
Hence, there aren\'t many non-destructive options here.

If you experience compilation errors where `link` complains about unreasonable command-line arguments,
\xe2\x80\x9cextra operand *something-something*\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that\'s probably it.
Recommended workaround is to remove `/usr/bin/link` if that interferes with your builds.
If this is not acceptable, please file an issue, then we\'ll figure out something better.

### Reconfiguration

You can invoke `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` multiple times during your jobs with different inputs
to reconfigure the environment for building with different settings
(e.g., to target multiple architectures).

```yaml
```

This mostly works but it\'s not really recommended
since Developer Command Prompt was not meant for recursive reconfiguration.
That said, if it does not work for you, please file an issue.

Consider using [`strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)
to execute different build configuration in parallel, independent environments.

69,"# Octokit Request Action

> A GitHub Action to send arbitrary requests to GitHub\'s REST API

[![Build Status](https://github.com/octokit/request-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octokit/request-action/actions)

## Usage

Minimal example

```yml
```

More complex examples involving `POST`, setting custom media types, and parsing output data

```yml
```

Handle errors

```yml
```

## Inputs

To use request body parameters, simply pass in an `input` matching the parameter name. See previous examples.

Due to how request parameters are processed, it may be necessary in some cases to first encode the value as either JSON or a block scalar:

```yml
```

## Debugging

To see additional debug logs, create a secret with the name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and value `true`.

## How it works

`octokit/request-action` is using [`@octokit/request`](https://github.com/octokit/request.js/) internally with the addition
that requests are automatically authenticated using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. It is required to prevent rate limiting, as all anonymous requests from the same origin count against the same low rate.

The actions sets `data` output to the response data. The action also sets the `headers` (again, to a JSON string) and `status` output properties.

To access deep values of `outputs.data` and `outputs.headers`, check out the [fromJson](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#fromjson) function.

## Warnings

The GitHub Actions runners are currently showing warnings when using this action that look like:

```
```

The reason for this warning is because the `repository` key is not listed as a possible value in `actions.yml`. This warning will appear for any key used under the `with` except `route` and `mediaType`. Due to the flexible nature of the required inputs depending on the `route`, not all of the possible parameters can be listed in `actions.yml`, so you will see this warning under normal usage of the action. As long as you see a 200 response code at the bottom of the output, everything should have worked properly and you can ignore the warnings. The response code will appear at the bottom of the output from the action and looks like:

```
```

This action sets up an Elixir environment for use in a GitHub Actions
workflow by:

- Installing OTP
- Installing Elixir

**Note** Currently, this action currently only supports Actions\' `ubuntu-` runtimes.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

**Note** The OTP release version specification is [relatively
complex](http://erlang.org/doc/system_principles/versions.html#version-scheme).
For best results, we recommend specifying exact OTP and Elixir versions.
However, values like `22.x` are also accepted, and we attempt to resolve them
according to semantic versioning rules.

Additionally, it is recommended that one specifies OTP and Elixir versions
using YAML strings, as these examples do, so that numbers like `23.0` don\'t
end up being parsed as `23`, which is not equivalent.

For pre-release Elixir versions, such as `1.11.0-rc.0`, use the full version
specifier (`1.11.0-rc.0`). Pre-release versions are opt-in, so `1.11.x` will
not match a pre-release.

### Basic example

```yaml
```

### Matrix example

```yaml
```

### Phoenix example

```yaml
```

#### Authenticating with Postgres in Phoenix

When using the Phoenix example above, the `postgres` container has some
default authentication set up. Specifically, it expects a username of
""postgres"", and a password of ""postgres"". It will be available at
`localhost:5432`.

The simplest way of setting these auth values in CI is by checking for the
`GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable that is set in all workflows:

```elixir
```

73,"# setup-ruby

This action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.

It is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.
No extra packages need to be installed.

**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.
If you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit
will be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).

### Supported Versions

This action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:

| Interpreter | Versions |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `ruby` | 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.9, 2.2, all versions from 2.3.0 until 3.3.0-preview1, head, debug, mingw, mswin, ucrt |
| `jruby` | 9.1.17.0 - 9.4.3.0, head |
| `truffleruby` | 19.3.0 - 23.0.0, head |
| `truffleruby+graalvm` | 21.2.0 - 23.0.0, head |

`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  

Regarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64
builds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.

Preview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).
However, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,
as it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.

Only release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)
are available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10
on other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.

Note that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,
which means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.

### Supported Platforms

The action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.

| Operating System | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |
| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |
| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |

The prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)
and on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).
The `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).
`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),
`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),
`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)
and `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).
The full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)
for Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.

## Usage

### Single Job

```yaml
```

### Matrix of Ruby Versions

This matrix tests all stable releases and `head` versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby on Ubuntu and macOS.

```

### Matrix of Gemfiles

```yaml
```

See the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the
[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
and the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Supported Version Syntax

* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`
* short version like `\'2.6\'`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.10`)
* version only like `\'2.6.5\'`, assumes MRI for the engine
* engine only like `ruby` and `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation
* `.ruby-version` reads from the project\'s `.ruby-version` file
* `.tool-versions` reads from the project\'s `.tool-versions` file
* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`

### Working Directory

The `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`
if they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.

### RubyGems

By default, the default RubyGems version that comes with each Ruby is used.
However, users can optionally customize the RubyGems version that they want by
setting the `rubygems` input.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `rubygems` input.

If you\'re running into `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 4,
expected 1)` errors with a stacktrace including Psych and RubyGems entries, you
should be able to fix them by setting `rubygems: 3.0.0` or higher.

### Bundler

By default, Bundler is installed as follows:

* If there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,
  that version of Bundler will be installed and used.
* If the Ruby ships with Bundler 2.2+ (as a default gem), that version is used.
* Otherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.3, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.3).

This behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `bundler` input.

### Caching `bundle install` automatically

This action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:
```yaml
```

Note that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.

This caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  
It needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  
If there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.

To use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level
as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).

#### bundle config

When using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.
These can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.
They should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).
To find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.
You might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.

To perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  
Therefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).

#### How it Works

When there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.
In other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.
The hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.

#### Dealing with a corrupted cache

In some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system
at the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.
In order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value
if you have already used it before.)

```yaml
        cache-version: 1
```

#### Caching `bundle install` manually

It is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.
There are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).
So, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.

## Windows

Note that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.
It is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.

* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.
* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).
* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.
* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.
* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.
* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).
* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).

## Versioning

It is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.
This will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.

If you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and
it will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.
Make sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.

This action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.
This follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.

## Using self-hosted runners

This action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
if the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:

* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.
* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.
* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed
* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,
  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.
  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.
* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.

In other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case
(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).
You could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.

## History

This action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.
Please [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.

74,"# GitHub Action - Publish Gem to Rubygems

This is a GitHub Action written to streamline the Ruby gem publication process.  The action sets the Gem Credentials from `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY`secrets, and then runs `rake release` in your project root.  You can override this command by setting `RELEASE_COMMAND` environment variable to the script that creates and publishes (this is usually only the case when a repository hosts multiple gems together).

# Secrets Needed

`GITHUB_TOKEN` - Bundler needs this to create tags on your repo for the release
`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` - The Rubygems API Key for an Owner of the Gem you wish to publish.  You can find your API Key by looking in `~/.gem/credentials` or using the [Rubygems API](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#misc-methods)

# Environment Variables

`RELEASE_COMMAND` - By default, this will invoke `rake release` to build and publish the gem to Rubygems.  Set this environment variable if you have a custom release command to be invoked

`WORKDIR` - Sets the workdir where bundle and the release will be run

# Example

```yml
```

76,"# rsync deployments

This GitHub Action (amd64) deploys files in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to a remote folder via rsync over ssh. 

Use this action in a CD workflow which leaves deployable code in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

The base-image [drinternet/rsync](https://github.com/JoshPiper/rsync-docker/) of this action is very small and is based on Alpine 3.17.2 (no cache) which results in fast deployments.

---

## Inputs

- `switches`* - The first is for any initial/required rsync flags, eg: `-avzr --delete`

- `rsh` - Remote shell commands

- `path` - The source path. Defaults to GITHUB_WORKSPACE and is relative to it

- `remote_path`* - The deployment target path

- `remote_host`* - The remote host

- `remote_port` - The remote port. Defaults to 22

- `remote_user`* - The remote user

- `remote_key`* - The remote ssh key

- `remote_key_pass` - The remote ssh key passphrase (if any)

``* = Required``

## Required secret(s)

This action needs secret variables for the ssh private key of your key pair. The public key part should be added to the authorized_keys file on the server that receives the deployment. The secret variable should be set in the Github secrets section of your org/repo and then referenced as the  `remote_key` input.

> Always use secrets when dealing with sensitive inputs!

For simplicity, we are using `DEPLOY_*` as the secret variables throughout the examples.

## Example usage

Simple:

```
```

Advanced:

```
```

For better **security**, I suggest you create additional secrets for remote_host, remote_port, remote_user and remote_path inputs.

```
```

If your private key is passphrase protected you should use:

```
        remote_key_pass: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY_PASS }}
```

**We are in process of archiving this repository.** This Action was created before GitHub CLI was an option. We believe there are now better options for creating pull requests using GitHub Actions.

We recommend using GitHub CLI directly in your workflow file. See: [`gh pr create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create)

For example:

```yaml

This action sets up a java environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a requested version of java by version and adding to PATH. Default downloads are populated from the [Zulu Community distribution of OpenJDK](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/)
- registering problem matchers for error output

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
```
Examples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:

- A major Java version

  e.g. ```6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...```
 
- A semver Java version specification

  e.g. ```8.0.232, 7.0.181, 11.0.4```
  
  e.g. ```8.0.x, >11.0.3, >=13.0.1, <8.0.212```
  
- An early access (EA) Java version

  e.g. ```14-ea, 15-ea```
  
  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea, 15.0.0-ea```
   
  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea.28, 15.0.0-ea.2``` (syntax for specifying an EA build number)
  
  Note that, per semver rules, EA builds will be matched by explicit EA version specifications.
  
- 1.x syntax

    e.g. ```1.8``` (same as ```8```)
    
    e.g. ```1.8.0.212``` (same as ```8.0.212```)


## Local file
```yaml
```

## Matrix Testing
```yaml
```

## Publishing using Apache Maven
```yaml
```

The two `settings.xml` files created from the above example look like the following.

`settings.xml` file created for the first deploy to GitHub Packages
```xml
```

`settings.xml` file created for the second deploy to Apache Maven Central
```xml
```

***NOTE: The `settings.xml` file is created in the Actions $HOME directory. If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***\t

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.

## Publishing using Gradle
```yaml
```

***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***\t

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.

## Apache Maven with a settings path

When using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file. Setting the `settings-path` variable allows you to choose a unique location for your settings file.

```yaml

81,"# Setup NuGet.exe

This action downloads and installs a given version of `NuGet.exe`. Using this
action will add `nuget` to your `$PATH` on all operating systems, including
macOS and linux, without having to prefix it with `mono`.

NuGet functionality also gets delivered with Visual Studio, msbuild and dotnet SDK. You should consider using the
official [`setup-dotnet`](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) or
[one of the `msbuild` actions](https://github.com/marketplace?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=msbuild).

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Supported values for `nuget-version`:

* `latest` -- the latest blessed NuGet release.
* `preview` -- the latest EarlyAccessPreview release.
* `X.Y.Z` -- concrete semver version for a release (e.g. `5.3.1`).
* semver range -- any [valid semver range specifier](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges) (e.g. `5`, `>=5`, `5.3.x`, etc)

This action also supports configuring your NuGet API key using
[GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).
The API key should be passed in as an `nuget-api-key` input. See
[the GitHub documentation on secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets)
for how to configure secrets on your repository.

### Basic:

```yaml
```

### Matrix Testing:

```yaml
```

# Caching

The downloaded `nuget.exe` files are automatically cached between runs. To cache
your global nuget directory, consider using the [official cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#c---nuget).

### Caching Example

Note: For this example, you\'ll need to enable [repeatable builds](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/) for your project.

```yaml
```

# Contributing

## Code in Main

Install the dependencies
```bash
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:
```bash
```

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

This action tries to figure out the current PR.

If the event is a `pull_request`, it\'s very easy to get the current PR number
from the context via `${{ github.event.number }}`, but unfortunately this
information does not seem to be readily available for a `push` event.  This
action sends a request to GitHub to find the PR associated with the current SHA,
and returns its number in the `number` output. `number` will be an empty string if there is no
PR.

Additionally, `title` and `body` outputs are available as well to get the respective title and body of the PR.

By default, `gh-find-current-pr` will only return open PRs.  You can pass in a
`state` parameter to pick ""open"", ""closed"", or ""all"" PRs.

84,"# Pull Request Labeler

[![Basic validation](https://github.com/actions/labeler/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/labeler/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml)

Automatically label new pull requests based on the paths of files being changed.

## Usage

### Create `.github/labeler.yml`

Create a `.github/labeler.yml` file with a list of labels and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) globs to match to apply the label.

The key is the name of the label in your repository that you want to add (e.g. `merge conflict`, `needs-updating`) and the value is the path (glob) of the changed files (e.g. `src/**`, `tests/*.spec.js`) or a match object.

#### Match Object

For more control over matching, you can provide a match object instead of a simple path glob. The match object is defined as:

```yml
```

One or both fields can be provided for fine-grained matching. Unlike the top-level list, the list of path globs provided to `any` and `all` must ALL match against a path for the label to be applied.

The fields are defined as follows:
* `any`: match ALL globs against ANY changed path
* `all`: match ALL globs against ALL changed paths

A simple path glob is the equivalent to `any: [\'glob\']`. More specifically, the following two configurations are equivalent:
```yml
```
and
```yml
```

From a boolean logic perspective, top-level match objects are `OR`-ed together and individual match rules within an object are `AND`-ed. Combined with `!` negation, you can write complex matching rules.

> \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This action uses [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) to apply glob patterns.
> For historical reasons, paths starting with dot (e.g. `.github`) are not matched by default.
> You need to set `dot: true` to change this behavior.
> See [Inputs](#inputs) table below for details.

#### Basic Examples

```yml
```

#### Common Examples

```yml
```

### Create Workflow

Create a workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the labeler action with content:

```yml
```

#### Inputs

Various inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml) to let you configure the labeler:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Default               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `repo-token`         | Token to use to authorize label changes. Typically the GITHUB_TOKEN secret                                                                                               | `github.token`        |
| `configuration-path` | The path to the label configuration file. If the file doesn\'t exist at the specified path on the runner, action will read from the source repository via the Github API. | `.github/labeler.yml` |
| `sync-labels`        | Whether or not to remove labels when matching files are reverted or no longer changed by the PR                                                                          | `false`               |
| `dot`                | Whether or not to auto-include paths starting with dot (e.g. `.github`)                                                                                                  | `false`               |
| `pr-number`          | The number(s) of pull request to update, rather than detecting from the workflow context                                                                                 | N/A                   |

##### Using `configuration-path` input together with the `@actions/checkout` action
You might want to use action called [@actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to upload label configuration file onto the runner from the current or any other repositories. See usage example below:

```yml
```

##### Peculiarities of using the `dot` input

When `dot` is disabled, and you want to include _all_ files in a folder:

```yml
```

If `dot` is enabled:

```yml
```

##### Example workflow specifying Pull request numbers

```yml
```

**Note:** in normal usage the `pr-number` input is not required as the action will detect the PR number from the workflow context.


#### Outputs 

Labeler provides the following outputs:  

| Name         | Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `new-labels` | A comma-separated list of all new labels                  |
| `all-labels` | A comma-separated list of all labels that the PR contains |

The following example performs steps based on the output of labeler:
```yml
```

## Permissions

In order to add labels to pull requests, the GitHub labeler action requires
write permissions on the pull-request. However, when the action runs on a pull
request from a forked repository, GitHub only grants read access tokens for
`pull_request` events, at most. If you encounter an `Error: HttpError: Resource
not accessible by integration`, it\'s likely due to these permission constraints.
To resolve this issue, you can modify the `on:` section of your workflow to use
[`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)
instead of `pull_request` (see example [above](#create-workflow)). This change
allows the action to have write access, because `pull_request_target` alters the
[context of the
action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)
and safely grants additional permissions. Refer to the [GitHub token
permissions
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)
for more details about access levels and event contexts.

85,"# GitHub Required Review Check

This [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) will check that required reviewers have
accepted the PR, setting a status check accordingly.

## Example

```yaml
```

## Usage

This action is intended to be triggered by the `pull_request_review` event.

```yaml
```

## Requirements Format

The requirements consist of an array of requirement objects. A requirement object has the following keys:

* `name` is an optional informative name for the requirement.
* `paths` is an array of path patterns, or the string ""unmatched"". If an array, the reviewers
  specified will be checked if any path in the array matches any path in the PR. If the string
  ""unmatched"", the reviewers are checked if any file in the PR has not been matched yet.
* `consume` is a boolean, defaulting to false. If set, any paths that match this rule will be ignored
  for all following rules.

  This is intended for things like lockfiles or changelogs that you might want to allow everyone
  to edit in any package in a monorepo, to avoid having to manually exclude these files in every
  requirement for each different team owning some package.
* `teams` is an array of strings that are GitHub team slugs in the organization or repository. A
  review is required from a member of any of these teams.

  Instead of a string, a single-keyed object may be specified. The key is either `all-of` or
  `any-of`, and the value is an array as for `teams`. When the key is `all-of`, a review is required
  from every team (but if a person is a member of multiple teams, they can satisfy multiple
  requirements). When it\'s `any-of`, one review from any team is needed.

  Additionally, you can specify a single user by prefixing their username with `@`. For example,
  `@example` will be treated as a virtual team with one member; `example`.

Paths are matched using the [picomatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picomatch#globbing-features) library.

Every requirement object that applies must have appropriate reviews, it\'s not ""first match"". Thus,
using the example below, a PR touching file at docs/foo.css would need reviews satisfying both
the ""Docs"" and ""Front end"" review requirements. If you wanted to avoid that, you might add
`!**.css` to the first\'s paths or `!docs/**` to the second\'s.

</p>

**setup-msys2** is a JavaScript GitHub Action (GHA) to setup a full-featured [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment, using the GHA [toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).

The latest tarball available at [repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64](http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/) is cached. Using the action extracts it and provides an entrypoint named `msys2do`.

## Usage

```yaml
```

### Options

#### msystem

By default, `MSYSTEM` is set to `MINGW64`. However, an optional parameter named `msystem` is supported, which expects `MSYS`, `MINGW64` or `MING32`. For example:

```yaml
```

Furthermore, the environment variable can be overriden. This is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts. For example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:

```yaml
  - run: msys2do makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar
  - run: msys2do pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz
  - run: |
      set MSYSTEM=MINGW64
      msys2do <command to test the package>
```

#### path-type

By default, `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE` is set to `strict` by `msys2do`. It is possible to override it either using an option or setting the environment variable explicitly:

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

#### update

By default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball. By setting option `update` to `true`, the action will execute `pacman -Syu --no-confirm`:

# Checkout V3

This action checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.

Only a single commit is fetched by default, for the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow. Set `fetch-depth: 0` to fetch all history for all branches and tags. Refer [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) to learn which commit `$GITHUB_SHA` points to for different events.

The auth token is persisted in the local git config. This enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The token is removed during post-job cleanup. Set `persist-credentials: false` to opt-out.

When Git 2.18 or higher is not in your PATH, falls back to the REST API to download the files.

# What\'s new

- Updated to the node16 runtime by default
  - This requires a minimum [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.285.0) version of v2.285.0 to run, which is by default available in GHES 3.4 or later.

89,"# setup-ruby

This action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.

It is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.
No extra packages need to be installed.

**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.
If you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit
will be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).

### Supported Versions

This action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:

| Interpreter | Versions |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `ruby` | 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.9, 2.2, all versions from 2.3.0 until 3.3.0-preview1, head, debug, mingw, mswin, ucrt |
| `jruby` | 9.1.17.0 - 9.4.3.0, head |
| `truffleruby` | 19.3.0 - 23.0.0, head |
| `truffleruby+graalvm` | 21.2.0 - 23.0.0, head |

`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  

Regarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64
builds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.

Preview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).
However, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,
as it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.

Only release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)
are available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10
on other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.

Note that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,
which means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.

### Supported Platforms

The action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.

| Operating System | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |
| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |
| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |

The prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)
and on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).
The `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).
`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),
`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),
`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)
and `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).
The full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)
for Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.

## Usage

### Single Job

```yaml
```

### Matrix of Ruby Versions

This matrix tests all stable releases and `head` versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby on Ubuntu and macOS.

```yaml
```

### Matrix of Gemfiles

```yaml
```

See the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the
[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
and the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Supported Version Syntax

* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`
* short version like `\'2.6\'`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.10`)
* version only like `\'2.6.5\'`, assumes MRI for the engine
* engine only like `ruby` and `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation
* `.ruby-version` reads from the project\'s `.ruby-version` file
* `.tool-versions` reads from the project\'s `.tool-versions` file
* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`

### Working Directory

The `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`
if they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.

### RubyGems

By default, the default RubyGems version that comes with each Ruby is used.
However, users can optionally customize the RubyGems version that they want by
setting the `rubygems` input.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `rubygems` input.

If you\'re running into `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 4,
expected 1)` errors with a stacktrace including Psych and RubyGems entries, you
should be able to fix them by setting `rubygems: 3.0.0` or higher.

### Bundler

By default, Bundler is installed as follows:

* If there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,
  that version of Bundler will be installed and used.
* If the Ruby ships with Bundler 2.2+ (as a default gem), that version is used.
* Otherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.3, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.3).

This behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `bundler` input.

### Caching `bundle install` automatically

This action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:
```yaml
```

Note that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.

This caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  
It needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  
If there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.

To use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level
as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).

#### bundle config

When using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.
These can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.
They should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).
To find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.
You might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.

To perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  
Therefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).

#### How it Works

When there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.
In other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.
The hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.

#### Dealing with a corrupted cache

In some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system
at the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.
In order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value
if you have already used it before.)

```yaml
        cache-version: 1
```

#### Caching `bundle install` manually

It is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.
There are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).
So, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.

## Windows

Note that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.
It is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.

* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.
* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).
* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.
* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.
* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.
* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).
* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).

## Versioning

It is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.
This will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.

If you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and
it will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.
Make sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.

This action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.
This follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.

## Using self-hosted runners

This action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
if the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:

* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.
* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.
* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed
* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,
  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.
  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.
* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.

In other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case
(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).
You could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.

## History

This action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.
Please [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.

## Credits

The current maintainer of this action is @eregon.
Most of the Windows logic is based on work by MSP-Greg.
Many thanks to MSP-Greg and Lars Kanis for the help with Ruby Installer.

Installing Qt on Github Actions workflows manually is the worst.

You know what\'s easier than dealing with that? Just using this:
```yml
```

All done.

## Upgrade Guides
Each new major version of this project includes changes that can break workflows written to use an older version of
this project. These changes are summarized here, to help you upgrade your existing workflows.

[Upgrading `install-qt-action`](README_upgrade_guide.md)

## Options

### `version`
The desired version of Qt to install.

You can also pass in SimpleSpec version numbers, for example `6.2.*`.

Default: `5.15.2` (Last Qt 5 LTS)

**Please note that for Linux builds, Qt 6+ requires Ubuntu 20.04 or later.**

### `host`
This is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It\'s unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.

For example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.

Possible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`

Defaults to the current platform it is being run on.

### `target`
This is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts and Win RT builds are only supported on Windows hosts.

Possible values: `desktop`, `android`, `ios`, or `winrt`

Default: `desktop`

### `arch`
This is the target architecture that your program will be built for.

**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro\'s repository or building it manually.

**Possible values:**

You can find a full list of architectures easily by using [this awesome website](https://ddalcino.github.io/aqt-list-server/).

**Default values:**

Windows w/ Qt < 5.6: `win64_msvc2013_64`

Windows w/ Qt >= 5.6 && Qt < 5.9: `win64_msvc2015_64`

Windows w/ Qt >= 5.9 && Qt < 5.15: `win64_msvc2017_64`

Windows w/ Qt >= 5.15: `win64_msvc2019_64`

Android: `android_armv7`

### `dir`
This is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.

For example, if you set dir to `${{ github.workspace }}/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/example/Qt/5.15.2/{arch}/bin`.
When possible, access your Qt directory through the `QT_ROOT_DIR` environment variable; this will point to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/example/Qt/5.15.2/{arch}` in this case.

Default: `$RUNNER_WORKSPACE` (this is one folder above the starting directory)

### `install-deps`
Whether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux through `apt`.

Can be set to `nosudo` to stop it from using sudo, for example on a docker container where the user already has sufficient privileges.

Default: `true`

### `modules`
String with whitespace delimited list of additional addon modules to install, with each entry separated by a space. If you need one of these, you\'ll know it.

Possible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, and more

Default: none

### `archives`
String with whitespace delimited list of Qt archives to install, with each entry separated by a space. Typically you don\'t need this unless you are aiming for bare minimum installation. I would strongly advise reading the [aqtinstall docs](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installing-a-subset-of-qt-archives-advanced) before using this feature.

Possible values: `qtbase`, `qtsvg`, `qtdeclarative`, `qtgamepad`, `qtgraphicaleffects`, `qtimageformats`, `qtlocation`

Default: none

### `cache`

Whether to cache Qt automatically. If it is set to `true`, then Qt won\'t be downloaded if a cached version is available, but the environment variables will always be set, and essential build tools will always be installed.

Default: `false`

### `cache-key-prefix`

Prefix to be used for the cache key of the automatic cache.

Default: `install-qt-action`

### `setup-python`

Set this to false if you want to skip using setup-python to find/download a valid python version. If you are on a self-hosted runner, you will probably need to set this to false because setup-python [requires a very specific environment to work](https://github.com/actions/setup-python#using-setup-python-with-a-self-hosted-runner).

Default: `true`

### `tools`

Qt ""tools"" to be installed.
Specify the tool name and tool variant name separated by commas, and separate multiple tools with spaces.
If you wish to install all tools available for a given tool name, you can leave off the tool variant name.
I would advise reading the [aqtinstall docs](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installing-tools) for more info on installing tools.

For example, this value will install the most recent versions of QtIFW and QtCreator: 
```
```

You can find a full list of tools easily by using [this awesome website](https://ddalcino.github.io/aqt-list-server/).

### `source`

Set this to `true` to install Qt source code. Incompatible with `aqtinstall < 2.0.4`.

Default: `false`

### `src-archives`

String with whitespace delimited list of source archives to install, with each entry separated by a space.
Has no effect unless `source` is set to `true`.
Useful to limit download size.

See the `--archives` flag for [aqt install-src](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#install-src-command) for more details.
Use [aqt list-src](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#list-src-command) to see available options.

Default: none

### `documentation`

Set this to `true` to install Qt documentation files. Incompatible with `aqtinstall < 2.0.4`.

Default: `false`

### `doc-archives`

String with whitespace delimited list of documentation archives to install, with each entry separated by a space.
Has no effect unless `documentation` is set to `true`.
Useful to limit download size.

See the `--archives` flag for [aqt install-doc](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#install-doc-command) for more details.

## More info
For more in-depth and certifiably up-to-date documentation, check the documentation for aqtinstall [here](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

The Qt bin directory is appended to your `path` environment variable.
`Qt5_DIR` is also set appropriately for CMake if you are using Qt 5.
In addition, `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`, `QML2_IMPORT_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set accordingly. `IQTA_TOOLS` is set to the ""Tools"" directory if tools are installed as well.

Since the Qt bin directory is in your `path`, you will not need to set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` CMake variable.
If you wish to do so, you can set it to either `${QT_ROOT_DIR}` or to `${QT_ROOT_DIR}/lib/cmake`.

91,"# `install-qt-action`

Installing Qt on Github Actions workflows manually is the worst.

You know what's easier than dealing with that? Just using this:
```yml
```

All done.

## Options

### `version`
The desired version of Qt to install.

Default: `5.12.6` (Latest LTS at the time of writing)

### `host`
This is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It's unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.

For example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.

Possible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`

Defaults to the current platform it is being run on.

### `target`
This is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. 

**Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts**

Possible values: `desktop`, `android`, or `ios`

Default: `desktop`

### `arch`
This is the target architecture that your program will be built for. This is only used for Windows and Android.

**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro's repository or building it manually.

**Possible values:**

Windows: `win64_msvc2017_64`, `win64_msvc2015_64`, `win32_msvc2015`, `win32_mingw53`, or `win64_mingw73`

Android: `android_x86`, `android_armv7`

**Default values:**

Windows: `win64_msvc2017_64`

Android: `android_armv7`

### `dir`
This is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.

For example, if you set dir to `/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `/example/Qt/5.12.6/(your_arch)/bin`. When possible, access your Qt directory through the `Qt5_Dir` environment variable.

Default: `${RUNNER_WORKSPACE}` (this is one folder above the starting directory)

### `install-deps`
Whether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux (you probably want to leave this on).

Default: `true`

### `modules`
List of additional addon modules to install, with each entry seperated by a space. If you need one of these, you'll know it.

Possible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, possibly others

Default: none

### `cached`
If it is set to `true`, then Qt won't be downloaded, but the environment variables will be set, and essential build tools will be installed.

It can be used with [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache), for example:

```
```

### `aqtversion`

Version of [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall), in the form used by pip, for example: `==0.7.1`, `>=0.7.1`, `==0.7.*`.

## More info

The Qt bin directory is added to your `path` environment variable. `Qt5_Dir` is also set appropriately for cmake.

93,"# GitHub Action for Uploading Release Artifacts

This repository contains a simple GitHub Action implementation which allows you to attach binaries to a new (github) release of your repository.

* [GitHub Action for Uploading Release Artifacts](#github-action-for-uploading-release-artifacts)
  * [Enabling the action](#enabling-the-action)
  * [Sample Configuration](#sample-configuration)
  * [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration)
  * [GITHUB_TOKEN](#github_token)


## Enabling the action

There are two steps required to use this action:

* Enable the action inside your repository.
  * This will mean creating a file `.github/workflows/release.yml` which is where the action is invoked.
  * You\'ll specify a pattern to describe which binary-artifacts are uploaded.
* Ensure your binary artifacts are generated.
  * Ideally you should do this in your workflow using another action.


## Sample Configuration

The following configuration file uses _this_ action, along with the [github-action-build](https://github.com/skx/github-action-build) action to generate the artifacts for a project, then attach them to a release.

```yml
```

This is the preferred approach because it uses a pair of distinct actions, each having one job:

* [skx/github-action-build](https://github.com/skx/github-action-build/)
  * Generates the build artifacts.
  * i.e. Compiles your binaries.
* [skx/github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries)
  * Uploads the previously-generated the build artifacts.


## Advanced Configuration

This action is primarily intended to be invoked upon a release-event, which means that Github itself will create a new release, and the action will upload the specified artifacts to that release.

However it might be that you wish to **create** a new release within an action, then modify it by populating the content and adding artifacts.   This is possible, because we allow you to specify the ID of the release to which your artifacts should be associated.

You\'ll want to configure it using something like this:

```yml
```

Here we\'re explicitly passing the `releaseId` variable, such that the specified release ID will be used.



## `GITHUB_TOKEN`

Your workflow configuration file, named `.github/workflows/release.yml`, will contain a reference to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, however you do __not__ need to generate that as it is automatically created. You will however need to update your repository settings under `Actions -> General` to give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write access to upload binaries to the release, without write access you will get a `403` response error.

You _can_ inject secrets into workflows, defining them in the project settings, and referring to them by name, but the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value is special and it is handled transparently, requiring no manual setup.

## Inputs

| Name         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                         | Type   | Default |
| ------------ | :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------ | --------|
| `toolchain`  |          | [Toolchain](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#toolchain-specification) name to use, ex. `stable`, `nightly`, `nightly-2019-04-20`, or `1.32.0` | string | stable  |
| `target`     |          | Additionally install specified target for this toolchain, ex. `x86_64-apple-darwin`                                                                 | string |         |
| `default`    |          | Set installed toolchain as a default toolchain                                                                                                      | bool   | false   |
| `override`   |          | Set installed toolchain as an override for the current directory                                                                                    | bool   | false   |
| `profile`    |          | Execute `rustup set profile {value}` before installing the toolchain, ex. `minimal`                                                                 | string | default |
| `components` |          | Comma-separated list of the additional components to install, ex. `clippy, rustfmt`                                                                 | string |         |

Note: since `v1.0.4` version, `toolchain` input is not marked as required
in order to support toolchain files. See the details [below](#the-toolchain-file).

## Outputs

Installed `rustc`, `cargo` and `rustup` versions can be fetched from the Action outputs:

| Name         | Description           | Example                         |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `rustc`      | Rustc version         | `1.40.0 (73528e339 2019-12-16)` |
| `rustc_hash` | Rustc version hash    | `73528e339`                     |
| `cargo`      | Cargo version         | `1.40.0 (bc8e4c8be 2019-11-22)` |
| `rustup`     | rustup version        | `1.21.1 (7832b2ebe 2019-12-20)` |

Note: `rustc_hash` output value can be used with [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) Action
to store cache for different Rust versions, as it is unique across different Rust versions and builds (including `nightly`).

## Profiles

This Action supports rustup [profiles](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/15/Rustup-1.20.0.html#profiles),
which are can be used to speed up the workflow execution by installing the
minimally required set of components, for example:

```yaml
```

This Action will automatically run `rustup self update` if `profile` input is set
and the installed `rustup` version does not supports them.

In order to provide backwards compatibility for `v1` version,
there is no value for `profile` input set by default,
which means that the `default` profile is used by `rustup`
(and that includes `rust-docs`, `clippy` and `rustfmt`).\\
You may want to consider using `profile: minimal` to speed up toolchain installation.

## Components

This Action supports rustup [components](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/15/Rustup-1.20.0.html#installing-the-latest-compatible-nightly) too,
and in combination with the [profiles](#profiles) input it allows to install only the needed components:

```yaml
```

As an extra perk, `rustup >= 1.20.0` is able to find the most recent `nightly` toolchain
with the requested components available; next example is utilizing this feature
to install the minimal set of `nightly` toolchain components with the `rustfmt` and `clippy` extras:

```yaml
```

In case if `nightly` toolchain is requested and one of the components is missing in
latest `nightly` release, this Action will attempt the downgrade till it find
the most recent `nightly` with all components needed.\\
Note that this behavior will work only if the following two conditions apply:

 1. `toolchain` input is `nightly` exactly.
 2. At least one component is provided in `components` input.

Same to the `profile` input, if installed `rustup` does not supports ""components"",
it will be automatically upgraded by this Action.

## The toolchain file

This Action supports [toolchain files](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file),
so it is not necessary to use `toolchain` input anymore.

Input has higher priority, so if you are want to use toolchain file,
you need to remove the input from the workflow file.

If neither `toolchain` input or `rust-toolchain` file are provided,
Action execution will fail.

95,"# Maven Publish Action

**GitHub Action for automatically publishing Maven packages**

## Overview

This action\xe2\x80\xa6

- Executes the Maven `deploy` lifecycle phase
- Provides Maven with your GPG key and passphrase so your artifacts can be signed using `maven-gpg-plugin`
- Provides Maven with your Nexus credentials so it can deploy and release your project

It will also use the `deploy` Maven profile if you\'ve defined one (in case you want to perform certain steps only when deploying).

## Setup

### Deployment

It\'s recommended to publish using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin, which greatly simplifies the process. You can follow [this guide](./docs/deployment-setup.md) for a simple configuration.

Make sure your project is correctly configured for deployment before continuing with the next step.

### Workflow

#### Secrets

In your project\'s GitHub repository, go to Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. On this page, set the following variables:

- `nexus_username`: Username (not email!) for your Nexus repository manager account
- `nexus_password`: Password for your Nexus account (or, even better, use the [auth token](https://solidsoft.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/deploy-to-maven-central-using-api-key-aka-auth-token/) instead)

Signing your artifact using GPG is optional, but recommended. If you choose to use GPG, add the following secrets:

- `gpg_private_key`: GPG private key for signing the published artifacts:
  - Run `gpg --list-secret-keys` and copy the ID of the key you\'d like to use
  - Export the key with `gpg -a --export-secret-keys KEY_ID` (and replace `KEY_ID` with the ID you copied)
- `gpg_passphrase`: Passphrase for the GPG key

If you sign your artifacts, make sure the `maven-gpg-plugin` is configured as described [here](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/action-maven-publish/blob/master/docs/deployment-setup.md#project-configuration).

#### Workflow file

Create a GitHub workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/release.yml`) in your repository. Use the following configuration, which tells GitHub to use the Maven Publish Action when running your CI pipeline. The steps are self-explanatory:

```yml
```

The action will now run every time you push to `master`.

## Configuration

In addition to the input variables listed above, the action can be configured with the following options:

- **`directory`:** Directory of the Maven project to deploy. Default: Repository root
- **`maven_profiles`:** Active Maven profiles. Default: `""deploy""`
- **`maven_goals_phases`:** Maven goals and build phases to execute. Default: `""clean deploy""`
- **`maven_args`:** Additional arguments to pass to the Maven command. Default: `""""`
- **`server_id`:** The default Nexus instance used by this action is OSSRH. If you are deploying to a different Nexus instance, you can specify the server ID you\'ve used in your project\'s POM file (in the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` and `distributionManagement` configurations) here

96,"# Gitstamp for GitHub Actions

[![Project license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Public%20Domain-blue.svg)](https://unlicense.org)
[![Gitstamp](https://github.com/weavery/gitstamp-action/workflows/Gitstamp/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavery/gitstamp-action/actions?query=workflow%3AGitstamp)

This is a [GitHub Action] for timestamping your Git commits using the
[Arweave] permaweb.

By adding this action to your GitHub repository, the SHA-1 commit hash and
commit metadata of your latest commit will get permanently and uncensorably
timestamped on Arweave every time you push to the repository.

This makes it easy to prove to any third party that a particular commit was
created no later than the time when it was timestamped on Arweave.

## Sample

The Git commit metadata is recorded on the blockweave as follows:

<img alt=""Screenshot of Gitstamp metadata"" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weavery/gitstamp-action/master/sample.png"" width=""480""/>

See the [Gitstamp specification] for more particulars.

[Gitstamp specification]: https://github.com/weavery/gitstamp.dev#specification

## Usage

Once you are set up with an [Arweave wallet], using this action in your
GitHub project is straightforward:

### `.github/workflows/gitstamp.yaml`

Paste the following into a `.github/workflows/gitstamp.yaml` file in your
GitHub repository:

```yaml
```

### Repository secrets

Add the contents of an Arweave wallet key file to a GitHub repository
secret. The secret can be named anything you like, but we suggest
`GITSTAMP_KEYFILE` to match the workflow file above.

## Costs

Each Arweave transaction requires an enclosed transaction fee to pay for
transaction processing and permanent storage on the Arweave network.
In practice, this works out to less than USD$0.00001 per timestamped commit.
(In other words, a USD$1 wallet will suffice for at least 100,000 commits.)

This fee is deducted from the wallet configured in the repository secrets.

## Dependencies

- [Arweave JS](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js)

## Inputs

### `wallet-key`

The Arweave wallet key to use for signing transactions and paying
transaction fees.

## `commit-link`

A boolean indicating whether to include a GitHub commit link.
Defaults to `false` for privacy reasons.

## Outputs

### `transaction-id`

The Arweave transaction ID.

For example, `guSFLDoc3dvdeZg-fBCp6uLeLHb_gGLCW__eefqtHM0`.

### `transaction-link`

The Arweave transaction explorer link on [ViewBlock.io](https://viewblock.io).

For example, <https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/guSFLDoc3dvdeZg-fBCp6uLeLHb_gGLCW__eefqtHM0>.

### `response-code`

The Arweave HTTP API response status code.

### `response-text`

The Arweave HTTP API response status text.

99,"# release-gem

Github action that bumps the version, generates the changelog, releases the gem, and creates a Github release,

This action uses the [conventional_changelog](https://github.com/dcrec1/conventional-changelog-ruby) gem to update the CHANGELOG.md file, and the [bump](https://github.com/gregorym/bump) gem to handle the version increments. It assumes that the repository is using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The gem dependencies in the action are managed independently from the dependencies of the gem that is being released.

Feel free to use this action for gems outside the Pact Foundation, however, its intent is only for Pact Foundation gems, so if you want to make any changes, please fork it and maintain your own version.

## Usage

In your workflow YAML file:

```
```

A GitHub action to create a repository dispatch event.

## Usage

Dispatch an event to the current repository.
```yml
```

Dispatch an event to a remote repository using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
```yml
```

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). See [token](#token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch. | `github.repository` (current repository) |
| `event-type` | (**required**) A custom webhook event name. | |
| `client-payload` | JSON payload with extra information about the webhook event that your action or workflow may use. | `{}` |

#### Token

This action creates [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event) events.
The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` token can only be used if you are dispatching the same repository that the workflow is executing in.

To dispatch to a remote repository you must create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the `repo` scope and store it as a secret.
If you will be dispatching to a public repository then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.

You can also use a [fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) (beta). It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:
 - `contents: read & write`
 - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)

## Example

Here is an example setting all of the input parameters.

```yml
          client-payload: \'{""ref"": ""${{ github.ref }}"", ""sha"": ""${{ github.sha }}""}\'
```

Here is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event.
Note that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.

```yml
```

### Dispatch to multiple repositories

You can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix). In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.

```yml
```

## Client payload

The GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON.
If you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.

```
```

For example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.

```yml
```

To solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property.
The following payload will succeed.

```yml
```

Additionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`. A very large payload may result in a `client_payload is too large` error.

A GitHub action to automatically delete the branch after a pull request has been merged. Here\'s [a blog post](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-life-of-a-github-action/) describing this action in more detail.

> **NOTE:** This will **never** delete the repository\'s default branch or protected branches. If the pull request is closed _without_ merging, it will **not** delete it.

## Usage

```
```

If you include this in another Workflow, you may want to configure the environment variable `NO_BRANCH_DELETED_EXIT_CODE`. The default value for this is `78`, as Github Actions will mark a check as ""neutral"" (neither failed/succeeded) when you exit with code 78. This will however **cancel** any other actions running in parallel in this workflow.

If you don\'t want it to cancel, configure your workflow as follows:

```

## Keep up-to-date with GitHub Dependabot

Since [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-github-dependabot)
has [native GitHub Actions support](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#package-ecosystem),
to enable it on your GitHub repo all you need to do is add the `.github/dependabot.yml` file:

```yaml
```

## Limitation

This action is only available for Linux [virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#supported-virtual-environments-and-hardware-resources).

This action runs [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) with
[reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog) on pull requests to lint Dockerfile 
and validate inline bash.

## Examples

### With `github-pr-check`

By default, with `reporter: github-pr-check` an annotation is added to the line:

![Example comment made by the action, with github-pr-check](./examples/example-github-pr-check.png)

### With `github-pr-review`

With `reporter: github-pr-review` a comment is added to the Pull Request Conversation:

![Example comment made by the action, with github-pr-review](examples/example-github-pr-review.png)

## Inputs

## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb8 Usage

### \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa5 Limit releases to pushes to tags

Typically usage of this action involves adding a step to a build that
is gated pushes to git tags. You may find `step.if` field helpful in accomplishing this
as it maximizes the reuse value of your workflow for non-tag pushes.

Below is a simple example of `step.if` tag gating

```yaml
```

You can also use push config tag filter

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f Uploading release assets

You can configure a number of options for your
GitHub release and all are optional.

A common case for GitHub releases is to upload your binary after its been validated and packaged.
Use the `with.files` input to declare a newline-delimited list of glob expressions matching the files
you wish to upload to GitHub releases. If you\'d like you can just list the files by name directly.

Below is an example of uploading a single asset named `Release.txt`

```yaml
```

Below is an example of uploading more than one asset with a GitHub release

```yaml
```

> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note:** Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above \xe2\x98\x9d\xef\xb8\x8f. That let\'s you effectively declare a multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)

> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note for Windows:** Paths must use `/` as a separator, not `\\`, as `\\` is used to escape characters with special meaning in the pattern; for example, instead of specifying `D:\\Foo.txt`, you must specify `D:/Foo.txt`. If you\'re using PowerShell, you can do this with `$Path = $Path -replace \'\\\\\',\'/\'`

### \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d External release notes

Many systems exist that can help generate release notes for you. This action supports
loading release notes from a path in your repository\'s build to allow for the flexibility
of using any changelog generator for your releases, including a human \xf0\x9f\x91\xa9\xe2\x80\x8d\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb

```yaml
```

### \xf0\x9f\x92\x85 Customizing

| `discussion_category_name` | String  | If specified, a discussion of the specified category is created and linked to the release. The value must be a category that already exists in the repository. For more information, see [""Managing categories for discussions in your repository.""](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)                                                     |
| `generate_release_notes`   | Boolean | Whether to automatically generate the name and body for this release. If name is specified, the specified name will be used; otherwise, a name will be automatically generated. If body is specified, the body will be pre-pended to the automatically generated notes. See the [GitHub docs for this feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) for more information |
| `append_body`              | Boolean | Append to existing body instead of overwriting it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 When providing a `body` and `body_path` at the same time, `body_path` will be
attempted first, then falling back on `body` if the path can not be read from.

\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 When the release info keys (such as `name`, `body`, `draft`, `prerelease`, etc.)
are not explicitly set and there is already an existing release for the tag, the
release will retain its original info.

#### outputs

> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note:** This action was previously implemented as a Docker container, limiting its use to GitHub Actions Linux virtual environments only. With recent releases, we now support cross platform usage. You\'ll need to remove the `docker://` prefix in these versions

### Permissions

This Action requires the following permissions on the GitHub integration token:

```yaml
```

When used with `discussion_category_name`, additional permission is needed:

```yaml
  discussions: write
```

[GitHub token permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) can be set for an individual job, workflow, or for Actions as a whole.

[![Test](https://github.com/BSFishy/pip-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BSFishy/pip-action/actions)

This action installs pip packages.

## Usage
See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
```

All options:
```yaml
```

### Options
Here is a list of all of the available options supported by this action.

#### `packages`
The packages to install.
This option can replace the `requirements` input or `editable` input, but either this, the `requirements` option, or the `editable` option is required.

A list can be provided to specify multiple packages.
This syntax is a little different because actions only support string inputs.
Due to this, each individual package can have no whitespace except around it.

This option does not correspond to any additional command flags, as none are necessary.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `requirements`
A [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) to install from.
This option can replace the `packages` input or `editable` input, but either this, the `packages` option, or the `editable` option is required.

The input value should be a valid requirements file to install from.
It corresponds to the `--requirement` argument for pip.
Any valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.

No special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.
The value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `constriants`
A [constraints file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files) to install from.
This can be used to specify the versions of packages that are allowed to be installed.
It does **not** do anything to actually install new packages.

The input should be a valid constraints file to use.
It corresponds to the `--constraint` argument for pip.
Any valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.

No special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.
The value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `no-deps`
Specify not to install package dependencies.
This will cause only the packages specified to be installed, and none of their dependencies.

It corresponds to the `--no-deps` argument for pip.

It is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `pre`
Specify to install development or pre-release versions of packages.
This will allow the latest version of the package to be isntalled rather than the stable version.

It corresponds to the `--pre` argument for pip.

It is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `editable`
Install a package in editable mode.
This option can replace the `packages` input or `requirements` input, but either this, the `packages` option, or the `requirements` option is required.

The input should be a valid package to install.
It corresponds to the `--editable` argument for pip.
Any valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.

No special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.
The value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `platform`
Only install packages compatible with a specific platform.
This will default to the platform currently running.

The input should be a valid platform.
It corresponds to the [`--platform` argument for pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#cmdoption-platform).
Any valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.

No special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.
The value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `upgrade`
Specify to upgrade packages.
This will cause already installed packages to be upgraded if an upgrade is available.

It corresponds to the `--upgrade` argument for pip.

It is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

#### `extra`
Specify additional arguments to pass to pip.
These are extra options that may not be provided by independent inputs to this action.

It does not correspond to any pip arguments.
The input is passed directly to pip without any formatting.

**Examples:**
```yaml
```

### Additional info
Here is just a little bit of additional information to explain some things that may not be trivial.

#### Python location
It is highly recommended that you use the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action to install Python.
This streamlines the process and makes sure that you have a valid Python installed and located.

This action will automatically detect if Python is installed in 1 of two ways.
Firstly, it checks the `pythonLocation` environment variable.
This is set by the `setup-python` action, and is a directory pointing to the Python installation.

Secondly, if the `setup-python` action is not used, the path will be checked for Python.
If Python is found in the path environment variable, this action will use that version.
Otherwise, an error is thrown.

#### Empty strings
Empty strings are used to signify no input.
Github Actions only allow string key/value inputs, so inputs are always strings.
Inputs that are not specified automatically return an empty string.
Because of this, we use an empty string to signify an input has no value.
For most options, this will cause the argument to not appear in the final command.

108,"# GS Commit Message Checker

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gsactions/commit-message-checker?style=flat-square)
![Test](https://github.com/gsactions/commit-message-checker/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)

A GitHub action that checks that commit messages match a regex pattern. The
action is able to act on pull request and push events and check the pull
request title and body, or the commit message of the commits of a push.

On pull requests the title and body are concatenated, delimited by two line
breaks.

Designed to be very flexible in usage, you can split checks into various
workflows, use action types on pull request to listen on, define branches
for pushes etc. etc.

## Configuration

See also [action definition](action.yml) and the following example workflow.

More information about `pattern` and `flags` can be found in the
[JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).

`flags` is optional and defaults to `gm`.

`excludeDescription`, `excludeTitle` and `checkAllCommitMessages` are optional.
Default behavior is to include the description and title and not check pull
request commit messages.

### Example Workflow

```yml
```

### Troubleshooting and debugging

Most of the questions being asked here are not about bugs or missing features in
this action, but about not enough information about what is going on in the
background. A good first starting point is to [enable debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)
for the action, which can be accomplished by adding secrets to your repository.
After that, many additional information will appear in the logs and you should
be able to set up your configuration properly.

There are some really good tools that you can use to set up your pattern
properly for your needs. My favorite tool is <https://regexr.com/> which works
very well with this action.

If you need additional support, please head to the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GsActions/commit-message-checker/discussions)
of this repository.

## Development

### Quick Start

```sh
```

That\'s it, just start editing the sources...

### Commands

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful during the development
cycle.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the package to the `lib` folder.

#### `npm run format`

Runs Prettier on .ts and .tsx files and fixes errors.

#### `npm run format-check`

Runs Prettier on .ts and .tsx files without fixing errors.

#### `npm run lint`

Runs Eslint on .ts and .tsx files.

#### `npm run pack`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder.

#### `npm run test`

Runs Jest test suites.

#### `npm run all`

Runs all the above commands.

### Debugging

More information about debugging GitHub Actions can be found at <https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-debugging.md>.

The secrets `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` are both set to
`true` in the main repository.

# generate-changelog-action

GitHub Action for [lob/generate-changelog](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/). Intended to be used with [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release).

Created during the GitHub Actions Hackathon 2020 and [selected as one of the winning projects!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL6mjJXGt3-75GejQCubsOvWwtYcGaqbJA7msnsh7Tg/edit#gid=0&range=A100:C100)

## Usage

**Note:** [Your repository must contain a `package.json` file](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/issues/38#issuecomment-362726723), although an empty file such as [the one in this repository](https://github.com/ScottBrenner/generate-changelog-action/blob/master/package.json) is fine.

If your `package.json` isn\'t available in root directory of your repository, you can pass the path of the `package.json` file by setting `package-dir` as follows:

```yaml
```

By default, this Action generates changelogs using commits between the previous tag and the most recent tag. Generate changelogs from specific tag or range (e.g. `v1.2.3` or `v1.2.3..v1.2.4`) by passing the `from-tag` and `to-tag` inputs. An example is when your release tag on git is generated after the changelog so you must use something like `git log v1..HEAD --oneline`:

```yaml
```

This Action additionally supports the following inputs, in accordance with [lob/generate-changelog\'s CLI options](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/#cli).
| Property                  | Default       | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

110,"# action-kodi-addon-checker

![Kodi Logo](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/raw/master/docs/resources/banner_slim.png)

This action automatically runs [kodi-addon-checker](https://github.com/xbmc/addon-check) against your addon codebase. It checks the Kodi repo for best practices and produces a report containing found problems and warnings.
The action assumes you have your addon in the root path of your repository.

## Inputs

### `kodi-version`

**Required** The name of the minimal kodi version your addon is supposed to support (Default `""leia""`).
This is equivalent to the **branch** name where your addon lives in the official kodi repository ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/branches) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts/branches)).


### `addon-id`

**optional** The addon id of the addon being validated. This is used to extract the addon package using `git archive` and respect your `.gitattributes`. If not provided, the addon-check will allow folder id mismatching (by passing `--allow-folder-id-mismatch` to the tool).

### `is-pr`

**optional** If the action is being run as part of a pull request validation, normally used when the action is used as a step in automated submissions (Default `false`).

## `rewrite-for-matrix`

**optional** If the addon.xml should be re-written for kodi matrix - usefull if you are using the same branch to submit to two different branches (Default `false`).

## Example usage

To use this action in your github repository you need to have your addon code in the root directory of your github repository and name your repository accordingly (e.g. plugin.video.foo). The following example performs the addon validation on each git push or pull request taking into account you plan to submit your addon to the `leia` branch. The addon id is automatically extracted from your repository name.

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
111,"# action-kodi-addon-submitter

![Kodi Logo](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/raw/master/docs/resources/banner_slim.png)

This action submits your addon to the official Kodi repository every time you push a tag. In the background it uses [xbmc\'s kodi-addon-submitter](https://github.com/xbmc/kodi-addon-submitter).

## Inputs

### `kodi-repository`

**Required** The name of the repository to where you want to submit the addon. Values can be ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts)). Defaults to `repo-plugins`.

### `kodi-version`

**Required** The name of the minimal kodi version your addon is supposed to support. Default `""leia""`.
This is equivalent to the **branch** name where your addon lives in the official kodi repository ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/branches) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts/branches)).

### `addon-id`

**Required** The id of your addon as defined in [addon.xml](https://kodi.wiki/view/Addon.xml).

### `kodi-matrix`

**Optional** Boolean indicating if a Python 2/3 compatible addon will be submitted to the `matrix` branch in addition to the target branch. This can be used if you want to update a Python 2/3 compatible addon both in `matrix` (Kodi 19.x) and a lower branch at the same time. Do not use this option if you want to submit a Python 3 addon only to `matrix` branch. Use the `kodi-repository` input for this.

### `sub-directory`

**Optional** Boolean indicating if the addon is stored in its own directory within the git repo.

## Secrets

### `GH_TOKEN`

**Required** A secret in your addon github repository that contains a github token with at least public_repo scope.

### `EMAIL`

**Required** A secret containing your email address. This is used in `git config` to submit the pull request.

## Outputs

### `addon-zip`

Path to the addon release zip file

### `addon-zip-matrix`

Path to the addon release zip file for matrix (if `kodi-matrix` input is `true`). This zip uses PEP440 local version identifier.

## Example usage

The below configuration will automatically submit your addon to the kodi repository when you create a new tag/release. For instance, supposing your addon update is version `1.0.1`:

`git tag v1.0.1 && git push --tags`

The configuration below assumes you are submitting an addon with id `plugin.video.example` to the branch `leia` of `repo-plugins`.

```yaml
```

The configuration below automatically submits the addon to the same repository but also creates a github release and uploads the distribution zip to the github releases section of your github repository.


```yaml
```

**Note:** The idea of generating a distribution zip is to automatically exclude some of your files from the submission (e.g. tests, .gitignore, .gitattributes, etc). This can be accomplished if you store a `.gitattributes` file on the root of your repository containing the following:

```
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
112,"# ""Stale Issue Cleanup"" Action for GitHub Actions

This GitHub action warns and then closes issues and PRs without activity
after a specified amount of time. It improves upon [GitHub\'s original
stale action](https://github.com/actions/stale) by allowing the action 
to run only on issues that contain a specified label, and removing labels
once the issue sees new activity.

## Building and testing

Install dependencies
```bash
```

Run unit tests
```bash
```

### Local Integ Testing with Docker

This action is using Docker, so you can test it locally in dry run mode if you
wish.

```bash
```

Check out [local-docker.env](./test/local-docker.env) to configure your local
testing options. Once you\'re satisfied that it\'s working the way you expect,
you can create a workflow file and implement this as an action on your repo.


## Usage

You need to add a workflow file into your repository under
[.github/workflows](./.github/workflows), just like any other Github Action.
This workflow file [follows the standard workflow syntax for Github Actions.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

A sample workflow file for you to use as a drop-in is in [sample_workflow.yml](./sample_workflow.yml).

For a list of options and their description, see [action.yml](./action.yml).

Here\'s an abbreviated example with just the step for this action:

```yaml
```

**NOTE:** For stability, you should use the action with either an
explicit tag, or commit SHA:

`uses: aws-actions/stale-issue-cleanup@v3`

116,"# GitHub Action for GitHub Push

The GitHub Actions for pushing to GitHub repository local changes authorizing using GitHub token.

With ease:

- update new code placed in the repository, e.g. by running a linter on it,
- track changes in script results using Git as archive,
- publish page using GitHub-Pages,
- mirror changes to a separate repository.

## Usage

### Example Workflow file

An example workflow to authenticate with GitHub Platform and to push the changes to a specified reference, e.g. an already available branch:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to use the branch parameter to push the changes to a specified branch e.g. a Pull Request branch:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to use the force-with-lease parameter to force push to a repository:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to use the non default token push to another repository. Be aware that the force-with-lease flag is in such a case not possible:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to update/ overwrite an existing tag:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to authenticate with GitHub Platform via Deploy Keys or in general SSH:

```yaml
```

An example workflow to push to a protected branch inside your own repository. Be aware that it\'s necessary to use a personal access token, and maybe it is a good idea to specify the force-with-lease flag in case of sync and push errors:

```yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

Please be aware, if your job fails and the corresponding output log looks like the following error, update your used version of the action to `ad-m/github-push-action@master` and check the used version of the `checkout` action (v2 is required):
```log
```

If you see the following error inside the output of the job, and you want to update an existing Tag:
```log
```

Please use the `force` instead the `force_with_lease` parameter. The update of the tag is with the `--force-with-lease` parameter not possible.

> The GitHub Action for committing files for the 80% use case.

<a href=""https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/actions?query=workflow%3Atests"">
    <img src=""https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/workflows/tests/badge.svg"" alt="""">
</a>

A GitHub Action to detect changed files during a Workflow run and to commit and push them back to the GitHub repository.
By default, the commit is made in the name of ""GitHub Actions"" and co-authored by the user that made the last commit.

If you want to learn more how this Action works under the hood, check out [this article](https://michaelheap.com/git-auto-commit/) by Michael Heap.

## Usage

Adding git-auto-commit to your Workflow only takes a couple lines of code.

1. Set the `contents`-permission of the default GITHUB_TOKEN to `true`. (Required to push new commits to the repository)
2. Add the following step at the end of your job, after other steps that might add or change files.

```yaml
```

Your Workflow should look similar to this example.

```yaml
name: Format

on: push

jobs:
  format-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the
      # added or changed files to the repository.
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Other steps that change files in the repository

      # Commit all changed files back to the repository
      ```

> **Note**  
> The Action has to be used in a Job that runs on a UNIX system (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`).

The following is an extended example with all available options.

```yaml

    # Optional. Commit message for the created commit.
    # Defaults to ""Apply automatic changes""
    commit_message: Automated Change

    # Details: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html
    disable_globbing: true

    # Optional. Create given branch name in local and remote repository.
    create_branch: true
```

Please note that the Action depends on `bash`. If you\'re using the Action in a job in combination with a custom Docker container, make sure that `bash` is installed.

## Example Workflow

In this example, we\'re running `php-cs-fixer` in a PHP project to fix the codestyle automatically, then commit possible changed files back to the repository.

Note that we explicitly specify `${{ github.head_ref }}` in the checkout Action.
This is required in order to work with the `pull_request` event (or any other non-`push` event).

```yaml
name: php-cs-fixer

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  php-cs-fixer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the changed files back to the repository.
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}

    - name: Run php-cs-fixer
      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga

          with:
        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes
```

## Inputs

Checkout [`action.yml`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/blob/master/action.yml) for a full list of supported inputs.

## Outputs

You can use these outputs to trigger other Actions in your Workflow run based on the result of `git-auto-commit-action`.

- `changes_detected`: Returns either ""true"" or ""false"" if the repository was dirty and files have changed.
- `commit_hash`: Returns the full hash of the commit if one was created.

### Example

```yaml
```

## Limitations & Gotchas

The goal of this Action is to be ""the Action for committing files for the 80% use case"". Therefore, you might run into issues if your Workflow falls into the not supported 20% portion.

The following is a list of edge cases the Action knowingly does not support:

**No `git pull` when the repository is out of date with remote.** The Action will not do a `git pull` before doing the `git push`. **You** are responsible for keeping the repository up to date in your Workflow runs. 

**No support for running the Action in build matrices**. If your Workflow is using build matrices, and you want that each job commits and pushes files to the remote, you will run into the issue, that the repository in the workflow will become out of date. As the Action will not do a `git pull` for you, you have to do that yourself.

**No support for `git rebase` or `git merge`**. There are many strategies on how to integrate remote upstream changes to a local repository. `git-auto-commit` does not want to be responsible for doing that. 

**No support for detecting line break changes between CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed)**. This is a low level issue, you have to resolve differently in your project. Sorry.

If this Action doesn\'t work for your workflow, check out [EndBug/add-and-commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit).

### Checkout the correct branch

You must use `action/checkout@v2` or later versions to check out the repository.
In non-`push` events, such as `pull_request`, make sure to specify the `ref` to check out:

```yaml
```

Do this to avoid checking out the repository in a detached state.

### Commits made by this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs

The resulting commit **will not trigger** another GitHub Actions Workflow run.
This is due to [limitations set by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow).

> When you use the repository\'s GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.

You can change this by creating a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new),
storing the token as a secret in your repository and then passing the new token to the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) Action step.

```yaml
```

If you create a personal access token, apply the `repo` and `workflow` scopes.

If you work in an organization and don\'t want to create a PAT from your personal account, we recommend using a [robot account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts) for the token.

### Change to file is not detected

Does your workflow change a file, but ""git-auto-commit"" does not detect the change? Check the `.gitignore` that applies to the respective file. You might have accidentally marked the file to be ignored by git.

## Advanced Uses

### Multiline Commit Messages

If your commit message should span multiple lines, you have to create a separate step to generate the string. 

The example below can be used as a starting point to generate a multiline commit meesage. Learn more how multiline strings in GitHub Actions work in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#multiline-strings).

```yaml
    # Building a multiline commit message
    # Adjust to your liking
    - run: echo ""Commit Message 1"" >> commitmessage.txt
    - run: echo ""Commit Message 2"" >> commitmessage.txt
    - run: echo ""Commit Message 3"" >> commitmessage.txt

    # Create a multiline string to be used by the git-auto-commit Action
    - name: Set commit message
      id: commit_message_step
      run: |
        echo \'commit_message<<EOF\' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        cat commitmessage.txt >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo \'EOF\' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

    # Quick and dirty step to get rid of the temporary file holding the commit message
    - run: rm -rf commitmessage.txt

          id: commit
      with:
        commit_message: ${{ steps.commit_message_step.outputs.commit_message }}
```  

### Signing Commits & Other Git Command Line Options

Using command lines options needs to be done manually for each workflow which you require the option enabled. So for example signing commits requires you to import the gpg signature each and every time. The following list of actions are worth checking out if you need to automate these tasks regularly.

### Push to forks from private repositories

By default, GitHub Actions doesn\'t run Workflows on forks from private repositories. To enable Actions for **private** repositories enable ""Run workflows from pull requests"" in your repository settings.

See [this announcement from GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/) or the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) for details.


### Use in forks from public repositories

> **Note**   
> This Action technically works with forks. However, please note that the combination of triggers and their options can cause issues. Please read [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) on which triggers GitHub Actions support.\\
> Ensure your contributors enable ""Allow edits by maintainers"" when opening a pull request. ([Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)) \\
> \\
> **If you use this Action in combination with a linter/fixer, it\'s easier if you run the Action on `push` on your `main`-branch.**

> **Warning**   
> Due to limitations of GitHub, this Action currently can\'t push commits to a base repository, if the fork _lives_ under an organisation. See [github/community#6634](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/5634) and [this comment](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/211#issuecomment-1428849944) for details.

By default, this Action will not run on Pull Requests which have been opened by forks. (This is a limitation by GitHub, not by us.)   
However, there are a couple of ways to use this Actions in Workflows that should be triggered by forked repositories.

### Workflow should run in **base** repository

The workflow below runs whenever a commit is pushed to the `main`-branch or when activity on a pull request happens, by listening to the  [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event.

If the workflow is triggered by the `pull_request_target`-event, the workflow will run in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, as the `pull_request` event does.
In other words, this will allow your workflow to be run in the repository where the pull request is opened to and will push changes back to the fork.

Check out the discussion in [#211](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/211) for more information on this.

```yaml
name: Format PHP

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request_target:

jobs:
  php-cs-fixer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        # Checkout the fork/head-repository and push changes to the fork.
        # If you skip this, the base repository will be checked out and changes
        # will be committed to the base repository!
        repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}

        # Checkout the branch made in the fork. Will automatically push changes
        # back to this branch.
        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}

    - name: Run php-cs-fixer
      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga

    ```

### Workflow should run in **forked** repository

> **Warning**   
> **This part of the documentation is outdated.**   
> We were not able to configure a GitHub Action workflow for forks, that the workflow would run in the fork / head repository.
> Please let us know in the [discussions](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/discussions)-area, if and how you achieved that.

If the workflow should run in the forked repository, follow these steps:

1. In addition to listening to the `pull_request` event in your Workflow triggers, you have to add an additional event: `pull_request_target`. You can learn more about this event in [the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).
2. GitHub Action has to be enabled on the forked repository. \\
For security reasons, GitHub does not automatically enable GitHub Actions on forks. The user has to explicitly enable GitHub Actions in the ""Actions""-tab of the forked repository. (Mention this in your projects README or CONTRIBUTING.md!)

After you have added the `pull_request_target` to your desired Workflow and the forked repository has enabled Actions and a new Pull Request is opened, the Workflow will run **on the forked repository**.

Due to the fact that the Workflow is not run on the repository the Pull Request is opened in, you won\'t see any status indicators inside the Pull Request.

#### Example

The following workflow runs `php-cs-fixer` (a code linter and fixer for PHP) when a `pull_request` is opened. We\'ve added the `pull_request_target`-trigger too, to make it work for forks.

```yaml
name: Format PHP

on: [push, pull_request, pull_request_target]

jobs:
  php-cs-fixer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run php-cs-fixer
      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga

          with:
        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes
```

Next time a user forks your project **and** enabled GitHub Actions **and** opened a Pull Request, the Workflow will run on the **forked** repository and will push commits to the same branch.

Here\'s how the Pull Request will look like:

![Screenshot of a Pull Request from a Fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1080923/90955964-9c74c080-e482-11ea-8097-aa7f5161f50e.png)


As you can see, your contributors have to go through hoops to make this work. **For Workflows which run linters and fixers (like the example above) we recommend running them when a push happens on the `main`-branch.**


For more information about running Actions on forks, see [this announcement from GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/).

</details>

### Using `--amend` and `--no-edit` as commit options

<details>
<summary>Expand to learn more</summary>

If you would like to use this Action to create a commit using [`--amend`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend) and [`--no-edit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---no-edit) you need to make some adjustments.

> **Warning**   
> You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend a commit that has already been published. [See rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_recovering_from_upstream_rebase).

First, you need to extract the previous commit message by using `git log -1 --pretty=%s`.
Then you need to provide this last commit message to the Action through the `commit_message` input option.

Finally, you have to use `push_options: \'--force\'` to overwrite the git history on the GitHub remote repository. (git-auto-commit will not do a `git-rebase` for you!)

The steps in your workflow might look like this:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@master
  with:
    # Fetch the last 2 commits instead of just 1. (Fetching just 1 commit would overwrite the whole history)
    fetch-depth: 2

# Other steps in your workflow to trigger a changed file

- name: Get last commit message
  id: last-commit-message
  run: |
    echo ""msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%s)"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  with:
    commit_message: ${{ steps.last-commit-message.outputs.msg }}
    commit_options: \'--amend --no-edit\'
    push_options: \'--force\'
    skip_fetch: true
```

See discussion in [#159](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/159#issuecomment-845347950) for details.

</details>

## Troubleshooting
### Action does not push commit to repository

Make sure to [checkout the correct branch](#checkout-the-correct-branch).

### Action does not push commit to repository: Authentication Issue

If your Workflow can\'t push the commit to the repository because of authentication issues,
please update your Workflow configuration and usage of [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).

Updating the `token` value with a Personal Access Token should fix your issues.

### Push to protected branches

If your repository uses [protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-protected-branches) you have to make some changes to your Workflow for the Action to work properly: You need a Personal Access Token and you either have to allow force pushes or the Personal Access Token needs to belong to an Administrator.

First, you have to create a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new),
store the token as a secret in your repository and pass the new token to the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) Action step.

```yaml
```
You can learn more about Personal Access Token in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

> **Note**
> If you\'re working in an organisation, and you don\'t want to create the PAT from your personal account, we recommend using a bot-account for such tokens.


If you go the ""force pushes"" route, you have to enable force pushes to a protected branch (See [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-force-pushes-to-a-protected-branch)) and update your Workflow to use force push like this.

```yaml
          with:
        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes
        push_options: --force
```

### No new workflows are triggered by the commit of this action

This is due to limitations set up by GitHub, [commits made by this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs](#commits-made-by-this-action-do-not-trigger-new-workflow-runs).

### Pathspec \'x\' did not match any files

If you\'re using the Action with a custom `file_pattern` and the Action throws a fatal error with the message ""Pathspec \'file-pattern\' did not match any files"", the problem is probably that no file for the pattern exists in the repository.

`file_pattern` is used both for `git-status` and `git-add` in this Action. `git-add` will throw a fatal error, if for example, you use a file pattern like `*.js *.ts` but no `*.ts` files exist in your projects\' repository.

See [Issue #227](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/227) for details.

### Custom `file_pattern`, changed files but seeing ""Working tree clean. Nothing to commit."" in the logs

If you\'re using a custom `file_pattern` and the Action does not detect the changes made in your worfklow, you\'re probably running into a globbing issue.

Let\'s imagine you use `file_pattern: \'*.md\'` to detect and commit changes to all Markdown files in your repository.
If your Workflow now only updates `.md`-files in a subdirectory, but you have an untouched `.md`-file in the root of the repository, the git-auto-commit Action will display ""Working tree clean. Nothing to commit."" in the Workflow log.

This is due to the fact, that the `*.md`-glob is expanded before sending it to `git-status`. `git-status` will receive the filename of your untouched `.md`-file in the root of the repository and won\'t detect any changes; and therefore the Action does nothing.

To fix this add `disable_globbing: true` to your Workflow.

```yaml
  with:
    file_pattern: \'*.md\'
    disable_globbing: true
```

See [Issue #239](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/239) for details.

## Running the tests

The Action has tests written in [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core). Before you can run the test suite locally, you have to install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
```

You can run the test suite with `npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
```

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/tags).

We also provide major version tags to make it easier to always use the latest release of a major version. For example, you can use `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4` to always use the latest release of the current major version.
(More information about this [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#versioning-your-action).)

119,"# Issue Manager

Automatically close issues or Pull Requests that have a **label**, after a **custom delay**, if no one replies back.

## How to use

Install this GitHub action by creating a file in your repo at `.github/workflows/issue-manager.yml`.

A minimal example could be:

```yml
```

Then, you can answer an issue or PR and add the label from the config, in this case, `answered`.

After 10 days, if no one has added a new comment, the GitHub action will write:

```markdown
```

And then it will close the issue.

But if someone adds a comment _after_ you added the label, this GitHub Action will remove the label so that you can come back and check it instead of closing it.

## Config

You can use any file name you want, `issue-manager.yml` is just a suggestion. But it has to be inside of `.github/workflows/` and have a `.yml` extension.

If you check, the `config` in that file `issue-manager.yml` above has a `string`, and inside the string there\'s a whole JSON configuration:

```JSON
```

...but it\'s all inside a `string`:

```YAML
```

This JSON configuration (inside a string) is what allows us to add multiple custom labels, with different delays, and different messages.

Imagine this JSON config:

```JSON
```

In this case, if:

* the issue has a label `answered`
* the label was added _after_ the last comment
* the last comment was written more than 3 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes and 5 seconds ago

...the GitHub action would close the issue with a message of:

```markdown
```

But if there was a new comment created _after_ the label was added, by default, it would remove the label.

---

But then, if:

* the issue has a label `validated`
* the label was added _after_ the last comment
* the last comment was written more than `300` seconds ago (5 minutes)

...the GitHub action would close the issue with a message:

```markdown
```

And also, if there was a new comment created _after_ the label was added, by default, it would remove the label.

---

Then, if:

* the issue has a label `waiting`
* the label was added _after_ the last comment
* the last comment was addded more than `691200` seconds (8 days) ago

...the GitHub action would close the issue with:

```markdown
```

And again, by default, removing the label if there was a new comment written after adding the label.

---

And finally, if:

* a PR has a label `needs-tests`
* the label was added _after_ the last comment
* the last comment was addded more than `691200` seconds (8 days) ago

...the GitHub action would close the PR with:

```markdown
```

**Note**: in this last example the process is applied to a PR instead of an issue. The same logic applies to both issues and PRs. If you want a label to only apply to issues, you should use that label only with issues, and the same with PRs.

### Delay

The delay can be configured using [anything supported by Pydantic\'s `datetime`](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#datetime-types).

So, it can be an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) period format (like `P3DT12H30M5S`), or the number of seconds between the two dates (like `691200`, or 10 days) plus other options.

### Remove label on comment

You can also pass a config `remove_label_on_comment` per keyword. By default, it\'s `true`.

When someone adds a comment _after_ the label was added, then this GitHub action won\'t close the issue.

On top of not closing the issue, by default, it will remove the label. You can disable removing the label by setting `remove_label_on_comment` to `false`.

### Remove label on close

After this GitHub action closes an issue it can also automatically remove the label from the issue when you pass the config `remove_label_on_close` set to `true`.

By default it is false, and doesn\'t remove the label from the issue.

### Defaults

By default, any config has:

* `delay`: A delay of 10 days.
* `message`: A message of:

```markdown
```

* `remove_label_on_comment`: True. If someone adds a comment after you added the label, it will remove the label from the issue.
* `remove_label_on_close`: False. After this GitHub action closes the issue it would also remove the label from the issue.

### Config in the action

To use that same JSON config from above, you would have to put it on a single `string` inside the GitHub Action config (`issue-manager.yml`).

But YAML supports multiline strings using `>`.

Just make sure to indent everything to be part of the same string.

So, you can put all the config with:

```yml
```

### Edit your own config

If you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or another modern editor, you can create your JSON config by creating a JSON file, e.g. `config.json`.

Then writing the contents of your config in that file, and then copying the results.

But you can do it all with autocomplete :rocket:.

You can start your JSON config file with:

```JSON
```

And then after you write a keyword and start its config, like `""answered"": {}`, it will autocomplete the internal config keys, like `delay`, `message`. And will validate its contents.

It\'s fine to leave the `$schema` in the `config` on the `.yml` file, it will be discarded and won\'t be used as a label.

### A complete example

**Note**: you probably don\'t need all the configs, the examples above should suffice for most cases. But if you want to make the GitHub action _not_ remove the labels if someone adds a new comment, this can help as an example:

```yml
```

## GitHub Action triggers

If you check the examples above, they have a section that says when to run the GitHub action:

```yml
```

* The `cron` option means that the GitHub action will be run every day at 00:00 UTC.
* The `issue_comment` option means that it will be run with a specific issue when a comment is added.
    * This way, if there\'s a new comment, it can immediately remove any label that was added before the new comment.
* The `issues` option with a type of `label` will run it with each specific issue when you add a label.
    * This way you can add a label to an issue that was answered long ago, and if the configured delay since the last comment is enough the GitHub action will close the issue right away.
* The `pull_request_target` option with a type of `label` will run it with each specific Pull Request made to your repo when you add a label.
    * This way you can add a label to a PR that was answered long ago, or that was waiting for more comments from the author, etc. And if the configured delay since the last comment is enough the GitHub action will close the issue right away.
* The `workflow_dispatch` option allows you to run the action manually from the GitHub Actions tab for your repo.

## Motivation

### Closing early

When I answer an issue, I like to give the original user some time to respond and give them the chance to close the issue before doing it myself.

Or sometimes, I have to request additional info.

Sometimes, my answer didn\'t respond the real question/problem, and if I closed the issue immediately, it would end up feeling ""impolite"" to the user.

Moreover, if I closed the issue prematurely, there\'s a smaller chance that I (or someone else) will revisit it again to answer the real question/problem.

### Not closing

But then, if I leave the issue open after giving an answer, in many cases, the issue will keep open until I come back to close it, after many days.

Then, after that time (10 days, 30 days) and after seeing that there are no new comments, I write ""I assume the problem is solved, closing this issue now"".

But that requires me going through all the open issues again, one by one, check where I (or someone else) have already answered, typing that message, etc.

## Alternatives

One option would be to use a tool that closes stale issues, like [probot/stale](https://github.com/probot/stale), or the [Close Stale Issues Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues).

But if the user came back explaining that my answer didn\'t respond to his/her problem or giving the extra info requested, but I couldn\'t respond on time, the issue would still go ""stale"" and be closed.

## What Issue Manager does

This action allows the repo owner to add a label (e.g. `answered`) to an issue after answering. Or multiple labels with multiple configurations (multiple messages, delays, etc).

Then, this action, by running every night (or however you configure it) will, for each open issue:

* Check if the issue has one of the configured labels.
* Check if the label was added _after_ the last comment.
* If not, remove the label (configurable).
* Check if the current date-time is more than the configured *delay* to wait for the user to reply back (configurable).
* Then, if all that matches, it will add a comment with a message (configurable).
* And then it will close the issue.

It will also run after each comment or label added, with the specific issue that has the new comment or label (if you used the example configurations from above).

123,"# GitHub Action for Creating a Release on Tag push

Creates a new GitHub release whenever a tag is pushed.

## Example Usage

The following basic workflow will create a release whenever any tag is pushed that matches the version_regex.

```yaml
```

### Limiting versions and creating pre-releases

If only certain tags should create releases or some releases should be created as pre-release you can set regular expression to achieve this.
These regular expression are evaluated with GNU grep, so these regular expressions need to be compatible with it.
Regular expressions containing `\\` need them to be escaped with `\\\\`.

- `version_regex` Regular expression to verify that the version is in a correct format. Defaults to `.*` (accept everything).
- `prerelease_regex` Any version matching this regular expression will be marked as pre-release. Disabled by default.

```yaml
```

### Passing a tag to not rely on manual tag pushes

If you want to create a tag automatically and create the release in the same workflow you can set `created_tag` to achieve this.
This allows you to create a fully automated release in one workflow file (workaround because one workflow/action can not trigger another workflow/action).  
The example below uses `K-Phoen/semver-release-action` to create the tag whenever a pull request is closed, merged, and the head_ref starts with RC.
After the tag is created it is passed to the create-release-action via the CREATED_TAG env variable using the output of the `semver-release-action`.

```yaml
```

### Using the tag message as release body

If you have tag messages that you want to use as a release body you can pass them from the workflow with the `release_text` parameter.

```yaml
```

### Change log parsing

This action makes it possible to extract the release description from a Markdown change log.

By default, the `CHANGELOG.md` file is searched for a `##` (h2) heading matching the tag text.

If it is found the section is passed as body to the release API.

If for example we release the tag `v1.0.0` with a `CHANGELOG.md` as follows:

```Markdown
```

Then the text `Initial Release` will be passed as body.
Markdown restrictions for release bodies still apply.

_Parsed change logs with will have the new lines (/r, /n) and percent symbols (%) escaped._

## Inputs

### `version_regex`

Regular expression to verify that the version is in a correct format. Defaults to `.*` (accept everything).

### `prerelease_regex`

Any version matching this regular expression will be marked as pre-release. Disabled by default.

### `create_draft`

Create the releases as draft (`true|false [default: false]`). Existing will not be updated from released to draft.

### `update_existing`

Controls whether an existing release should be updated with data from the latest push (`true|false [default: false]`).

### `created_tag`

Allows to pass an already created tag.

### `release_title`

Allows to pass a release title.

### `changelog_file`

File that contains the Markdown formatted change log. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md`.

### `changelog_heading`

Heading level at which the tag headings exist. Defaults to `h2`, this parses headings at the markdown level `##`.

## Outputs

### `id`

ID number of the created or updated release.

### `html_url`

HTML access URL for the created or updated release.

### `upload_url`

Artifact upload URL for the created or updated release.

### `changelog`

Text of the parsed change log entry.

126,"# Cake for GitHub Actions

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cake-build/cake-action?label=Marketplace&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cake-action) [![GitHub Actions Build](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/actions?workflow=Build) [![GitHub Actions Tests](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/actions?workflow=Tests) [![Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cake-build/cake-action/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/cake-build/cake-action?branch=master)

This action allows you to run a Cake script from your GitHub Actions workflow without having to use a [bootstrapper](https://github.com/cake-build/resources).

## Usage

Using the Cake action from a GitHub Actions workflow is as simple as referencing [this repository](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action) from a [build step](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):

```yml
```

The Cake action will look for a script named `build.cake` in your repository's root directory and run it for you using the [Cake Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/). All output from the Cake script will be automatically redirected to the build log for inspection.

## Inputs

### `script-path`

If your script is in another location, you can specify the path with the `script-path` [input parameter](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith):

```yml
    with:
      script-path: path/to/script.cake
```

### `target`

You'll likely want to specify which task to run out of the ones defined in the Cake script. For that, you can use the `target` parameter:

```yml
    with:
      target: Task-To-Run
```

### `verbosity`

You can adjust the amount of information Cake sends to the build log by changing the [verbosity level](https://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Core.Diagnostics/Verbosity/) with the `verbosity` parameter:

```yml
    with:
      verbosity: Diagnostic
```

The supported verbosity levels are `Quiet`, `Minimal`, `Normal`, `Verbose` and `Diagnostic`. The default level is set to `Normal`.

### `dry-run`

While developing a script, you'll sometimes want to see which tasks would be triggered by a given target _without_ actually running them. That's exactly what the `dry-run` parameter is for:

```yml
    with:
      dry-run: true
```

When `dry-run` is set to `true`, Cake will print out the names of the tasks to run according to the dependency graph, but it won't perform any of the instructions defined in them.

### `arguments`

If your script defines any custom parameters, you can specify arguments for them by using the `arguments` parameter:

```yml
    with:
      arguments: |
        name: value
        configuration: Release
```

The arguments are defined in a [multi-line string literal](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688) where each argument is on a separate line in the format `name: value`. Keep in mind that the values you specify here are passed _as is_ to the Cake script; this means that characters like quotes are kept intact (for example, `name: 'value'` will result in `--name='value'` being passed to the script).

### `cake-version`

By default, the Cake action will run your script using the latest _stable_ version of the [Cake .NET Core Global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/). However, if for some reason you want to [use a specific version of Cake](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version) (for compatibility with older third-party addins, for example), you can do so by specifying the version number in the `cake-version` parameter:

```yml
    with:
      cake-version: 0.30.0
```

If you're pinning your Cake version using a [tool manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-local-tool), then you can have the action restore any local tools, including Cake, by specifying `tool-manifest` as the argument for `cake-version`:

```yml
    with:
      cake-version: tool-manifest
```

### `cake-bootstrap`

As of [Cake 1.0.0](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/releases/tag/v1.0.0), any [custom modules](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/modules) that you reference in your script are [bootstrapped automatically](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/2833) upon running it.

If you're using an older version of Cake, however, you need to explicitly [bootstrap](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/preprocessor-directives#module-directive) them before running the script. The Cake action can take care of this extra step for you by setting the `cake-bootstrap` parameter to `explicit`:

```yml
```

If you're using Cake 1.0.0 or later and wish to opt out of the automatic bootstrapping of modules, you can do so by setting the `cake-bootstrap` parameter to `skip`:

```yml
```

The default value is `auto`, which means that the modules will be automatically bootstrapped on Cake 1.0.0 or later.

## Cross-platform

Since the [Cake Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/) is built on .NET Core, the Cake action will run on any of the [virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions) supported by GitHub Actions, namely Linux, Windows and macOS.

This allows you to define your build step exactly _once_ and run it on multiple operating systems _in parallel_ by defining a [build matrix](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix):

```yml
```

You can read more about how to define a build matrix in the [workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy) for GitHub Actions.

Hey, there! \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b

This project is done in terms of features. If the project is severely broken due to a change in GitHub or RuboCop, it will be archived at that time and left to those that care about it to fork, fix, and maintain.

I will be happy to review your pull request, but will not be adding any more myself, and make no guarantees I will accept anything that adds behavior. Please read the [introduction](#introduction) for my thoughts on why you should not use this action.

This being said, I will be happy to give you contributor access if you\'re interested in becoming a maintainer. If I don\'t respond within a day or two through issues, you may email me (for this reason **only**) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes). Truthfully this project makes me feel very burnt out whenever I am around it, especially since I have not actually used it in months.

Thanks for understanding,

# RuboCop Linter Action

RuboCop Linter Action is a GitHub Action to run [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) against your Ruby codebase and output the results in the [GitHub Checks UI](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-07-new-checks-api-public-beta/).

> IMPORTANT: The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.

This is straight out of [GitHub\'s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#create-a-check-run).

Put simply, **this action will not work on pull requests from a forked repository**, making it basically useless for open source repositories.

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ACTION**, and instead follow [the Rails way](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4a78dcb326e57b5035c4df322e31875bfa74ae23/.github/workflows/rubocop.yml#L1).

## Quickstart

> IMPORTANT: This action does not run `bundle install` by default. In order to install gems via bundler, you will need to update your configuration file. See more below.

The default usage, similar to running `gem install rubocop && rubocop` from your command line:

```yaml
```

## Introduction

This GitHub Action provides a way to easily run RuboCop on your codebase, and output the results to the view via [GitHub Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks)

While it is **recommended** to write a custom GitHub Action to run RuboCop on your codebase, this action takes that functionality one step further using Checks. After the RuboCop Linter Action runs RuboCop against your Ruby code, it will create annotations that you can easily view in the GitHub UI, matched up with the offending code.

At this point the Checks API has been in beta over two years, and it is still possible that there will be breaking API changes that affect this action. If this occurs, please open a pull request to fix it.

**Are you sure you need this action?**

I would truly recommend **not** using this action. The potential for random breaking changes from GitHub will always be a looming threat and I have ascertained people are using this action as a crutch to avoid what they really ought be doing.

If you find yourself constantly having to wade through RuboCop errors in GitHub, the fix is to not allow them to get to GitHub broken in the first place. I would highly suggest using a tool like [lefthook](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook) or similar to flag or fix failing cops before they get to GitHub Actions, saving you and your team time and removing the need for this action.

### Configuration

### Inputs

**`action_config_path`**

**Defintion**

The only input accepted for the action, which allows you to specify a custom location for the action config file.

**Default**

`.github/config/rubocop_linter_action.yml`

### Simple Config

This is simple config file showing how you could choose to change the version numbers, but use defaults for the rest:

```yml
```

### Default Config

```yml
```

### Version Constraints

It is **highly** recommend you tie yourself to a version and do not do the following. I promise your life will be much easier. \xf0\x9f\x98\x87

```yml
```

### Spec

```yml
```

### Usage

```yml
```

### Example Workflow

Here is an example workflow file incorporating RuboCop Linter Action with customized usage based on the values in your configuration file:

```yaml
```

### Updates

Since the action will default to the latest RuboCop release, you may run into isues with outdated config options that are specified in your `.rubocop.yml`. To easily upgrade your config, use [mry](https://github.com/pocke/mry).

### RuboCop Docs

Several of the config options map directly to RuboCop\'s inputs. Check [their documentation](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage/#command-line-flags) for help or more info.

### FAQ

_If you cannot find an answer here that you think should be included, let us know!!_

**1. Why is my check result being shown under the wrong header?**

There is a bug with Checks that might cause your runs to get jumbled in the UI, but they will all still run and render annotations in the diff correctly. Hopefully this will get fixed or we figure out that we are doing something wrong that is fixable.

**2. How come I can\'t create checks on forked repositories? [(example)](https://github.com/ruby/spec/commit/1cfa9f188e8342993d149807210b6777189cfe3f/checks?check_suite_id=335929828)**

> NOTE: The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.

This is straight out of GitHub\'s documentation. Put simply, this action won\'t work correctly on pull requests from a forked repository as is.

I am open to a PR that will just output the results of the RuboCop run to the actions log if someone would like to take a shot at adding that!

**3. The modified flag is not working!**

If you specify the following in your config file:

```yaml
```

Please note that this will not work on commits to master. If you have an idea on how to make this work, please open an issue or PR!

**4. My GitHub Checks results don\'t match the output of running RuboCop locally.**

Make sure you\'re running the same version of RuboCop that the linter is using. If using Bundler, try running `bundle update rubocop`. If you need the linter to use an older version, you can specify it in the config file:

```yaml
```

## Config options

### exit_on_failure

Stop the workflow execution if the linter returns some failures.

```yaml
```

```

## Mandatory Arguments

`name` is the name of the image you would like to push  
`username` the login username for the registry  
`password` the authentication token [preferred] or login password for the registry.

If you would like to publish the image to other registries, these actions might be helpful  

| Registry                                             | Action                                        |

| Google Cloud Container Registry                      | https://github.com/elgohr/gcloud-login-action |

## Outputs

`tag` is the tag, which was pushed  
`snapshot-tag` is the tag that is generated by the [snapshot-option](https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action#snapshot) and pushed  
`digest` is the digest of the image, which was pushed  

## Optional Arguments

### registry
Use `registry` for pushing to a custom registry.  

As GitHub Packages Docker registry uses a different path format to GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub. See [Configuring Docker for use with GitHub Package Registry](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-package-registry/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-package-registry#publishing-a-package) for more information.  
For publishing to GitHub Container Registry please see [Migrating to GitHub Container Registry for Docker images](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images).

If you\'re using GitHub Packages Docker or GitHub Container Registry, you might also want to use `${{ github.actor }}` as the `username`.  

```yaml
```

### snapshot
Use `snapshot` to push an additional image, which is tagged with  
`{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}{HOUR}{MINUTE}{SECOND}{first 6 digits of the git sha}`.  
The date was inserted to prevent new builds with external dependencies override older builds with the same sha.
When you would like to think about versioning images, this might be useful.  

```yaml
```

### default_branch
Use `default_branch` when you want to use a different branch than `master` as the default branch.

```yaml
```

### dockerfile
Use `dockerfile` when you would like to explicitly build a Dockerfile.  
This might be useful when you have multiple DockerImages.  

```yaml
```

### workdir
Use `workdir` when you would like to change the directory for building.

```yaml
```

### context
Use `context` when you would like to change the Docker build context.

```yaml
```

### buildargs
Use `buildargs` when you want to pass a list of environment variables as [build-args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg). Identifiers are separated by comma.   
All `buildargs` will be masked, so that they don\'t appear in the logs.  

```yaml
```

### buildoptions
Use `buildoptions` when you want to configure [options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for building.  

```yaml
```

### platforms
Use `platforms` when you would like to build for specific target architectures.  
Architectures are separated by comma.  

`docker/setup-buildx-action` must be executed before a step that contains `platforms`.

```yaml
```

### cache
Use `cache` when you have big images, that you would only like to build partially (changed layers).  
> CAUTION: Docker builds will cache non-repoducable commands, such as installing packages. If you use this option, your packages will never update. To avoid this, run this action on a schedule with caching **disabled** to rebuild the cache periodically.

```yaml
```

### no_push
Use `no_push` when you want to build an image, but not push it to a registry.

```yaml
```

### Tags

This action supports multiple options that tags are handled.  
By default a tag is pushed as `latest`.  
Furthermore, one of the following options can be used. 

#### tags
Use `tags` when you want to bring your own tags (separated by comma).  

```yaml
```

When using dynamic tag names the environment variable must be set via echo, as variables set in the environment will not auto resolve by convention.  
This example illustrates how you would push to latest along with creating a custom version tag in a release. Setting it to only run on published events will keep your tags from being filled with commit hashes and will only publish when a GitHub release is created, so if the GitHub release is 2.14 this will publish to the latest and 2.14 tags.

```yaml
```

#### tag_names
Use `tag_names` when you want to push tags/release by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/MY_TAG_NAME`).  
> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.

```yaml
```

#### tag_semver
Use `tag_semver` when you want to push tags using the semver syntax by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/v1.2.3`). This will push four
docker tags: `1.2.3`, `1.2` and `1`. A prefix \'v\' will automatically be removed.
> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.

## Example Usage

```yaml
```

Retrieved secrets are available as environment variables or outputs for subsequent steps:
```yaml
```

If your project needs a format other than env vars and step outputs, you can use additional steps to transform them into the desired format. 
For example, a common pattern is to save all the secrets in a JSON file:
```yaml
```

Which with our example would yield a file containing:
```json
```

Note that all secrets are masked so programs need to read the file themselves otherwise all values will be replaced with a `***` placeholder.


## Authentication Methods

Consider using a [Vault authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth) such as the JWT auth method with
[GitHub OIDC tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) or the AppRole auth method. You can configure which by using the `method` parameter.

### JWT with GitHub OIDC Tokens

You can configure trust between a GitHub Actions workflow
and Vault using the
[GitHub\'s OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).
Each GitHub Actions workflow receives an auto-generated OIDC token with claims
to establish the identity of the workflow.

__Vault Configuration__

<details>
<summary>Click to toggle instructions for configuring Vault.</summary>

Set up Vault with the [JWT auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#configure).
Pass the following parameters to your auth method configuration:

- `oidc_discovery_url`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- `bound_issuer`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`


Configure a [Vault role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#create-role) for the auth method.

- `role_type`: `jwt`

- `bound_audiences`: `""https://github.com/<org>""`. Update this parameter if
  you change the `aud` claim in the GitHub OIDC token via the
  `jwtGithubAudience` parameter in the action config.

- `user_claim`: Set this to a claim name (e.g., `repository`) in the
  [GitHub OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token).

- `bound_claims` OR `bound_subject`: match on [GitHub subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims).

  - For wildcard (non-exact) matches, use `bound_claims`.

     - `bound_claims_type`: `glob`

     - `bound_claims`: JSON object. Maps one or more claim names to corresponding wildcard values.
       ```json
              ```

  - For exact matches, use `bound_subject`.

    - `bound_claims_type`: `string`

    - `bound_subject`: Must exactly match the `sub` claim in the OIDC token.
      ```plaintext
            ```

</details>

__GitHub Actions Workflow__

In the GitHub Actions workflow, the workflow needs permissions to read contents
and write the ID token.

```yaml
```

In the action, provide the name of the Vault role you created to the `role` parameter.
You can optionally set the `jwtGithubAudience` parameter to change the `aud`
claim from its default.

```yaml
```

### AppRole

The [AppRole auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a pre-defined role.
Set the role ID and secret ID as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`roleId` and `secretId` parameters.

```yaml
```

### Token

For the default method of authenticating to Vault,
use a [Vault token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens).
Set the Vault token as a GitHub secret and pass
it to the `token` parameter.

```yaml
```

### GitHub

The [GitHub auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/github)
requires `read:org` permissions for authentication. The auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN`
created for projects does not have these permissions and GitHub does not allow this
token\'s permissions to be modified. A new GitHub Token secret must be created with
`read:org` permissions to use this authentication method.

Pass the GitHub token as a GitHub secret into the `githubToken` parameter.

```yaml
```

### JWT with OIDC Provider

You can configure trust between your own OIDC Provider and Vault
with the JWT auth method. Provide a `role` & `jwtPrivateKey` parameters,
additionally you can pass `jwtKeyPassword` & `jwtTtl` parameters

```yaml
```

### Kubernetes

Consider the [Kubernetes auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes)
when using self-hosted runners on Kubernetes. You must provide the `role` parameter
for the Vault role associated with the Kubernetes auth method.
You can optionally override the `kubernetesTokenPath` parameter for
custom-mounted serviceAccounts.

```yaml
```

### Userpass

The [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password.
Set the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`username` and `password` parameters.

This is not the same as ldap or okta auth methods.

```yaml
```

### Ldap

The [LDAP auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/ldap) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password inturn verfied with ldap servers.
Set the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`username` and `password` parameters.

```yaml
```

### Other Auth Methods

If any other method is specified and you provide an `authPayload`, the action will
attempt to `POST` to `auth/${method}/login` with the provided payload and parse out the client token.

## Key Syntax

The `secrets` parameter is a set of multiple secret requests separated by the `;` character.

Each secret request consists of the `path` and the `key` of the desired secret, and optionally the desired Env Var output name. 
Note that the selector is using [JSONata](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html) and certain characters in keys may need to be escaped.

```raw
```

### Simple Key

To retrieve a key `npmToken` from path `secret/data/ci` that has value `somelongtoken` from vault you could do:

```yaml
```

`vault-action` will automatically normalize the given secret selector key, and set the follow as environment variables for the following steps in the current job:

```bash
```

You can also access the secret via outputs:

```yaml
```

_**Note:** If you\'d like to only use outputs and disable automatic environment variables, you can set the `exportEnv` option to `false`._

### Set Output Variable Name

However, if you want to set it to a specific name, say `NPM_TOKEN`, you could do this instead:

```yaml
```

With that, `vault-action` will now use your requested name and output:

```bash
```

```yaml
```

### Multiple Secrets

This action can take multi-line input, so say you had your AWS keys stored in a path and wanted to retrieve both of them. You can do:

```yaml
```

## Other Secret Engines

Vault Action currently supports retrieving secrets from any engine where secrets
are retrieved via `GET` requests.  This means secret engines such as PKI are currently
not supported due to their requirement of sending parameters along with the request
(such as `common_name`).

For example, to request a secret from the `cubbyhole` secret engine:

```yaml
```

Resulting in:

```bash
```

```yaml
```

## Adding Extra Headers

If you ever need to add extra headers to the vault request, say if you need to authenticate with a firewall, all you need to do is set `extraHeaders`:

```yaml
```

This will automatically add the `x-secure-id` and `x-secure-secret` headers to every request to Vault.

## HashiCorp Cloud Platform or Vault Enterprise

If you are using [HCP Vault](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/vault)
or Vault Enterprise, you may need additional parameters in
your GitHub Actions workflow.

### Namespace

If you need to retrieve secrets from a specific Vault namespace, set the `namespace`
parameter specifying the namespace. In HCP Vault, the namespace defaults to `admin`.

```yaml
```

## Masking - Hiding Secrets from Logs

This action uses GitHub Action\'s built-in masking, so all variables will automatically be masked (aka hidden) if printed to the console or to logs.
**This only obscures secrets from output logs.** If someone has the ability to edit your workflows, then they are able to read and therefore write secrets to somewhere else just like normal GitHub Secrets.

## Normalization

To make it simpler to consume certain secrets as env vars, if no Env/Output Var Name is specified `vault-action` will replace and `.` chars with `__`, remove any other non-letter or number characters. If you\'re concerned about the result, it\'s recommended to provide an explicit Output Var Key.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this project, the following dependencies are recommended for local development:
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install dependencies, build project and run tests
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the pre-configured vault containers for acceptance tests
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to spin up the pre-configured vault containers for acceptance tests
- [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the vault-action locally

### Build

Use npm to install dependencies and build the project:

```sh
```

### Vault test instance

The Github Action needs access to a working Vault instance to function. 
Multiple docker configurations are available via the docker-compose.yml file to run containers compatible with the various acceptance test suites.

```sh
```

Instead of using one of the dockerized instance, you can also use your own local or remote Vault instance by exporting these environment variables:

```sh
```

### Running unit tests

Unit tests can be executed at any time with no dependencies or prior setup.

```sh
```

### Running acceptance tests

With a succesful build to take your local changes into account and a working Vault instance configured, you can now run acceptance tests to validate if any regressions were introduced.

```sh
```

### Running the action locally

You can use the [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) command to test your
changes locally.

Edit the ./.github/workflows/local-test.yaml file and add any steps necessary
to test your changes. You may have to additionally edit the Vault url, token
and secret path if you are not using one of the provided containerized
instances. The `local-test` job will call the ./integrationTests/e2e/setup.js
script to bootstrap your local Vault instance with secrets.

Run your feature branch locally:

```sh
```

Or use the provided make target which will also spin up a Vault container:

```sh
```

```

## Action event details
### Target event
| eventName: action | condition |
|:---|:---|
|push: *|[condition1](#condition1)|
|pull_request: \\[opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled, unlabeled]|[condition2](#condition2)|
|pull_request: \\[closed]||
|schedule, repository_dispatch, workflow_dispatch||

- The following activity types must be explicitly specified ([detail](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request))
  - `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `closed`
### Conditions
#### condition1
- push to branch (not tag)
  - branch name ([`TARGET_BRANCH_PREFIX`](#options))
#### condition2
- specified labels included? ([`INCLUDE_LABELS`](#options))
- branch name ([`TARGET_BRANCH_PREFIX`](#options))

## Addition
### GITHUB_TOKEN
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` that is provided as a part of `GitHub Actions` doesn\'t have authorization to create any successive events.  
So it won\'t spawn actions which triggered by push.  

This can be a problem if you have branch protection configured.  

If you want to trigger actions, use a personal access token instead.  
1. Generate a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with the public_repo or repo scope.  
(repo is required for private repositories).  
1. [Save as ACCESS_TOKEN](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
1. Add input to use `ACCESS_TOKEN` instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.  
   e.g. `.github/workflows/toc.yml`
   ```yaml
   on: push
   name: TOC Generator
   jobs:
     generateTOC:
       name: TOC Generator
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: technote-space/toc-generator@v4
           with:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Create PullRequest
If `CREATE_PR` is set to `true`, a PullRequest is created.  

```yaml
```

![create pr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technote-space/toc-generator/images/create_pr.png)

If the `closed` activity type is set, this action closes the PR when it is no longer needed.  

```yaml
```

### Context variables
| name | description |
|:---|:---|
| PR_NUMBER | pull_request.number (e.g. `11`) |
| PR_NUMBER_REF | `#${pull_request.number}` (e.g. `#11`) |
| PR_ID | pull_request.id (e.g. `21031067`) |
| PR_HEAD_REF | pull_request.head.ref (e.g. `change`) |
| PR_BASE_REF | pull_request.base.ref (e.g. `main`) |
| PR_MERGE_REF | pull_request.base.ref (e.g. `change -> main`) |
| PR_TITLE | pull_request.title (e.g. `update the README with new information.`) |

[Payload example](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-28)

### Context PR variables
- [Context variables](#context-variables)

| name | description |
|:---|:---|
| PR_LINK | Link to PR |
| COMMANDS_OUTPUT | Result of TOC command |
| FILES_SUMMARY | e.g. `Changed 2 files` |
| FILES | Changed file list |

## Configuration Examples
### Example 1
Execute actions at push without limiting the branch and commit directly

```yaml
```

### Example 2
Create or update a Pull Request by executing actions on a Pull Request update only for branches starting with `release/`.

```yaml
        with:
          CREATE_PR: true
          TARGET_BRANCH_PREFIX: release/
```

### Example 3
Execute actions in the schedule for the default branch only and commit directly.  
\xef\xbc\x88Using the Token created for the launch of other workflows\xef\xbc\x89

```yaml
```

### Install multiple keys

If you want to install multiple keys, call this action multiple times.
It is useful for port forwarding.

**NOTE:** When this action is called multiple times, **the contents of `known_hosts` and `config` will be appended**. `key` must be saved as different name, by using `name` option.

```yaml
```

## Q&A

### SSH failed even though key has been installed.

Check below:

* `Host key verification failed.`:
    * Set `known_hosts` parameter correctly (use `ssh-keyscan` command).

### I want to replace/ignore key if exists.

Use `if_key_exists` parameter.

* `replace`: replaces key
* `ignore`: does nothing
* `fail`: fails (default)

### How do I use encrypted SSH key?

This action doesn\'t support encrypted key directly.
Here are some solutions:

* decrypting key beforehand: best bet, and works on any VM
* `sshpass` command: next best bet, but not supported on Windows
* `expect` command: be careful not to expose passphrase to console
* `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable: might be troublesome

### Which one is the best way for transferring files, ""direct SCP/SFTP/rsync"" or ""SCP/SFTP/rsync via bastion""?

I recommend **rsync via bastion**.

```bash
```

It has some advantages over other methods:

* ""Rsync via bastion"" doesn\'t require to update workflow files and `secrets` even if it is necessary to transfer files to multiple servers.
    * Other methods require to update `known_hosts` if servers have changed.
* Rsync:
    * is fastest of all.
    * does **NOT** break files even if disconnected during transferring.
    * can remove files that don\'t exist on server.
* SCP is [deprecated by OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.0) due to outdated and inflexible protocol.
* Using bastion is more secure because:
    * it is not necessarily to expose SSH port on servers to public.
        * Address filtering is less effective.
        * Because Azure address range is [very wide](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses-of-github-hosted-runners).
        * And will be updated continuously.
    * if security incident \xe2\x80\x95e.g., private key leaked\xe2\x80\x95 occurs, it\'s OK just to remove `authorized_keys` on bastion.

### I want to omit `known_hosts`.

First of all, you have to understand that it is NOT secure to SSH with no `known_hosts` and using `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option.

Why do you want to omit it?
If the reason is **""I\'m not understanding about the function of `known_hosts`""** or **""It\'s bother to fetch server key""**, you should not omit.
If **""It is hard to prefetch server key because the server will be created dynamically""**, you can use bastion server.

**""`known_hosts` is unnecessary because I\'m using secure method for SSH, such as SSHFP and signed server key.""** \xe2\x80\x94 OK, here is a special value to omit `known_hosts`.
You should use it ONLY IF you are using secure methods...
It is `known_hosts: unnecessary`.

# Automerge Action

This action automatically enables \xe2\x80\x9cauto-merge\xe2\x80\x9d for pull requests under the following conditions:

- The pull request is not a draft.
- The associated branch has at least one required status check.
- All required labels (if any) are applied.
- No \xe2\x80\x9cdo not merge\xe2\x80\x9d labels are applied.

Ensure the following is set up in your repository settings before enabling this action:

- The **\xe2\x80\x9cRequire pull request reviews before merging\xe2\x80\x9d** rule and the additional **\xe2\x80\x9cDismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed\xe2\x80\x9d** rule
  are enabled for the branch. This ensures that no changes to the pull request are possible between the approval and the automatic merging.

- The **\xe2\x80\x9cRequire status checks to pass before merging\xe2\x80\x9d** rule is enabled and at least one status check is selected.

  Consider also adding this action as an additional required status check. Read the [Known Issues](#known-issues) section on why.

- **\xe2\x80\x9cAllow auto-merge\xe2\x80\x9d** is enabled.

## Example Workflow

```yml
```

## Known Issues

If the action is triggered via a label on a pull request that is already ready to merge, the GitHub auto-merge feature cannot be enabled on that pull request anymore. A workaround is to add the workflow containing this actions as a required status check. This way the pull request will become unmergable while the action is running, allowing auto-merge to be enabled.

After installation simply comment `/rebase` to trigger the action:

![rebase-action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/989066/51547853-14a57b00-1e35-11e9-841d-33114f0f0bd5.gif)

# Installation

To configure the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/workflows/rebase.yml` workflow file:

```yaml
```

> NOTE: To ensure GitHub Actions is automatically re-run after a successful rebase action use a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for `actions/checkout@v2` and `cirrus-actions/rebase@1.4`. See the following [discussion](https://github.community/t/triggering-a-new-workflow-from-another-workflow/16250/37) for more details.

Example

```yaml
```

You can also optionally specify the PR number of the branch to rebase,
if the action you're running doesn't directly refer to a specific
pull request:

```yaml
```


## Restricting who can call the action

It's possible to use `author_association` field of a comment to restrict who can call the action and skip the rebase for others. Simply add the following expression to the `if` statement in your workflow file: `github.event.comment.author_association == 'MEMBER'`. See [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v4/enum/commentauthorassociation/) for a list of all available values of `author_association`.

GitHub can also optionally dismiss an existing review automatically after rebase, so you'll need to re-approve again which will trigger the test workflow.
Set it up in your repository *Settings* > *Branches* > *Branch protection rules* > *Require pull request reviews before merging* > *Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed*.

A GitHub action to rebase pull requests in a repository.

## Usage

The default behaviour of the action with no configured inputs is to check the current repository for rebaseable pull requests and rebase them.
Pull requests from forks are rebaseable only if they [allow edits from maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

```yml
```

### Periodically rebase all pull requests

The simplest way to use this action is to schedule it to run periodically.

```yml
name: Rebase
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  rebase:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

### Rebase all pull requests on push to the base branch

```yml
name: Rebase
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  rebase:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        with:
          base: main
```

### Exclude pull requests with specific labels

```yml
        with:
          exclude-labels: |
            no-rebase
            dependencies
```

### Exclude pull request forks with head filter

```yml
        with:
          head: 'my-org:*'
```

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). The `workflow` scope may also be required if rebasing pull requests containing changes to workflows under `.github/workflows`. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The target GitHub repository containing the pull request. | `github.repository` (Current repository) |
| `head` | Filter pull requests by head user or head organization and branch name in the format `user:ref-name` or `organization:ref-name`. Use the `*` wildcard match any ref. e.g. `my-org:new-script-format` or `octocat:*`. | |
| `base` | Filter pull requests by base branch name. Example: `gh-pages`. | |
| `include-labels` | A comma or newline separated list of pull request labels to include. Allows any labels if unspecified. | |
| `exclude-labels` | A comma or newline separated list of pull request labels to exclude. | |
| `exclude-drafts` | Exclude draft pull requests. | `false` |

### Rebase slash command

Use the following two workflows and a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to add a `/rebase` slash command to pull request comments.
The [slash-command-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) action makes sure that the command is only executable by users with `write` access to the repository.

```yml
```

```yml
name: rebase-command
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [rebase-command]
jobs:
  rebase:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        id: rebase
        with:
          head: ${{ github.event.client_payload.pull_request.head.label }}
      - name: Add reaction
        if: steps.rebase.outputs.rebased-count == 1
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.repository.full_name }}
          comment-id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.comment.id }}
          reaction-type: hooray
```

### Target other repositories

You can rebase requests in another repository by using a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
The user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository.

This example targets multiple repositories.

```yml
name: Rebase
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  rebase:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        repo: ['my-org/repo1', 'my-org/repo2', 'my-org/repo3']
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          repository: ${{ matrix.repo }}
```

| `body` | The comment body. Cannot be used in conjunction with `body-path`. | |
| `body-path` | The path to a file containing the comment body. Cannot be used in conjunction with `body`. | |

Note: In *public* repositories this action does not work in `pull_request` workflows when triggered by forks.
Any attempt will be met with the error, `Resource not accessible by integration`.
This is due to token restrictions put in place by GitHub Actions. Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-forks-of-private-repositories) from forks to run without restriction. See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#restrictions-on-repository-forks) for further explanation. Alternatively, use the [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event to comment on pull requests.

#### Outputs

The ID of the created comment will be output for use in later steps.
Note that in order to read the step output the action step must have an id.

```yml
```

### Where to find the id of a comment

How to find the id of a comment will depend a lot on the use case.
Here is one example where the id can be found in the `github` context during an `issue_comment` event.

```yml
```

Some use cases might find the [find-comment](https://github.com/peter-evans/find-comment) action useful.
This will search an issue or pull request for the first comment containing a specified string, and/or by a specified author.
See the repository for detailed usage.

In the following example, find-comment is used to determine if a comment has already been created on a pull request.
If the find-comment action output `comment-id` returns an empty string, a new comment will be created.
If it returns a value, the comment already exists and the content is replaced.
```yml
```

If required, the create and update steps can be separated for greater control.
```yml
```

### Setting the comment body from a file

```yml
```

### Using a markdown template

In this example, a markdown template file is added to the repository at `.github/comment-template.md` with the following content.
```
```

The template is rendered using the [render-template](https://github.com/chuhlomin/render-template) action and the result is used to create the comment.
```yml
```

### Accessing issues and comments in other repositories

You can create and update comments in another repository by using a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
The user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository.

# Re-run Workflow Action

This action allows re-running a workflow when labels are added to (or removed from) a pull request.


## Inputs

| Name | Required  | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `token` | yes | A GitHub Token other than the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be specified in order to be able to re-run workflows. |
| `once-label` | no\\* | When this label is added to a pull request, re-run the `workflow` once and remove the label again. |
| `continuous-label` | no\\* | When this label is added to a pull request, continuously re-run the `workflow` until it succeeds or is cancelled. The action needs to be run on `workflow_run`, `push` or `schedule` events for this to work. |
| `trigger-labels` | no\\* | When any of the labels in this comma-separated list is added to or removed from a pull request, re-run the `workflow` once. |
| `workflow` | yes | File name or ID of the workflow which should be re-run. |

\\* At least one of `once-label`, `continuous-label` or `trigger-labels` is required.


## Example Workflow

```yml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
138,"# Automatic Pull Request Review

> \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d Github action to automate pull requests

This action allows you to use any of the `pull_request` [webhook event](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events) to automate pull request reviews. For example when a `pull request` is `opened` by `dependabot`, automatically approve it.

## Usage

1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/pull-request-automation.yml` to your project.
2. In the `pull-request-automation.yml` you have to decide which events you'll act on and the actors pull requests to automate.

_For example:_

To approve all pull requests pull requests from `dependabot`, you would add the following to the `yml` file:

```yml
```

## Workflow options

These are the options recommended to be changed. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

</div>

## What does this action do?

This action allows you to easily integrate and automate the localization of your Crowdin project into the GitHub Actions workflow.

- Upload sources to Crowdin.
- Upload translations to Crowdin.
- Downloads translations from Crowdin.
- Download sources from Crowdin.
- Creates a PR with the translations.
- Run any Crowdin CLI command.

## Usage

Set up a workflow in *.github/workflows/crowdin.yml* (or add a job to your existing workflows).

Read the [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow) article for more details on creating and setting up GitHub workflows.

```yaml
```

`secrets.GH_TOKEN` - a GitHub Personal Access Token with the `repo` scope selected (the user should have write access to the repository).

> **Note**
> In case you want to use an [automatic GitHub authentication token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication), you need to assign the [`write` permission to your job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) and [allow GH Actions to create Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests).

## Supported options

The default action is to upload sources. However, you can set different actions using the ""with"" options. If you don\'t want to upload your sources to Crowdin, just set the `upload_sources` option to false.

By default, sources and translations are being uploaded to the root of your Crowdin project. Still, if you use branches, you can set the preferred source branch.

You can also specify what GitHub branch you\xe2\x80\x99d like to download your translations to (default translation branch is `l10n_crowdin_action`).

In case you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to download translations from Crowdin (`download_translations: false`), `localization_branch_name` and `create_pull_request` options aren\'t required either.

```yaml
```

For more detailed descriptions of these options, see [`action.yml`](https://github.com/crowdin/github-action/blob/master/action.yml).

> **Note**
> The `base_url` is required For Crowdin Enterprise and should be passed in the following way: `base_url: \'https://{organization-name}.api.crowdin.com\'`

### Crowdin CLI command

You can also run any other Crowdin CLI command by specifying the `command` and `command_args` _(optional)_ options. For example:

```yaml
```

To see the full list of available commands, visit the [official documentation](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/).

### Crowdin configuration file

If your workflow file specifies the `config` property, you\'ll need to add the following to your [Crowdin configuration file](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/) (e.g. `crowdin.yml`):

```yml
```

When the workflow runs, the real values of your token and project ID will be injected into the config using the secrets in the environment.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Package for distribution

GitHub Actions will run the entry point from the action.yml. Packaging assembles the code into one file that can be checked in to Git, enabling fast and reliable execution and preventing the need to check in node_modules.

Actions are run from GitHub repos.  Packaging the action will create a packaged action in the dist folder.

Run package

```bash
```

Since the packaged index.js is run from the dist folder.

```bash
```

## Create a release branch

Users shouldn\'t consume the action from master since that would be latest code and actions can break compatibility between major versions.

Checkin to the v1 release branch

```bash
```

```bash
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Usage

You can now consume the action by referencing the v1 branch

```yaml
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

146,"# setup-ruby

This action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.

It is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.
No extra packages need to be installed.

Compared to [actions/setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby),
this actions supports many more versions and features.

### Supported Versions

This action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:

| Interpreter | Versions |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Ruby | 2.1.9, 2.2, 2.3.0 - 2.3.8, 2.4.0 - 2.4.10, 2.5.0 - 2.5.8, 2.6.0 - 2.6.6, 2.7.1, head, debug, mingw, mswin |
| JRuby | 9.1.17.0, 9.2.9.0 - 9.2.13.0, head |
| TruffleRuby | 19.3.0 - 20.2.0, head |
| Rubinius | 4.14 |

`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  
On Windows, `mingw` and `mswin` are `ruby-head` builds using the MSYS2/MinGW and the MSVC toolchains respectively.

Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows (last build from RubyInstaller) and 2.2.10 otherwise.  
Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 (same as RubyInstaller).

Note that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.3 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,
which means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.3 is unmaintained and considered insecure.
On Windows, Ruby 2.4 uses OpenSSL 1.0.2, which is no longer maintained.

### Supported Platforms

The action works for all [GitHub-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners), and [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners), under [certain conditions](#limitations)

| Operating System | Recommended | Other Supported Versions |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-latest`  (= `ubuntu-18.04`) | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-16.04` |
| macOS   | `macos-latest`   (= `macos-10.15`)  | |
| Windows | `windows-latest` (= `windows-2019`) | `windows-2016` |

Rubinius is only available on `ubuntu-18.04`.

The prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)
and on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).
`mingw` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).
`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),
`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder)
and `truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder).
The full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.js](ruby-builder-versions.js)
for Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.js](windows-versions.js) for Windows.

## Usage

### Single Job

```yaml
```

### Matrix

This matrix tests all stable releases and `head` versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby on Ubuntu and macOS.

```yaml
```

See the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the
[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
and the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Supported Version Syntax

* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`
* short version like `2.6`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.5`)
* version only like `2.6.5`, assumes MRI for the engine
* engine only like `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation
* `.ruby-version` reads from the project's `.ruby-version` file
* `.tool-versions` reads from the project's `.tool-versions` file
* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`

### Working Directory

The `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`
if they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.

### Bundler

By default, if there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` if `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` is set) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,
the latest version of Bundler with the same major version will be installed.
Otherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.4, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.4).

This behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details about the `bundler` input.

### Caching `bundle install` automatically

This action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:
```yaml
```

This caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  
It needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  
The caching works whether there is a `Gemfile.lock` or not.
If there is a `Gemfile.lock`, `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.

To perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path vendor/bundle`.  
Therefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work.

### Caching `bundle install` manually

You can also cache gems manually,
but this is not recommended because it is verbose and very difficult to use a correct cache key.
You can cache the installed gems with these two steps:

```yaml
```

When using a single OS, replace `${{ matrix.os }}` with the OS.  
When using a single job with a Ruby version, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with the Ruby version.  
When using `.ruby-version`, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with `${{ hashFiles('.ruby-version') }}`.  
When using `.tool-versions`, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with `${{ hashFiles('.tool-versions') }}`.

This uses the [cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache).
The code above is a more complete version of the [Ruby - Bundler example](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#ruby---bundler).
Make sure to include `use-ruby` in the `key` to avoid conflicting with previous caches.

## Windows

Note that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.
It is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.

* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).
* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.
* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.
* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.
* JRuby on Windows has a known bug that `bundle exec rake` [fails](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18).

## Versioning

It is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.
This will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.

If you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and
it will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.
Make sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.

This action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.
This follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.

## Using self-hosted runners
You must meet the following parameters to use this action with self-hosted runners:

* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` installed
* The runner software is running as user `runner` with a home directory of `/home/runner`, or you have created a symlink for the home directory of whatever user that the runner is running as to `/home/runner`.

## History

This action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.
Please [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.

147,"## Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions
Configure your AWS credentials and region environment variables for use in other
GitHub Actions. This action implements the AWS SDK credential resolution chain
and exports environment variables for your other Actions to use. Environment
variable exports are detected by both the AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI for AWS API
calls.

### Recent updates

**GitHub OIDC Changes**

In #[357](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/357), we
observed that GitHub recently started offering one of several intermediate OIDC
endpoint thumbprints. Because IAM requires statically configured endpoint
thumbprints, AWS customers that had only one thumbprint configured could see
intermittent authentication failures. **As of July 6, 2023, AWS has made a change to
IAM that will no longer require any particular certificate thumbprint for
tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com**, which is the GitHub OIDC endpoint. Instead,
AWS secures communication with GitHub OIDC using our library of trusted CAs rather
than using a certificate thumbprint to verify the server certificate. The IAM APIs
still require that a thumbprint is configured, but those thumbprints will be ignored
when authenticating tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com.

GitHub Enterprise Server customers use a different endpoint so they are not affected by
this change.

*Original message:*
There are now [two possible intermediary certificates](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-27-github-actions-update-on-oidc-integration-with-aws/) for the Actions SSL certificate. Previously, the certificate with the thumbprint `6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1` was guaranteed to return. Now, the certificate with the thumbprint `1c58a3a8518e8759bf075b76b750d4f2df264fcd` can also be returned, so you will need to [update your identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) with this additional new thumbprint.

## Usage
We support four methods for fetching credentials from AWS, but we recommend that
you use GitHub\'s OIDC provider in conjunction with a configured AWS IAM
Identity Provider endpoint.

To do that, you would add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
```
This will cause the action to perform an `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` call and
return temporary security credentials for use by other actions. In order for
this to work, you\'ll need to preconfigure the IAM IdP in your AWS account
(see [Assuming a Role](#assuming-a-role) for details).

You can use this action with the AWS CLI available in
[GitHub\'s hosted virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners) or run this action multiple times
to use different AWS accounts, regions, or IAM roles in the same GitHub Actions
workflow. As an example, here is a complete workflow file that uploads artifacts
to Amazon S3.

```yaml
```

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs
and outputs.

## Credentials

We recommend following
[Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
  * Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code.
  * [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions
  workflows. Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your
  GitHub Actions workflows.
  * [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Assuming a Role
There are four different supported ways to retrieve credentials. We recommend
using [GitHub\'s OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)
to get short-lived credentials needed for your actions. Specifying
`role-to-assume` **without** providing an `aws-access-key-id` or a
`web-identity-token-file`, or setting `role-chaining`, will signal to the action that you wish to use the
OIDC provider. If `role-chaining` is `true`, existing credentials in the environment will be used to assume `role-to-assume`.

The following table describes which identity is used based on which values are supplied to the Action:

| **Identity Used**                                               | `aws-access-key-id` | `role-to-assume` | `web-identity-token-file` | `role-chaining` |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | - |
| [\xe2\x9c\x85 Recommended] Assume Role directly using GitHub OIDC provider |                     | \xe2\x9c\x94                |                           | |
| IAM User                                                        | \xe2\x9c\x94                   |                  |                           | |
| Assume Role using IAM User credentials                          | \xe2\x9c\x94                   | \xe2\x9c\x94                |                           | |
| Assume Role using WebIdentity Token File credentials            |                     | \xe2\x9c\x94                | \xe2\x9c\x94                         | |
| Assume Role using existing credentials | | \xe2\x9c\x94 | | \xe2\x9c\x94 |

### Credential Lifetime
The default session duration is **1 hour** when using the OIDC provider to
directly assume an IAM Role or when an `aws-session-token` is directly provided.
The default session duration is **6 hours** when using an IAM User to assume an
IAM Role (by providing an `aws-access-key-id`, `aws-secret-access-key`, and a
`role-to-assume`) .

If you would like to adjust this you can pass a duration to `role-duration-seconds`, but the duration cannot exceed the maximum that was defined when the IAM Role was created.
The default session name is GitHubActions, and you can modify it by specifying the desired name in `role-session-name`.
The default audience is `sts.amazonaws.com` which you can replace by specifying the desired audience name in `audience`.

### Examples

#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (recommended)
```yaml
```
In this example, the Action will load the OIDC token from the GitHub-provided environment variable and use it to assume the role `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` with the session name `MySessionName`.

#### AssumeRole with static IAM credentials in repository secrets
```yaml
    - name: Configure other AWS Credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        aws-region: us-east-2
        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role
        role-session-name: MySessionName
        role-chaining: true
```
In this two-step example, the first step will use OIDC to assume the role `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` just as in the prior example. Following that, a second step will use this role to assume a different role, `arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role`.

```yaml
```
In this example, the secret `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` contains a string like `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role`.  To assume a role in the same account as the static credentials, you can simply specify the role name, like `role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role`.

#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity using a custom audience
```yaml
```
In this example, the audience has been changed from the default to use a different audience name `beta-customers`. This can help ensure that the role can only affect those AWS accounts whose GitHub OIDC providers have explicitly opted in to the `beta-customers` label.

Changing the default audience may be necessary when using non-default [AWS partitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity and disable secure Action outputs
```yaml
        mask-aws-account-id: false
```
In this example, account ID masking has been disabled. By default, the AWS
account ID will be obscured in the action\'s output. This may be helpful when
debugging action failures.

## Sample IAM OIDC CloudFormation Template
If you choose to use GitHub\'s OIDC provider, you must first set up federation
with the provider in as an IAM IdP. The GitHub OIDC provider only needs to be
created once per account (i.e. multiple IAM Roles that can be assumed by the
GitHub\'s OIDC can share a single OIDC Provider).

Note that the thumbprint has been set to all F\'s because the thumbprint is not
used when authenticating tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com. Instead, IAM
uses its library of trusted CAs to authenticate. However, this value is still
required by the API.

This CloudFormation template will configure the IdP for you. You can copy the
template below, or load it from here: 
https://d38mtn6aq9zhn6.cloudfront.net/configure-aws-credentials-latest.yml

```yaml
```

To align with the Amazon IAM best practice of
[granting least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege), the assume role policy document should contain a
[`Condition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) that specifies a subject allowed to assume the role. Without a subject
condition, any GitHub user or repository could potentially assume the role. The
subject can be scoped to a GitHub organization and repository as shown in the
CloudFormation template. Additional claim conditions can be added for higher
specificity as explained in the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).
Due to implementation details, not every OIDC claim is presently supported by
IAM.

For further information on OIDC and GitHub Actions, please see:

* [AWS docs: Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html)
* [AWS docs: IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)
* [GitHub docs: About security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)

### Session tagging
The session will have the name ""GitHubActions"" and be tagged with the following
tags: (`GITHUB_` environment variable definitions can be
[found here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables))

| Key        | Value             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| GitHub     | ""Actions""         |
| Repository | GITHUB_REPOSITORY |
| Workflow   | GITHUB_WORKFLOW   |
| Action     | GITHUB_ACTION     |
| Actor      | GITHUB_ACTOR      |
| Branch     | GITHUB_REF        |
| Commit     | GITHUB_SHA        |

_Note: all tag values must conform to
[the requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html).
Particularly, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` will be truncated if it\'s too long. If
`GITHUB_ACTOR` or `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` contain invalid characters, the characters
will be replaced with an \'*\'._

The action will use session tagging by default during role assumption. 
Note that for WebIdentity role assumption, the session tags have to be included
in the encoded WebIdentity token. This means that Tags can only be supplied by
the OIDC provider and not set during the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API call
within the Action. You can skip this session tagging by providing
`role-skip-session-tagging` as true in the action\'s inputs:
```yaml
```

### Inline session policy
An IAM policy in stringified JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.
Depending on preferences, the JSON could be written on a single line like this:
```yaml
```
Or we can have a nicely formatted JSON as well:
```yaml
```

### Managed session policies
The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies.
The policies must exist in the same account as the role. You can pass a single managed policy like this:
```yaml
```
And we can pass multiple managed policies likes this:
```yaml
```

## Self-Hosted Runners

If you run your GitHub Actions in a
[self-hosted runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) that already has access to AWS credentials, such as
an EC2 instance, then you do not need to provide IAM user access key credentials
to this action. We will use the standard AWS JavaScript SDK credential
resolution methods to find your credentials, so if the AWS JS SDK can
authenticate on your runner, this Action will as well.

If no access key credentials are given in the action inputs, this action will
use credentials from the runner environment using the
[default methods for the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).

You can use this action to simply configure the region and account ID in the
environment, and then use the runner\'s credentials for all AWS API calls made by
your Actions workflow:
```yaml
```
In this case, your runner\'s credentials must have permissions to call any AWS
APIs called by your Actions workflow.

Or, you can use this action to assume a role, and then use the role credentials
for all AWS API calls made by your Actions workflow:
```yaml
  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role
```
In this case, your runner\'s credentials must have permissions to assume the
role.

You can also assume a role using a web identity token file, such as if using
[Amazon EKS IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html). Pods running in EKS
worker nodes that do not run as root can use this file to assume a role with a
web identity.

### Proxy Configuration

If you run in self-hosted environments and in secured environment where you need
use a specific proxy you can set it in the action manually.

Additionally this action will always consider already configured proxy in the
environment.

Manually configured proxy:
```yaml
  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role
  http-proxy: ""http://companydomain.com:3128""
```

Proxy configured in the environment variable:
```bash
```

The action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment and
you don\'t need to configure it in the action.

### Use with the AWS CLI
This workflow does _not_ install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
into your environment. Self-hosted runners that intend to run this action prior
to executing `aws` commands need to have the AWS CLI
[installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
if it\'s not already present. 
Most [GitHub hosted runner environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)
should include the AWS CLI by default.

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/actions)
[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Marketplace-green)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate)

This GitHub Action offers you a direct way to interact with the host system on which the actual scripts (Actions) will run.

## Features

- Debug your GitHub Actions by using SSH or Web shell
- Continue your Workflows afterwards

## Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

## Getting Started

By using this minimal example a [tmate](https://tmate.io) session will be created.

```yaml
```

To get the connection string, just open the `Checks` tab in your Pull Request and scroll to the bottom. There you can connect either directly per SSH or via a web based terminal.

![GitHub Checks tab](./docs/checks-tab.png ""GitHub Checks tab"")

## Manually triggered debug

Instead of having to add/remove, or uncomment the required config and push commits each time you want to run your workflow with debug, you can make the debug step conditional on an optional parameter that you provide through a [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) ""manual event"".

Add the following to the `on` events of your workflow:

```yaml
```

Then add an [`if`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) condition to the debug step:

<!--
{% raw %}
-->
```yaml
```
<!--
{% endraw %}
-->

You can then [manually run a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) on the desired branch and set `debug_enabled` to true to get a debug session.

## Detached mode

By default, this Action starts a `tmate` session and waits for the session to be done (typically by way of a user connecting and exiting the shell after debugging). In detached mode, this Action will start the `tmate` session, print the connection details, and continue with the next step(s) of the workflow\'s job. At the end of the job, the Action will wait for the session to exit.

```yaml
      with:
        detached: true
```

By default, this mode will wait at the end of the job for a user to connect and then to terminate the tmate session. If no user has connected within 10 minutes after the post-job step started, it will terminate the `tmate` session and quit gracefully.

## Without sudo

By default we run installation commands using sudo on Linux. If you get `sudo: not found` you can use the parameter below to execute the commands directly.

```yaml
      with:
        sudo: false
```

## Timeout

By default the tmate session will remain open until the workflow times out. You can [specify your own timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepstimeout-minutes) in minutes if you wish to reduce GitHub Actions usage.

```yaml
      timeout-minutes: 15
```

## Only on failure
By default a failed step will cause all following steps to be skipped. You can specify that the tmate session only starts if a previous step [failed](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#failure).

```yaml
```

## Use registered public SSH key(s)

If [you have registered one or more public SSH keys with your GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), tmate will be started such that only those keys are authorized to connect, otherwise anybody can connect to the tmate session. If you want to require a public SSH key to be installed with the tmate session, no matter whether the user who started the workflow has registered any in their GitHub profile, you will need to configure the setting `limit-access-to-actor` to `true`, like so:

```yaml
      with:
        limit-access-to-actor: true
```

If the registered public SSH key is not your default private SSH key, you will need to specify the path manually, like so: `ssh -i <path-to-key> <tmate-connection-string>`.

## Use your own tmate servers

By default the tmate session uses `ssh.tmate.io`. You can use your own tmate servers. [tmate-ssh-server](https://github.com/tmate-io/tmate-ssh-server) is the server side part of tmate.

```yaml
      with:
        tmate-server-host: ssh.tmate.io
        tmate-server-port: 22
        tmate-server-rsa-fingerprint: SHA256:Hthk2T/M/Ivqfk1YYUn5ijC2Att3+UPzD7Rn72P5VWs
        tmate-server-ed25519-fingerprint: SHA256:jfttvoypkHiQYUqUCwKeqd9d1fJj/ZiQlFOHVl6E9sI
```

## Skip installing tmate

By default, tmate and its dependencies are installed in a platform-dependent manner. When using self-hosted agents, this can become unnecessary or can even break. You can skip installing tmate and its dependencies using `install-dependencies`:

```yaml
```

## Continue a workflow

If you want to continue a workflow and you are inside a tmate session, just create a empty file with the name `continue` either in the root directory or in the project directory by running `touch continue` or `sudo touch /continue`.

## Connection string / URL is not visible

The connection string will be written in the logs every 5 seconds. For more information checkout issue [#1](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/issues/1).

## Usage

In the examples below we are also using 3 other actions:

* [`setup-buildx`](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action) action will
  create and boot a builder using by default the [`docker-container` driver](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/drivers/docker-container/).
  This is **not required but recommended** using it to be able to build
  multi-platform images, export cache, etc.
* [`setup-qemu`](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action) action can be
  useful if you want to add emulation support with QEMU to be able to build
  against more platforms. 
* [`login`](https://github.com/docker/login-action) action will take care to
  log in against a Docker registry.

### Git context

By default, this action uses the [Git context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories),
so you don\'t need to use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/)
action to check out the repository as this will be done directly by [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).

The git reference will be based on the [event that triggered your workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)
and will result in the following context: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git#<ref>`.

```yaml
```

Be careful because **any file mutation in the steps that precede the build step
will be ignored, including processing of the `.dockerignore` file** since
the context is based on the Git reference. However, you can use the
[Path context](#path-context) using the [`context` input](#inputs) alongside
the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/) action to remove
this restriction.

Default Git context can also be provided using the [Handlebars template](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/)
expression `{{defaultContext}}`. Here we can use it to provide a subdirectory
to the default Git context:

```yaml
```

> **Warning**
>
> Subdirectory for Git context is available from [BuildKit v0.9.0](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.9.0).
> If you\'re using the `docker` builder (default if `setup-buildx-action` not used),
> then BuildKit in Docker Engine will be used. As Docker Engine < v22.x.x embeds
> Buildkit 0.8.2 at the moment, it does not support this feature. It\'s therefore
> required to use the `setup-buildx-action` at the moment.

Building from the current repository automatically uses the [GitHub Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication),
so it does not need to be passed. If you want to authenticate against another
private repository, you have to use a [secret](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/secrets)
named `GIT_AUTH_TOKEN` to be able to authenticate against it with Buildx:

```yaml
```

### Path context

```yaml
```

## Examples

* [Multi-platform image](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/)
* [Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/secrets/)
* [Push to multi-registries](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/push-multi-registries/)
* [Manage tags and labels](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/manage-tags-labels/)
* [Cache management](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/cache/)
* [Export to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/export-docker/)
* [Test before push](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/test-before-push/)

152,"# \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Discord for GitHub Actions

[![Build Status][build-badge]][build-url]

Sends a Discord notification message. Simple as that.
Supports all [workflow event types](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) by using the [Discord GitHub webhooks](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-githubcompatible-webhook).

*Appearance on Discord :*

![Discord message](preview.png ""Discord message"")

This GitHub action is part of a list of Actions that are located in an other repo. Feel free to check it out : https://github.com/Ilshidur/actions.

## Compatibility note

As this Action is containerized with Docker, [it can only run on Linux environments](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#types-of-actions).

> Docker container actions can only execute in the GitHub-hosted Linux environment.
> Self-hosted runners must use a Linux operating system and have Docker installed to run Docker container actions. For more information about the requirements of self-hosted runners, see ""About self-hosted runners.""

<hr/>

## Usage

```yaml
```

**NOTICE :** for stability purposes, it is recommended to use the action with an explicit commit SHA-1 :

* Version : `uses: ""Ilshidur/action-discord@0.3.2""` (&rarr; link to the releases list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord/releases)
* Commit SHA-1 : `uses: ""Ilshidur/action-discord@0c4b27844ba47cb1c7bee539c8eead5284ce9fa9""` (&rarr; link to the commits list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord/commits/master)

### Arguments

By default, the GitHub action will send a notificaction with the event informations. Providing the arguments will override the message.

**Environment variables** can be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) :

e.g.: `Action called : {{ GITHUB_ACTION }}`

**Event Payload** data can also be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) with the `EVENT_PAYLOAD` variable.

e.g.: `Action called: {{ GITHUB_ACTION }} as {{ EVENT_PAYLOAD.pull_request.id }}`

> See the [event types](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types) for valid payload informations.

#### Examples

* `args = ""Hello, beautiful ! I ran a GitHub Actions for you <3""`
* `args = ""I showed you my commit. Please respond.""`

### Environment variables

* **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** (**required**): the Discord webhook URL (see https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
  * ***IMPORTANT !!* You MUST NOT append `/github` at the end of the webhook.**
* **`DISCORD_USERNAME`** (*optional*): overrides the bot nickname.
* **`DISCORD_AVATAR`** (*optional*): overrides the avatar URL.
* **`DISCORD_EMBEDS`** (*optional*): This should be a valid JSON string of an array of Discord `embed` objects. See the [documentation on Discord WebHook Embeds](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/structure/embeds.html) for more information. You can use set it to `${{ toJson(my_value) }}` using [`toJson()`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#tojson) if your input is an object value.
* That\'s all.

153,"# GitHub Action to Sync S3 Bucket \xf0\x9f\x94\x84

This simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote S3 bucket.


## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

As of v0.3.0, all [`aws s3 sync` flags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) are optional to allow for maximum customizability (that's a word, I promise) and must be provided by you via `args:`.

#### The following example includes optimal defaults for a public static website:

- `--acl public-read` makes your files publicly readable (make sure your [bucket settings are also set to public](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html)).
- `--follow-symlinks` won't hurt and fixes some weird symbolic link problems that may come up.
- Most importantly, `--delete` **permanently deletes** files in the S3 bucket that are **not** present in the latest version of your repository/build.
- **Optional tip:** If you're uploading the root of your repository, adding `--exclude '.git/*'` prevents your `.git` folder from syncing, which would expose your source code history if your project is closed-source. (To exclude more than one pattern, you must have one `--exclude` flag per exclusion. The single quotes are also important!)

```yaml
```


### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.

| Key | Value | Suggested Type | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS Access Key. [More info here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) | `secret env` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS Secret Access Key. [More info here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) | `secret env` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET` | The name of the bucket you're syncing to. For example, `jarv.is` or `my-app-releases`. | `secret env` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AWS_REGION` | The region where you created your bucket. Set to `us-east-1` by default. [Full list of regions here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) | `env` | No | `us-east-1` |
| `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint URL of the bucket you're syncing to. Can be used for [VPC scenarios](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-endpoint-for-amazon-s3/) or for non-AWS services using the S3 API, like [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/adapting-an-existing-aws-s3-application-to-digitalocean-spaces). | `env` | No | Automatic (`s3.amazonaws.com` or AWS's region-specific equivalent) |
| `SOURCE_DIR` | The local directory (or file) you wish to sync/upload to S3. For example, `public`. Defaults to your entire repository. | `env` | No | `./` (root of cloned repository) |
| `DEST_DIR` | The directory inside of the S3 bucket you wish to sync/upload to. For example, `my_project/assets`. Defaults to the root of the bucket. | `env` | No | `/` (root of bucket) |

154,"# Invalidate AWS CloudFront action

A GitHub Workflow Action for invalidating CloudFront distribution paths

## Usage

```yaml
```

See also a [sample workflow](./example.yml) which illustrates a static site
build and deploy.

## Configuration

| Param                 | Required? | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

__Note__: *either* `PATHS` or `PATHS_FROM` is required. `PATHS_FROM` will
overwrite `PATHS` if both are set.

See also: [AWS CLI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudfront/create-invalidation.html)

### Paths

Paths are passed directly to the aws cli `create-invalidation` command and so
must be a proper space-separated list of paths. Examples:

```sh
```

Alternatively, you can write the list of files to invalidate to a file which
will then be slurped into the PATHS variable. This lets you use some other
method to dynamically generate the list of files based on the commit, etc.
Example workflow steps:

```yaml
```

### AWS Credentials

The recommended way to pass AWS credentials to your GitHub actions is to use
[OpenID
Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services).

Once configured, you can use the
[aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
action to properly authentication and supply AWS credentials to subsequent steps
in your workflow.

Note that your workflow will need the following permission when using OIDC:

```yaml
```

For a complete example, see the [workflow](./.github/workflows/tests.yml) in
this repository.

Also note that if you using the CloudFormation template from the aws repo above,
the \'thumbprint\' shown in the example is out of date. I\'ve included a [working
template](./docs/github-oidc.yaml) complete with the below IAM policy that
should work out of the box (as of 2022-01-27).

As an alternative, you may directly pass an access/secret key pair. See the
config section above.

### AWS IAM Policy

In order to use this action, you will need to supply credentials which have, at minimum, the following permission:

```json
```

## Self-hosted runners

A note regarding [self-hosted
runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners):

`V2` of the `invalidate-cloudfront-action` executes via a bash script on the
runner and requires the following additional tools:

- jq 1.6
- aws 1.x+
- tr
- date
- wget

Please ensure that they are available on your system or use V1 of the action,
which executes within a docker container.

The sane way of creating new and updating existing Github Releases with assets.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)


### Minimal

```yaml
```

`token` is the only **always required** parameter to be passed to this action.  Everything else can use sane defaults in some circumstances.  See [arguments] to learn more.

[arguments]: #Arguments


### Arguments

All inputs are available as a _normal_ Action input (set as keys of `with:` map):


| name             | required   | description
|:----------------:|:----------:|----------------
| `token`          | **always** | Github Access token. Can be accessed using `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` in the workflow file.
| `tag`            | sometimes  | If triggered by git tag push, tag is picked up automatically.  Otherwise `tag:` has to be set.
| `commitish`      | no         | Commit hash this release should point to.  Unnecessary, if `tag` is a git tag.  Otherwise, current `master` is used. [more]
| `name`           | no         | Name the release, the more creative, the better. Defaults to the name of the tag used. [more]
| `body`           | no         | Longer description of the release, ex changelog, or info about contributors.  Defaults to the commit message of the reference commit. [more]
| `draft`          | no         | Set to `true` to create a release, but not publish it. `false` by default. [more]
| `prerelease`     | no         | Mark this release as a pre-release. `false` by default. [more]
| `files`          | no         | A **space-separated** list of files to be uploaded. When left empty, no files are uploaded. [More on files below]
| `gzip`           | no         | Set whether to `gzip` uploaded assets, or not.  Available options are: `true`, `false`, and `folders` which uploads files unchanged, but compresses directories/folders.  Defaults to `true`.  Note: it errors if set to `false`, and `files:` argument contains path to a directory.
| `allow_override` | no         | Allow override of release, if one with the same tag already exists.  Defaults to `false`

[More on files below]: #Files-syntax


#### Using ENV vars

In a step before this action, run ex:

```yml
```

To learn more about notation used above see [this].

[this]: https://help.github.com/en/articles/development-tools-for-github-actions#set-an-environment-variable-set-env


#### Files syntax

In its simplest form it takes a single file/folder to be compressed & uploaded:

```yaml
```

Each uploaded element can also be named by prefixing the path to it with: `<name>:`, example:

```yaml
```

As of Aug 2019, Github Actions doesn\'t support YAML-list arguments to actions, so multiple files need to be passed as a space-separated string.  [YAML multiline syntax] can be used to increase readability by having each file on a separate line, example:

```yaml
```
[YAML multiline syntax]: https://yaml-multiline.info/ 


### Advanced example

```yaml
    tag: ${{ env.MY_CUSTOM_TAG }}
    name: My Creative Name
    body: >
      This release actually changes the fabric of the reality, so be careful 
      while applying, as error in database migration, can irrecoverably wipe 
      some laws of physics.  
    gzip: folders
    files: >
      Dockerfile
      action.yml
     .github/
      license:LICENSE
      work-flows:.github/
```


### Versioning

As of Aug 2019, Github Actions doesn\'t natively understand shortened tags in `uses:` directive.

To go around that and not do what `git-tag-manual` calls _""[The insane thing]""_, a permanent git tag, following `v`-prefixed, semver format is created, **as well as** git branches following latest minor versions.  See the process [here].

Ex. `1.4` branch always points to the newest `v1.4.x` tag, etc.

In practice:

```yaml
```

Or

```yaml
```

Note: It\'s likely branches will be deprecated once Github Actions fixes its limitation.

## Examples

Imagine Alice sponsors Bob through GitHub Sponsors, and Bob owns a public repo, which includes this `sponsor-label` action. Then, when Alice opens an issue or PR on that repo, a bot will automatically add a `sponsor \xf0\x9f\x92\x96` label.

![Screenshot of an issue created by a sponsor, with the sponsor label added](screenshot.png)

You can see the above example here: https://github.com/devonzuegel/highly-exporter/issues/4

## Usage

You can create a `.github/workflows/label-sponsors.yml` file:

```yaml
```

This will trigger the action when an issue or pull request is opened. You\'ll need to include the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable!

By default, the label `sponsor` will be applied. If you have a different label you want to use, you can set that:

```yaml
```

## How it works

This action is designed to be triggered by the `issues` or `pull_request` events, specifically the `opened` action. When an issue or PR is opened, the action will make the following query:

```graphql
```

It will then check to see if the creator of the issue/PR is one of the sponsors in the list. If not, it\'ll try the next page of sponsors until it runs out.

> Note! This query checks to see if the opener is a sponsor of the repository\'s owning user. This does not cover all cases of sponsorship!

If the opener is a sponsor, the action will then add the `sponsor` label to the issue or pull request.

159,"# `ssh-agent` GitHub Action

This action 
* starts the `ssh-agent`, 
* exports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable, 
* loads one or several private SSH key into the agent and
* configures `known_hosts` for GitHub.com.

It should work in all GitHub Actions virtual environments, including container-based workflows. 

Windows and Docker support is, however, somewhat new. Since we have little feedback from the field, things might not run so smooth for you as we\'d hope. If Windows and/or Docker-based workflows work well for you, leave a :+1: at https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent/pull/17.

Also, using multiple GitHub deployment keys is supported; keys are mapped to repositories by using SSH key comments (see below).

## Why?

When running a GitHub Action workflow to stage your project, run tests or build images, you might need to fetch additional libraries or _vendors_ from private repositories.

GitHub Actions only have access to the repository they run for. So, in order to access additional private repositories, create an SSH key with sufficient access privileges. Then, use this action to make the key available with `ssh-agent` on the Action worker node. Once this has been set up, `git clone` commands using `ssh` URLs will _just work_. Also, running `ssh` commands to connect to other servers will be able to use the key.

## Usage

1. Generate a new SSH key with sufficient access privileges. For security reasons, don\'t use your personal SSH key but set up a dedicated one for use in GitHub Actions. See below for a few hints if you are unsure about this step.
2. Make sure you don\'t have a passphrase set on the private key.
3. Add the public SSH key to the private repository you are pulling from during the Github Action as a \'Deploy Key\'.
4. Add the private SSH key to the repository triggering the Github Action: 
    * In your repository, go to the *Settings > Secrets* menu and create a new secret. In this example, we\'ll call it `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`. 
    * Put the contents of the *private* SSH key file into the contents field. <br>
    * This key should start with `-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`, consist of many lines and ends with `-----END ... PRIVATE KEY-----`. 
5. In your workflow definition file, add the following step. Preferably this would be rather on top, near the `actions/checkout@v2` line.

```yaml
```
5. If, for some reason, you need to change the location of the SSH agent socket, you can use the `ssh-auth-sock` input to provide a path.

### Using Multiple Keys

There are cases where you might need to use multiple keys. For example, ""[deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)"" might be limited to a single repository, so you\'ll need several of them.

You can set up different keys as different secrets and pass them all to the action like so:

```yaml
```

The `ssh-agent` will load all of the keys and try each one in order when establishing SSH connections.

There\'s one **caveat**, though: SSH servers may abort the connection attempt after a number of mismatching keys have been presented. So if, for example, you have six different keys loaded into the `ssh-agent`, but the server aborts after five unknown keys, the last key (which might be the right one) will never even be tried. But when you\'re using GitHub Deploy Keys, read on!

### Support for GitHub Deploy Keys

When using **Github deploy keys**, GitHub servers will accept the _first_ known key. But since deploy keys are scoped to a single repository, this might not be the key needed to access a particular repository. Thus, you will get the error message `fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.` if the wrong key/repository combination is tried.

To support picking the right key in this use case, this action scans _key comments_ and will set up extra Git and SSH configuration to make things work.

1. When creating the deploy key for a repository like `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` or `https://github.com/owner/repo`, put that URL into the key comment. (Hint: Try `ssh-keygen ... -C ""git@github.com:owner/repo.git""`.)
2. After keys have been added to the agent, this action will scan the key comments. 
3. For key comments containing such URLs, a Git config setting is written that uses [`url.<base>.insteadof`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-urlltbasegtinsteadOf). It will redirect `git` requests to URLs starting with either `https://github.com/owner/repo` or `git@github.com:owner/repo` to a fake hostname/URL like `git@...some.hash...:owner/repo`.
4. An SSH configuration section is generated that applies to the fake hostname. It will map the SSH connection back to `github.com`, while at the same time pointing SSH to a file containing the appropriate key\'s public part. That will make SSH use the right key when connecting to GitHub.com.

## Action Inputs

The following inputs can be used to control the action\'s behavior:

* `ssh-private-key`: Required. Use this to provide the key(s) to load as GitHub Actions secrets.
* `ssh-auth-sock`: Can be used to control where the SSH agent socket will be placed. Ultimately affects the `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable.
* `log-public-key`: Set this to `false` if you want to suppress logging of _public_ key information. To simplify debugging and since it contains public key information only, this is turned on by default.
* `ssh-agent-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `ssh-agent` binary.
* `ssh-add-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `ssh-add` binary.
* `git-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `git` binary.

## Exported variables

The action exports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variables through the Github Actions core module.
The `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is used by several applications like git or rsync to connect to the SSH authentication agent.
The `$SSH_AGENT_PID` contains the process id of the agent. This is used to kill the agent in post job action.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Works for the Current Job Only

Since each job [runs in a fresh instance](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions#job) of the virtual environment, the SSH key will only be available in the job where this action has been referenced. You can, of course, add the action in multiple jobs or even workflows. All instances can use the same `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.

### SSH Private Key Format

If the private key is not in the `PEM` format, you will see an `Error loading key ""(stdin)"": invalid format` message.

Use `ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem` to convert your key file to `PEM`, but be sure to make a backup of the file first \xf0\x9f\x98\x89.

## Additional Information for Particular Tools or Platforms

If you know that your favorite tool or platform of choice requires extra tweaks or has some caveats when running with SSH, feel free to open a PR to amend this section here.

### Container-based Workflows

If you are using this action on container-based workflows, make sure the container has the necessary SSH binaries or package(s) installed.

### Building Docker Images and/or Using the `docker/build-push-action` Action

When you are building Docker images with `docker build` or `docker compose build` and need to provide the SSH keys to the build, don\'t forget to pass `--ssh default=${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}` on the command line to pass the SSH agent socket through. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#ssh) for more information on this option.

If you are using the `docker/build-push-action`, you can do so by adding the following config.

```yml
```

Make sure not to miss the next section, though.

### Using Multiple Deploy Keys Inside Docker Builds

When you pass the SSH agent socket to the Docker build environment _and_ want to use multiple GitHub deploy keys, you need to copy the Git and SSH configuration files to the build environment as well. This is necessary _in addition to_ forwarding the SSH agent socket into the build process. The config files are required so that Git can pick the right one from your deployment keys.

This requires an additional step in the workflow file **after** the `ssh-agent` step and **before** the Docker build step.  You also need two additional lines in the `Dockerfile` to actually copy the configs.

The following example will: 
* collect the necessary Git and SSH configuration files in a directory that must be part of the Docker build context so that... 
* ... the files can be copied into the Docker image (or an intermediate build stage).

Workflow:

```yml
```

Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
```

Keep in mind that the resulting Docker image now might contain these customized Git and SSH configuration files! Your private SSH keys are never written to files anywhere, just loaded into the SSH agent and forwarded into the container. The config files might, however, give away details about your build or development process and contain the names and URLs of your (private) repositories. You might want to use a multi-staged build to make sure these files do not end up in the final image.

If you still get the error message: `fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.`, you most likely forgot one of the steps above.

### Cargo\'s (Rust) Private Dependencies on Windows

If you are using private repositories in your dependencies like this:

```
```

... you will need to change a configuration in the workflow for Windows machines in order to make cargo able to clone private repositories.

There are 2 ways you can achieve this:

1. Add this step once in your job **before** any cargo command:

```
```

This will configure Cargo to use the Git CLI as explained in the [Cargo\'s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#netgit-fetch-with-cli).

2. Alternatively you can set it to the environment variables for the entire workflow:

```
```

### Using Deploy Keys with Swift Package Manager

`xcodebuild` by default uses Xcode\'s built-in Git tooling. If you want to use GitHub Deploy Keys as supported by this action, however, that version of Git will lack the necessary URL remapping. In this case, pass `-scmProvider system` to the `xcodebuild` command, as mentioned in [Apple\'s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/building_swift_packages_or_apps_that_use_them_in_continuous_integration_workflows#3680255).

## What this Action *cannot* do for you

The following items are not issues, but beyond what this Action is supposed to do.

### Work on Remote Machines

When using `ssh` to connect from the GitHub Action worker node to another machine, you *can* forward the SSH Agent socket and use your private key on the other (remote) machine. However, this Action will not configure `known_hosts` or other SSH settings on the remote machine for you.

### Provide the SSH Key as a File

This Action is designed to pass the SSH key directly into `ssh-agent`; that is, the key is available in memory on the GitHub Action worker node, but never written to disk. As a consequence, you _cannot_ pass the key as a build argument or a mounted file into Docker containers that you build or run on the worker node. You _can_, however, mount the `ssh-agent` Unix socket into a Docker container that you _run_, set up the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env var and then use SSH from within the container (see https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent/issues/11).

### Run `ssh-keyscan` to Add Host Keys for Additional Hosts

If you want to use `ssh-keyscan` to add additional hosts (that you own/know) to the `known_hosts` file, you can do so with a single shell line in your Action definition. You don\'t really need this Action to do this for you.

As a side note, using `ssh-keyscan` without proper key verification is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. You might prefer putting your _known_ SSH host key in your own Action files to add it to the `known_hosts` file. The SSH host key is not secret and can safely be committed into the repo. 

## Creating SSH Keys

In order to create a new SSH key, run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f path/to/keyfile`, as suggested in [this blog post](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html). 
If you need to work with some older server software and need RSA keys, try `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -f path/to/keyfile` instead.

Both commands will prompt you for a key passphrase and save the key in `path/to/keyfile`.
In general, having a passphrase is a good thing, since it will keep the key encrypted on your disk. When using the key with this action, however, you need to make sure you don\'t 
specify a passphrase: The key must be usable without reading the passphrase from input. Since the key itself is stored using GitHub\'s ""Secret"" feature, it should be fairly safe anyway.

## Authorizing a Key

To actually grant the SSH key access, you can \xe2\x80\x93 on GitHub \xe2\x80\x93 use at least two ways:

* [Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be added to individual GitHub repositories. They can give read and/or write access to the particular repository. When pulling a lot of dependencies, however, you\'ll end up adding the key in many places. Rotating the key probably becomes difficult. The deploy key needs to be added to the private repository that is being fetched as a private dependency.

* A [machine user](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) can be used for more fine-grained permissions management and have access to multiple repositories with just one instance of the key being registered. It will, however, count against your number of users on paid GitHub plans.

## Hacking

As a note to my future self, in order to work on this repo:

* Clone it
* Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies
* _hack hack hack_
* `node index.js`. Inputs are passed through `INPUT_` env vars with their names uppercased.

  On *nix use:
  ```bash
    ```

  On Windows (cmd):
  ```cmd
  set /P INPUT_SSH-PRIVATE-KEY=< file
  node index.js
  ```

  On Windows (PowerShell):
  ```ps
  ${env:INPUT_SSH-PRIVATE-KEY} = (Get-Content .\\test-keys -Raw); node index.js
  node index.js
  ```
* Run `npm run build` to update `dist/*`, which holds the files actually run
* Read https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-javascript-action if unsure.
* Maybe update the README example when publishing a new version.

160,"# NOTICE: This action is no longer being maintained

Due the maintainer passing away, this action is no longer being maintained as of Janyary 2023.

Development has moved to [onyxmueller/build-tag-number](https://github.com/onyxmueller/build-tag-number) and the action is available on the Marketplace here: <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-tag-number>

Updating your existing Github Actions workflows should be as simple as replacing `einaregilsson/build-number@v3` with `onyxmueller/build-tag-number@v1`

See the repo linked above for more information.

## Update 2020-02-12

GitHub has just introduced new environment variables, `GITHUB_RUN_ID` and `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` which are unique numbers for each workflow run, so you\'re probably better off using those than this GitHub action. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 See https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables

# build-number
GitHub action for generating sequential build numbers for GitHub actions. The build number is stored in your GitHub repository as a ref, it doesn\'t add any extra commits to your repository. Use in your workflow like so:

```yaml
```

After that runs the subsequent steps in your job will have the environment variable `BUILD_NUMBER` available. If you prefer to be more explicit you can use the output of the step, like so:

```yaml
```
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is defined by GitHub already for you. See [virtual environments for GitHub actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret) for more information.

## Getting the build number in other jobs

For other steps in the same job you can use the methods above,
to actually get the build number in other jobs you need to use [job outputs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjobs_idoutputs) mechanism:

```yaml
```

## Setting the initial build number.

If you\'re moving from another build system, you might want to start from some specific number. The `build-number` action simply uses a special tag name to store the build number, `build-number-x`, so you can just create and push a tag with the number you want to start on. E.g. do

```
```

and then your next build number will be 501. The action will always delete older refs that start with `build-number-`, e.g. when it runs and finds `build-number-500` it will create a new tag, `build-number-501` and then delete `build-number-500`.

## Generating multiple independent build numbers

Sometimes you may have more than one project to build in one repository. For example you may have a client and a server in the same github repository that you would like to generate independent build numbers for. Another example is you have two Dockerfiles in one repo and you\'d like to version each of the built images with their own numbers.  
To do this, use the `prefix` key, like so:

```yaml
```

This will generate a git tag like `client-build-number-1`.

If you then do the same in another workflow and use `prefix: server` then you\'ll get a second build-number tag called `server-build-number-1`.

## Branches and build numbers

The build number generator is global, there\'s no concept of special build numbers for special branches unless handled manually with the `prefix` property. It\'s probably something you would just use on builds from your master branch. It\'s just one number that gets increased every time the action is run.

So, that\'s it. Hope you can use it. You can read more about how it works in this blog post: http://einaregilsson.com/a-github-action-for-generating-sequential-build-numbers/

## Usage

Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in your project, e.g. at `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. The content of the file should be in the following format:

```yml
```

## Examples

All linters are disabled by default. To enable a linter, simply set the option with its name to `true`, e.g. `eslint: true`.

The action doesn\'t install the linters for you; you are responsible for installing them in your CI environment.

### JavaScript example (ESLint and Prettier)

```yml
```

**Important:** Make sure to exclude the `.github` directory in your ESLint and Prettier configs as the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` **cannot** be used to update workflow files due to the missing `workflow` permission. See [Limitations](#limitations).

### PHP example (PHP_CodeSniffer)

```yml
```

If you prefer to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) you can also use this:

```yml
```

### Python example (Flake8 and Black)

```yml
```

### C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ example (clang_format)

```yml
```

### C# and VB.NET example (dotnet_format)

```yml
```

### AutoFix example

```yml
```

With `auto_fix` set to `true`, by default the action will try and fix code issues automatically and commit and push them automatically. Here however, `flake8` linter does not support auto-fixing, so setting `flake8_auto_fix` to `false` will prevent any unnecessary warnings.

## Configuration

### Linter-specific options

`[linter]` can be one of `autopep8`, `black`, `clang_format`, `dotnet_format`, `erblint`, `eslint`, `flake8`, `gofmt`, `golint`, `mypy`, `oitnb`, `php_codesniffer`, `prettier`, `pylint`, `rubocop`, `stylelint`, `swift_format_official`, `swift_format_lockwood`, `swiftlint` and `xo`:

- **`[linter]`:** Enables the linter in your repository. Default: `false`
- **`[linter]_args`**: Additional arguments to pass to the linter. Example: `eslint_args: ""--max-warnings 0""` if ESLint checks should fail even if there are no errors and only warnings. Default: `""""`
- **`[linter]_dir`**: Directory where the linting command should be run. Example: `eslint_dir: server/` if ESLint is installed in the `server` subdirectory. Default: Repository root
- **`[linter]_extensions`:** Extensions of files to check with the linter. Example: `eslint_extensions: js,ts` to lint JavaScript and TypeScript files with ESLint. Default: Varies by linter, see [`action.yml`](./action.yml)
- **`[linter]_command_prefix`:** Command prefix to be run before the linter command. Default: `""""`.
- **`[linter]_auto_fix`:** Whether the linter should try to fix code style issues automatically. This option is useful to commit and push changes only for specific linters and not all of them when `auto_fix` option is set. Default: `true` if linter supports auto-fixing, `false` if not.

### General options

- **`github_token`:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` to [authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow). Defaults to the GitHub token.

- **`continue_on_error`:** Whether the workflow run should also fail when linter failures are detected. Default: `true`

- **`auto_fix`:** Whether linters should try to fix code style issues automatically. If some issues can be fixed, the action will apply the needed changes. Default: `false`

  <p align=""center"">
    <img src=""./.github/screenshots/auto-fix.png"" alt=""Screenshot of auto-fix commit"" width=""80%"" />
  </p>

- **`commit`:** Whether to commit and push the changes made by `auto_fix`. Default: `true`

- **`git_name`**: Username for auto-fix commits. Default: `""Lint Action""`

- **`git_email`**: Email address for auto-fix commits. Default: `""lint-action@samuelmeuli.com""`

- **`git_no_verify`**: Bypass the pre-commit and pre-push git hooks. Default: `false`

- **`commit_message`**: Template for auto-fix commit messages. The `${linter}` variable can be used to insert the name of the linter. Default: `""Fix code style issues with ${linter}""`

- **`check_name`**: Template for the [name of the check run](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#create-a-check-run). Use this to ensure unique names when the action is used more than once in a workflow. The `${linter}` and `${dir}` variables can be used to insert the name and directory of the linter. Default: `""${linter}""`

- **`neutral_check_on_warning`:** Whether the check run should conclude with a neutral status instead of success when the linter finds only warnings. Default: `false`

### Linter support

## Limitations

### Pull requests

There are currently some limitations as to how this action (or any other action) can be used in the context of `pull_request` events from forks:

- The action doesn\'t have permission to push auto-fix changes to the fork. This is because the `pull_request` event runs on the upstream repo, where the `github_token` is lacking permissions for the fork. [Source](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Can-t-push-to-forked-repository-on-the-original-repository-s/m-p/35916/highlight/true#M2372)
- The action doesn\'t have permission to create annotations for commits on forks unless you use the `pull_request_target` event. You can modify the default permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` by using the `permissions` key and set the `checks` scope to `write`. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) for more.

### Auto-fixing workflow files

If `auto_fix` is enabled and the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used, none of the linters should be allowed to change files in `.github/workflows` as the token doesn\'t have the necessary `workflow` permission. This can be achieved by adding the directory to the ignore config of the used linter. [Source](https://github.community/t/github-linting-remote-rejected/121365)

This repository contains a checklist of common issues to be used when conducting code reviews as well as a Github Action which automatically posts the checklist when a new pull request is created.

# The Checklist

The checklist can be found in [checklist.md](./checklist.md). If you would like to suggest changes, please submit a pull request to this repository.

# GitHub Action

To set up the github action in a new repository, create a folder named `.github` in the repository root, and inside create a file named `main.workflow`. (If the repository already has actions set up then skip this step, the file will already exist.)

Add the following to the workflow file.

```
```

This creates a new workflow named `PR Checklist` which will be triggered every time a pull request is created (`on = ""pull_request""`). When triggered, it will run an action named `Create PR Comment`. Define that action by adding the following:

```
```

This creates an action named `Create PR Comment`, and the `uses` statement instructs github actions to find and run the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) in this repository. If you would like to pin the action to a specific commit, you can replace `@master` with a commit hash or tag. The line `secrets = [""GITHUB_TOKEN""]` supplies a token into the dockerfile which will allow the scripts inside the container to access the GitHub API.

Finally save the workflow, and whenever a Pull Request is created in the repository a comment will be automatically posted containing the contents of [checklist.md](./checklist.md).

NOTE: The workflow will only execute for pull requests on branches which contain `.github/main.workflow`, so any existing branches will need to be updated if you have made these changes on master.

165,"# GitHub Action: Push git subdirectory as branch

[![](https://github.com/s0/git-publish-subdir-action/workflows/Scheduled%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/s0/git-publish-subdir-action/actions?workflow=Scheduled+tests) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/s0/git-publish-subdir-action/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/s0/git-publish-subdir-action) [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0/git-publish-subdir-action/gh-badges/drift.svg)](https://github.com/s0/libyear-node-action) [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0/git-publish-subdir-action/gh-badges/releases.svg)](https://github.com/s0/libyear-node-action)

This GitHub Action will take any subdirectory in your repository, and push it as the contents of a git branch to a repository and branch of your choosing, either over SSH or to the current repo.

You could use this for example to:

* Publishing a subdirectory to a repo\'s `gh-pages` branch, after optionally running a build step.
* Publishing build artifacts / binaries to another repository

The target repository can be anywhere accessible by a [Git SSH URL](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols#_the_ssh_protocol) (or the current repository).
If the target branch doesn\'t exist yet, it will be created automatically.

## Usage

Simply include the action `s0/git-publish-subdir-action@develop` in the appropriate point in your workflow, and pass in the required configuration options:

```yml
```

## Examples

### When pushed to master, push `/public/site` to the `gh-pages` branch on the same repo

```yml
```


### When pushed to master, push the contents of `/public/site` to the `www` folder on the  `gh-pages` branch on the same repo

```yml
        TARGET_DIR: www
```

### When pushed to master, run a build step, then push `/build` to the `gh-pages` branch on another repo on GitHub

```yml
```

Note: the SSH Key needs to have write access to the given repo. It\'s recommended you use [Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) for this (see below),
and store the SSH private key as as Secret in the repository settings.


### When pushed to master, run a build step, then push `/dist` to the `artifacts` branch on a repo hosted at mydomain.com

```yml
```

You can generate a `known_hosts`  file for a given domain by using `ssh-keyscan`, e.g:

```bash
```


## Configuration

All configuration options are passed in via `env`, as environment variables.

| Env Variable       | Description                                            | Required?     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `REPO`             | Either `self`, or an SSH url to the target repository. | Yes           |
| `BRANCH`           | The target branch to publish to.                       | Yes           |
| `FOLDER`           | The target subfolder you would like to publish         | Yes           |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`  | The private key that should be used to authenticate on SSH. Don\'t include this directly in the workflow file, instead you must use [Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) | When `REPO` is an SSH URL |
| `KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE` | Path to a file in the repository that contains the known SSH fingerprints for the target host. | When the target host is not github.com |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`     | Should always be equal to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` | When `REPO = self` |
| `SQUASH_HISTORY`   | If set to `true`, all previous commits on the target branch will be discarded. For example, if you are deploying a static site with lots of binary artifacts, this can help the repository becoming overly bloated. | No |
| `SKIP_EMPTY_COMMITS` | If set to `true`, commits will only be pushed if the contents of the target branch will be changed as a result. This is useful if, for example, you\'d like to easily track which upstream changes result in changes to your target branch. | No |
| `MESSAGE`          | A custom template to use as the commit message pushed to the target branch. See [custom commit messages](#custom-commit-messages). | No |
| `TAG` | A string following the [git-check-ref-format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format) that tags the commit with a lightweight git-tag. |\xc2\xa0No |
| `CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE` | An optional path to a file to use as a list of globs defining which files to delete when clearing the target branch. |\xc2\xa0No |
| `COMMIT_NAME` | The username the autogenerated commit will use. If unset, uses the commit pusher\'s username. | No |
| `COMMIT_EMAIL` | The email the autogenerated commit will use. If unset, uses the commit pusher\'s email. | No |
| `TARGET_DIR` | An optional string to change the directory where the files are copied to. |\xc2\xa0No |


### Custom commit messages

You can specify a custom string to use in the commit message
when pushing to your target repository.
These strings support a number of placeholders that will be replaces with
relevant values:

| Placeholder        | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `{target-branch}`  | The name of the target branch being updated           |
| `{sha}`            | The 7-character sha of the HEAD of the current branch |
| `{long-sha}`       | The full sha of the HEAD of the current branch        |
| `{msg}`            | The commit message for the HEAD of the current branch |

Example Usage:

```yml
```

### Custom clear operations

By default, this action will clear the target branch of any pre-existing files,
and only keep those that are defined in the target `FOLDER` when the action was
run.

This can now be overwritten by specifying a file with a custom list of globs to
define which files should be deleted from the target branch before copying the
new files over.

The environment variable `CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE` should point to the path of the
glob file (which can have any name) relative to root of the target repository.

**Note: using this feature will disable the default functionality of deleting
everything, and you will need to specify exactly what needs to be deleted.**

#### Examples

1. Default behaviour:

   ```
   **/*
   !.git
   ```

1. Default behaviour with a custom target directory:

   ```
   target_dir/**/*
   !.git
   ```

1. Delete everything except the `.git` and `foobar` folder:

   ```
   **/*
   !.git
   !foobar/**/*
   ```

1. Only delete the folder `folder` (except `folder/a`), and also delete anything
   matching `ini*al2`:

   ```
   folder/*
   !folder/a
   ini*al2
   ```

For clarity, if we have the file `.clear-target-files`:

```
```

And the workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yml
```

And the target branch already had the files:

```
```

Then the files that would remain would be:

```
```

An empty file can be used to indicate that the branch should not be cleared at
all.



## Usage with [Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys)

When pushing to other repositories on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise,
the recommended mechanism is to use [Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) rather than your own private SSH key.
Deploy keys are SSH keys that can be added to specific repositories to be given write access to only
those repositories.
This is preferable to adding your own personal ssh private key to a repository\'s secrets store,
as it means that any actions that have access to this repository\'s secrets can only push
to repositories that have explicitly had the SSH key added as a deploy key,
and not *all* repositories that your user account have access to.

Use `ssh-keygen` to create a new ssh key, add these to GitHub in the relevant repo\'s deploy keys and Secrets, then delete them off your computer.

## Setting up a SSH Key

Make sure to follow the below steps while creating SSH Keys and using them.
The best practice is create the SSH Keys on local machine not remote machine.
Login with username specified in Github Secrets. Generate a RSA Key-Pair:

```bash
```

Add newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).

```bash
```

Copy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.

```bash
```

See the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).

**A note** from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:

* Put the public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys2`
* Change the permissions of `.ssh` to 700
* Change the permissions of `.ssh/authorized_keys2` to 640

### If you are using OpenSSH

If you are currently using OpenSSH and are getting the following error:

```bash
```

Make sure that your key algorithm of choice is supported.
On Ubuntu 20.04 or later you must explicitly allow the use of the ssh-rsa algorithm. Add the following line to your OpenSSH daemon file (which is either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or a drop-in file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):

```bash
```

Alternatively, `ed25519` keys are accepted by default in OpenSSH. You could use this instead of rsa if needed:

```bash
```

## Example

Copy file via a SSH password:

```yaml
```

Copy file via a SSH key:

```yaml
```

Example configuration for ignore list:

```yaml
```

Example configuration for multiple servers:

```diff
```

Example configuration for exclude custom files:

```yaml
```

Upload artifact files to remote server:

```yaml
```

Remove the specified number of leading path elements:

```yaml
```

Old target structure:

```sh
```

New target structure:

```sh
```

Only copy files that are newer than the corresponding destination files:

```yaml
```

Protecting a Private Key. The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key. This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker. It is not uncommon for files to leak from backups or decommissioned hardware, and hackers commonly exfiltrate files from compromised systems.

```diff
```

When copying files from a Linux runner to a Windows server, you should:

1. Download git for Windows
2. Change the default OpenSSH shell to git bach with the following powershell command.
3. Set `tar_dereference` and `rm` variable to `true` in the YAML file
4. Avoid putting the `port` value through a variable
5. Convert the target path to a Unix path: `/c/path/to/target/`

Change the default OpenSSH shell to git bach with the following powershell command.

```powershell
```

Convert the target path to a Unix path: `/c/path/to/target/`

```diff
```

### :warning: This action is deprecated. Please consider using [lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action).

A GitHub action for link checking repository Markdown and HTML files.

When used in conjunction with [Create Issue From File](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file), issues will be created when Link Checker finds connectivity problems with links.

## Usage

Using with the default settings will check all markdown and HTML files in your repository.

```yml
```

Link Checker uses [Liche](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche).
Liche arguments can be passed to the action via the `args` parameter. If not set, the default `-v -r *` will be used.

```yml
      with:
        args: -v -r *
```

See [Liche's documentation](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche) for further argument details.

#### Optional environment variables

If Link Checker finds connectivity problems with links the action will output a markdown file containing the error report.
The default path is `link-checker/out.md`. The path and filename may be overridden with the following variables.

- `LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_DIR` - The output directory the markdown error report
- `LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_FILENAME` - The error report filename

#### Receiving issues containing the error report

Below is an example of using this action in conjunction with [Create Issue From File](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file). The workflow executes on a schedule every month. Issues will be created when Link Checker finds connectivity problems with links.

```yml
```

#### Issue sample

[This link](https://aoushaoueshosuhoshuoeu.com) is intentionally non-existent.
The workflow in this repository generated [this sample issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/link-checker/issues/1).

#### Creating a failing check for link errors

To create a failing check when there are link errors you can use the `exit_code` output from the action as follows.

```yml
```

A GitHub action to create an issue using content from a file.

This is designed to be used in conjunction with other actions that output to a file.
Especially if that output can be formatted as [GitHub flavoured Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
This action will create an issue if a file exists at a specified path.
The content of the issue will be taken from the file as-is.
If the file does not exist the action exits silently.

## Usage

```yml
```

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The target GitHub repository. | Current repository |
| `issue-number` | The issue number of an existing issue to update. | |
| `title` | (**required**) The title of the issue. | |
| `content-filepath` | The file path to the issue content. | |
| `labels` | A comma or newline-separated list of labels. | |
| `assignees` | A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames). | |

### Outputs

- `issue-number` - The number of the created issue

### Create a project card

To create a project card for the issue, pass the `issue-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.

```yml
```

# Setup-VSTest

**Many thanks Warren Buckley for his [Setup-MSBuild](https://github.com/warrenbuckley/Setup-MSBuild) action which serves as the basis for this action.**

This action sets up VSTest.console.exe as a CLI tool for use in actions by:
- optionally downloading and caching a version of VSWhere.exe to help find the latest VSTest.console.exe on the machine
- Adds the location of the VSTest.console.exe to the PATH

171,"# Setup NuGet.exe

This action downloads and installs a given version of `NuGet.exe`. Using this
action will add `nuget` to your `$PATH` on all operating systems, including
macOS and linux, without having to prefix it with `mono`.

NuGet functionality also gets delivered with Visual Studio, msbuild and dotnet SDK. You should consider using the
official [`setup-dotnet`](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) or
[one of the `msbuild` actions](https://github.com/marketplace?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=msbuild).

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Supported values for `nuget-version`:

* `latest` -- the latest blessed NuGet release.
* `preview` -- the latest EarlyAccessPreview release.
* `X.Y.Z` -- concrete semver version for a release (e.g. `5.3.1`).
* semver range -- any [valid semver range specifier](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges) (e.g. `5`, `>=5`, `5.3.x`, etc)

This action also supports configuring your NuGet API key using
[GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).
The API key should be passed in as an `nuget-api-key` input. See
[the GitHub documentation on secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets)
for how to configure secrets on your repository.

### Basic:

```yaml
```

### Matrix Testing:

```yaml
```

# Caching

The downloaded `nuget.exe` files are automatically cached between runs. To cache
your global nuget directory, consider using the [official cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#c---nuget).

### Caching Example

Note: For this example, you\'ll need to enable [repeatable builds](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/) for your project.

```yaml
```

# Contributing

## Code in Main

Install the dependencies
```bash
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:
```bash
```

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

173,"# GitHub Action to Deploy Static Assets to GitHub Pages

**This action has been deprecated.
There\'s [now ""native"" support for publishing to GitHub Pages using an official GitHub action by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages).
It is much better than this approach.**

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghpages/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghpages/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

This action simply lets you deploy arbitrary folders of static content from your workflow\'s working directory (`/github/workspace`) to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
This works by having your action instance `git push` your chosen asset folder (`BUILD_DIR`) to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository for the `gh-pages` branch to be served.
If you are running this action inside an [organization or user repository](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) (named `username/username.github.io`) it will deploy to the `master` branch instead.

Remember that you may also have to adjust your [repository settings](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

Because this action deploys to separate, ""deploy-only"" branches, you can not use it if you want to deploy from a repo subdirectory such as `docs/`.
In those cases you really don\'t need a GitHub Action, because you would be committing the build artifacts yourself.
For details see the [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

There are already great GitHub actions to use static site generators *and* then deploy to GitHub Pages (for [jekyll](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action), [jekyll](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages), [zola](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action) and surely many more to come).
This action isn\'t that, though I\'ve borrowed much of the git action from these works.

**This action will not build anything, it just deploys.**

## Inputs

None.


## Outputs

None.


## Secrets

Deployment to GitHub pages happens by `git push`ing to the `gh-pages` (or `master`) branch.
To authorise this, the GitHub action needs a secret.
For now, somewhat confusingly, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` [available for every repo](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets/) *does* suffice to push to `gh-pages`, but *does not* suffice to trigger a  page build on GitHub, or even propagate the content to the GitHub content-delivery network.

You therefore **have to [create a custom Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)** much like you\'d do for external services (say, Travis). This token must be created with `repo` permissions in order to deploy to Github Pages.
You then have to paste this token into the GitHub UI as a secret under the name `GH_PAT` (repository settings/secrets) and call it in the action as in the below.

I\'ve asked GitHub to streamline this process.
The discussion is documented [here](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghaction-ghpages/issues/1).


## Environment Variables

Just `BUILD_DIR`, the build directory relative to your repository root.
You can also pass `.` if you want to push your repository root.


## Example Usage

```yaml
```

174,"# Run-On-Arch GitHub Action

[![](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action)

A GitHub Action that executes commands on non-x86 CPU architecture (armv6, armv7, aarch64, s390x, ppc64le) via QEMU.

## Usage

This action requires three input parameters:

* `arch`: CPU architecture: `armv6`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `riscv64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`. See [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) for the full matrix.
* `distro`: Linux distribution name: `ubuntu16.04`, `ubuntu18.04`, `ubuntu20.04`, `bullseye`, `buster`, `stretch`, `jessie`, `fedora_latest`, `alpine_latest` or `archarm_latest`. See [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) for the full matrix.
* `run`: Shell commands to execute in the container.

The action also accepts some optional input parameters:

* `githubToken`: Your GitHub token, used for caching Docker images in your project\'s public package registry. Usually this would just be `${{ github.token }}`. This speeds up subsequent builds and is highly recommended.
* `env`: Environment variables to propagate to the container. YAML, but must begin with a `|` character. These variables will be available in both run and setup.
* `shell`: The shell to run commands with in the container. Default: `/bin/sh` on Alpine, `/bin/bash` for other distros.
* `dockerRunArgs`: Additional arguments to pass to `docker run`, such as volume mappings. See [`docker run` documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run).
* `setup`: Shell commands to execute on the host before running the container, such as creating directories for volume mappings.
* `install`: Shell commands to execute in the container as part of `docker build`, such as installing dependencies. This speeds up subsequent builds if `githubToken` is also used, but note that the image layer will be publicly available in your projects GitHub Package Registry, so make sure the resulting image does not have any secrets cached in logs or state.
* `base_image`: Specify a custom base image, such as [busybox](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox), `arch` and `distro` should be set to `none` in this case. This will allow you to chose direcly the image that will be used in the *FROM* clause of the internal docker container without needing to create a Dockerfile.arch.distro for a specific arch/distro pair. For more detials, see [PR #103](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/pull/103#issuecomment-1363810049). Known limitation: Only one base_image configuration for each workflow if you use GitHub images caching.

### Basic example

A basic example that sets an output variable for use in subsequent steps:

```yaml
```

### Advanced example

This shows how to use a matrix to produce platform-specific artifacts, and includes example values for the optional input parameters `setup`, `shell`, `env`, and `dockerRunArgs`.

```yaml
```

## Supported Platforms

This table details the valid `arch`/`distro` combinations:


| arch     | distro     |
| -------- | ---------- |
| armv6    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, alpine_latest |
| armv7    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest, archarm_latest |
| aarch64  | stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest, archarm_latest |
| riscv64  | ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, alpine_edge |
| s390x    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest |
| ppc64le  | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04,ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest |


Using an invalid `arch`/`distro` combination will fail.

## Architecture emulation

This project makes use of an additional QEMU container to be able to emulate via software architectures like ARM, s390x, ppc64le, etc... that are not natively supported by GitHub. You should keep this into consideration when reasoning about the expected running time of your jobs, there will be a visible impact on performance when compared to a job executed on a vanilla runner.

## Contributing

New distros and archs can be added simply by creating a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.{arch}.{distro}` (that targets an image for the desired combination) in the [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/blob/master/Dockerfiles) directory. Pull requests welcome!

This action allows you to select which files to upload to the just-tagged release.
It runs on all operating systems types offered by GitHub.

## Input variables

You must provide:

- `file`: A local file to be uploaded as the asset.

Optional Arguments

- `repo_token`: Defaults to `github.token`.
- `tag`: The tag to upload into. If you want the current event\'s tag or branch name, use `${{ github.ref }}` (the `refs/tags/` and `refs/heads/` prefixes will be automatically stripped). Defaults to `github.ref`.
- `asset_name`: The name the file gets as an asset on a release. Use `$tag` to include the tag name. When not provided it will default to the filename.
                This is not used if `file_glob` is set to `true`.
- `file_glob`: If set to true, the `file` argument can be a glob pattern (`asset_name` is ignored in this case) (Default: `false`)
- `overwrite`: If an asset with the same name already exists, overwrite it (Default: `false`).
- `promote`: If a prerelease already exists, promote it to a release (Default: `false`).
- `prerelease`: Mark the release as a pre-release (Default: `false`).
- `make_latest`: Mark the release as the latest release for the repository (Default: `true`).
- `release_name`: Explicitly set a release name. (Defaults: implicitly same as `tag` via GitHub API).
- `target_commit`: Sets the commit hash or branch for the tag to be based on (Default: the default branch, usually `main`).
- `body`: Content of the release text (Default: `""""`).
- `repo_name`: Specify the name of the GitHub repository in which the GitHub release will be created, edited, and deleted. If the repository is other than the current, it is required to create a personal access token with `repo`, `user`, `admin:repo_hook` scopes to the foreign repository and add it as a secret. (Default: current repository).

## Output variables

- `browser_download_url`: The publicly available URL of the asset.

## Usage

This usage assumes you want to build on tag creations only.
This is a common use case as you will want to upload release binaries for your tags.

Simple example:

```yaml
```

Complex example with more operating systems:

```yaml
```

Example with `file_glob`:

```yaml
```

Example for creating a release in a foreign repository using `repo_name`:

```yaml
```

**Example for feeding a file from repo to the `body` tag:**

This example covers following points:
* Reading a file present on the repo. For example, `release.md` which is placed in root directory of the repo.
* Modify & push the `release.md` file before triggering this action (create tag for this example) to dynamically change the body of the release.

```yaml
```

### Permissions

This actions requires writes access to the release. If you are using [granular permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions)
in your workflow, you will need to add the `contents: write` permission to the token:

```yaml
```

## Releasing

To release this Action:

- Bump version in `package.json`
- Create `CHANGELOG.md` entry
- `npm update`
- `npm run all`
- `git commit -am <version>`
- `git tag -sm <version> <version>`
- `git push --follow-tags`
- Go to https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/releases and publish the new version

## About

GitHub Action to manage labels on GitHub (create/rename/update/delete) as code.

  * [YAML configuration](#yaml-configuration)
  * [Workflow](#workflow)
* [Customizing](#customizing)
  * [inputs](#inputs)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [License](#license)

## Usage

### YAML configuration

In the repository where you want to perform this action, create the YAML file
`.github/labels.yml` (you can also set a [custom filename](#customizing)) that
looks like:

```yaml
```

* `name`, `color` and `description` are the main [GitHub label fields](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/#parameters)
* `description` can be omit if your want to keep the current one
* `from_name` allow to rename a label from one currently available on your repository

### Workflow

```yaml
```

With this workflow, the YAML configuration above on a [fresh repository](samples/original.yml),
this will:

* Skip `bug` (because same `color` and `description`)
* Skip `documentation` (because same `color` and `description`)
* Update `duplicate` (`color` is different)
* Update `enhancement` (`color` is different, keep current `description`)
* Leave `good first issue` alone (because it matches an `exclude` pattern)
* Leave `help wanted` alone (because it matches an `exclude` pattern)
* Delete `invalid`
* Delete `question`
* Rename `wontfix` to `wontfix_it` and set `color` and `description`

## Customizing

### inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys

180,"# :no_entry_sign: Close All Pull Requests

A GitHub action to automatically close all open pull requests.

## Usage

This Action closes all the pull requests on the repo. It is useful when you don\'t want to accept any kind of pull request,
for instance on a readd-only repo. The action can be triggered by any event, such as `push`, `schedule` or `pull_request`
(see below).

```yaml
```

## Inputs

- `comment` - *Optional*. Post an issue comment just before closing a pull request.

## Events

The event to choose depends on your specific needs and configurations.

The `push` event is the most suitable if your repo gets frequent updates, both via developers push
or via mirroring software. Each time a push happens, all the open pull requests will get closed.
However if you code is pretty stable, your pull requests could stay open for a while, making this
action useless.

In this case the most suitable event is `schedule`. You can schedule a check per hour, per day,
etc., on your choice. The drawback of this choice is that a lot of useless run will happen, with
some waste of resource. If you\'re taking this way, be careful to choose the right schedule that
fits your needs.

The event `pull_request` is fired as soon as a new pull request gets opened. Despite this looks
the best fit, it doesn\'t work on pull requests coming from forks, for security reasons. If your
pull requests are likely to come from this way, don\'t use this configuration, or you will receive
a fail when this action runs. Moreover if a pull request gets closed, then re-opened, the event
`pull_request` doesn\'t get fired again, leaving the PR open. A general suggestion that should fit
the most common needs are `push` + `schedule` (1 day).

182,"PHP Security Checker
====================

This action checks your `composer.lock` for known vulnerabilities in your package dependencies.

Inputs
------

* `lock` *optional* The path to the `composer.lock` file (defaults to the repository root directory).
* `format` *optional* The output format (defaults to `ansi`, supported: `ansi`, `junit`, `markdown`, `json`, or `yaml`).
* `disable-exit-code` *optional* Set it to `1` if you don't want the step to fail in case of detected vulnerabilities

Outputs
-------

* `vulns` A JSON payload containing all detected vulnerabilities

Usage
-----

If you want the step to fail whenever there is a security issue in one of your
dependencies, use this action:

    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: symfonycorp/security-checker-action@v4

To speed up security checks, you can cache the vulnerability database:

    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/cache@v2
          id: cache-db
          with:
              path: ~/.symfony/cache
              key: db
        - uses: symfonycorp/security-checker-action@v4

If the `composer.lock` is not in the repository root directory, pass is as an
input:

    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: symfonycorp/security-checker-action@v4
          with:
              lock: subdir/composer.lock

Instead of failing, you can also get the vulnerabilities as a JSON output and
do something with them in another step:

    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: symfonycorp/security-checker-action@v4
          with:
              disable-exit-code: 1
          id: security-check

# Cancel Workflow Action

This is a GitHub Action that will cancel any previous runs that are not `completed` for a given workflow.

This includes runs with a [status](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#check-runs) of `queued` or `in_progress`.

## How does it work?

When you `git push`, this GitHub Action will capture the current Branch and SHA. It will query GitHub\'s API to find previous workflow runs that match the Branch but do not match the SHA. These in-progress runs will be canceled leaving only this run, or the [latest run](#advanced-all-but-latest).

Read more about the [Workflow Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs).

## Usage

Typically, you will want to add this action as the first step in a workflow so it can cancel itself on the next push.

```yml
```

### Versioning

It is recommended to pin a specific version of this action so you don\'t automatically upgrade to the latest which could introduce breaking changes.

```yml
```

Notice there is no `v` prefix, just the `@major.minor.patch` version.

Visit [Releases](https://github.com/styfle/cancel-workflow-action/releases) to find the latest version at the top of the page.

> **Warning**
> 
> You might run into ""the `uses\' attribute must be a path, a Docker image, or owner/repo@ref"" error if you don\'t specify a version.

### Advanced: Canceling Other Workflows

In some cases, you may wish to avoid modifying all your workflows and instead create a new workflow that cancels your other workflows. This can be useful when you have a problem with workflows getting queued.

- Visit `https://api.github.com/repos/:org/:repo/actions/workflows` to find the Workflow ID(s) you wish to automaticaly cancel.
- Add a new file `.github/workflows/cancel.yml` with the following:

```yml
```

- _Note_: `workflow_id` can be a Workflow ID (number) or Workflow File Name (string)
- _Note_: `workflow_id` also accepts a comma separated list if you need to cancel multiple workflows
- _Note_: `workflow_id` accepts the value `all`, which will cancel all the workflows running in the branch


### Advanced: Pull Requests from Forks

The default GitHub token access is unable to cancel workflows for `pull_request`
when a pull request is opened from a fork. Therefore, a special setup using
`workflow_run`, which also works for `push`, is needed.
Create a `.github/workflows/cancel.yml` with the following instead and replace
""CI"" with the workflow name that contains the `pull_request` workflow:

```yml
```

### Advanced: Ignore SHA

In some cases, you may wish to cancel workflows when you close a Pull Request. Because this is not a push event, the SHA will be the same, so you must use the `ignore_sha` option.

```yml
```

### Advanced: All But Latest

Because this action can only cancel workflows if it is actually being run, it only helps if the pipeline isn\'t saturated and there are still runners available to schedule the workflow.

By default, this action does not cancel any workflows created after itself. The `all_but_latest` flags allows the action to cancel itself and all later-scheduled workflows, leaving only the latest.

```yml
```

### Advanced: Token Permissions

No change to permissions is required by default. The instructions below are for improved control over of those permissions.

By default, GitHub creates the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Actions with some read/write permissions. It may be a good practice to switch to read-only permissions by default. Visit the [dedicated documentation page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) for details.

Permissions can be set for all Jobs in a Workflow or a specific Job, see the [reference manual page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions). `cancel-workflow-action` only requires write access to the `actions` scope, so it is enough to have:

```yml
```

_Note_ : This is typical when global access is set to be restrictive. Only this job will elevate those permissions.

185,"# Netlify Deploy

This is a simple GitHub Action to deploy a static website to Netlify.

## Usage

To use a GitHub action you can just reference it on your Workflow file
(for more info check [this article by Github](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow))

```yml
```

### Inputs

As most GitHub actions, this action requires and uses some inputs, that you define in
your workflow file.

The inputs this action uses are:

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|:----:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` | `true` | N/A | The token needed to deploy your site ([generate here](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens))|
| `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` | `true` | N/A | The site to where deploy your site (get it from the API ID on your Site Settings) |
| `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_MESSAGE` | `false` | \'\' | An optional deploy message |
| `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` | `false` | `false` | Should the site be deployed to production? |
| `build_directory` | `false` | `\'build\'` | The directory where your files are built |
| `functions_directory` | `false` | N/A | The (optional) directory where your Netlify functions are stored |
| `install_command` | `false` | Auto-detected | The (optional) command to install dependencies. Runs `yarn` when `yarn.lock` is found; `npm i` otherwise |
| `build_command` | `false` | `npm run build` | The (optional) command to build static website |
| `deploy_alias` | `false` | \'\' | (Optional) [Deployed site alias](https://cli.netlify.com/commands/deploy) |


### Outputs

The outputs for this action are:

`NETLIFY_OUTPUT`

Full output of the action

`NETLIFY_PREVIEW_URL`

The url of deployment preview.

`NETLIFY_LOGS_URL`

The url of the logs.

`NETLIFY_LIVE_URL`

The url of the live deployed site.


## Example

### Deploy to production on release

> You can setup repo secrets to use in your workflows

```yml
```

### Preview Deploy on pull request

```yml
```

### Use branch name to deploy

Will deploy branches as `https://${branchName}--${siteName}.netlify.app`.

An action is used to extract the branch name to avoid fiddling with `refs/`. Finally, a commit status check is added, linking to the deployed site.

Only the default branch is built for simplicity. Use a similar workflow or standard Netlify integration for the production deployment.

```yml
```

### Deploy to Netlify only

In case of already having the deployment ready data - we can easily skip the nvm, install and build part via passing:

```
```

Build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package.

This action uses the [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) containers to
build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package. The wheels are placed in a
new directory `<package-path>/dist` and can be uploaded to PyPI in the next step of your
workflow.

This is a relatively simple and straightforward action. For more complicated use cases,
check out [PyPA/cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).

## Usage

### Example
Minimal:

```yaml
```

Using all arguments:

```yaml
```

See
[full_workflow_example.yml](https://github.com/RalfG/python-wheels-manylinux-build/blob/master/full_workflow_example.yml)
for a complete example that includes linting and uploading to PyPI.


### Inputs

| name | description | required | default | example(s) |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `python-versions` | Python version tags for which to build (PEP 425 tags) wheels, as described in the [manylinux image documentation](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux), space-separated | required | `'cp37-cp37m cp38-cp38 cp39-cp39 cp310-cp310 cp311-cp311'` | `'cp310-cp310 cp311-cp311'` |
| `build-requirements` | Python (pip) packages required at build time, space-separated | optional | `''` | `'cython'` or `'cython==0.29.14'` |
| `system-packages` | System (yum) packages required at build time, space-separated | optional | `''` | `'lrzip-devel zlib-devel'` |
| `pre-build-command` | Command to run before build, e.g. the execution of a script to perform additional build-environment setup | optional | `''` | `'sh pre-build-script.sh'` |
| `package-path` | Path to python package to build (e.g. where `setup.py` file is located), relative to repository root | optional | `''` | `'my_project'` |
| `pip-wheel-args` | Extra extra arguments to pass to the `pip wheel` command (see [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_wheel/)), passed paths are relative to `package-path` | optional | `'-w ./dist --no-deps'` | `'-w ./wheelhouse --no-deps --pre'` |

### Output
The action creates wheels, by default in the `<package-path>/dist` directory. The output
path can be modified in the `pip-wheel-args` option with the `-w` argument. Be sure to
upload only the `*-manylinux*.whl` wheels, as the non-audited (e.g. `linux_x86_64`)
wheels are not accepted by PyPI.

### Using a different manylinux container
The `manylinux2014_x86_64` container is used by default. To use another manylinux
container, append `-<container-name>` to the reference. For example:
`RalfG/python-wheels-manylinux-build@v0.7.1-manylinux2014_aarch64` instead of
`RalfG/python-wheels-manylinux-build@v0.7.1`.

188,"# Pull Request Labeler

Pull request labeler triages PRs based on the paths that are modified in the PR.

## Usage

### Create `.github/labeler.yml`

Create a `.github/labeler.yml` file with a list of labels and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) globs to match to apply the label.

The key is the name of the label in your repository that you want to add (eg: ""merge conflict"", ""needs-updating"") and the value is the path (glob) of the changed files (eg: `src/**/*`, `tests/*.spec.js`)

#### Basic Examples

```yml
```

#### Common Examples

```yml
```

### Create Workflow

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the labeler action with content:

```
```

Build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package.

This action uses the [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) container to
build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package. The wheels are placed in a
new directory `wheelhouse` and can then be uploaded to PyPI in the next step.
Currently, only the `manylinux1_x86_64` container is supported.

## Usage

### Inputs

#### python-versions (required)
Python versions for which to build (PEP 425 tags), as described in the
[manylinux image documentation](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux). This can be
one version, or a space-separated list of items.

For example: `cp36-cp36m cp37-cp37m cp38-cp38`  
Default: `cp36-cp36m cp37-cp37m cp38-cp38`

Possible version tags (as of 12 December 2019): `cp27-cp27m`, `cp27-cp27mu`,
`cp34-cp34m`, `cp35-cp35m`, `cp36-cp36m`, `cp37-cp37m`, `cp38-cp38`

#### build-requirements (optional)
Packages required at build time, space-separated  
For example: `cython` or `cython==0.29.14`

## Output
The action will create wheels in a new `wheelhouse` directory. Be sure to upload
only the `wheelhouse/*-manylinux1_x86_64.whl` wheels, as the initial
`linux_x86_64` wheels are not accepted by PyPI.

### Example usage
```yaml
```

192,"# action-zip

Action for zipping files and folders easily

## Usage

The only requirement is to use the official `actions/checkout@v2` first so the zip action has access to the repo files.

```yaml
```

In this example, after a release is published, a new file named `result.zip` will be created with both the file `manifest.json` and the folder `dist` (files included).

## Inputs

#### `files`

Files or directories to zip, relative to GITHUB_WORKSPACE environmental variable.

- **Required:** Yes

#### `dest`

Name of the output zip file.

- **Required:** No
- **Default:** result.zip

#### `recursive`

Whether to add subdirectories to simply zip all files to the root.

- **Required:** No
- **Default:** true

If for example, you do the following:

```yaml
```

All the files inside the `dist` folder will be added at the root of the zip along with `manifest.json`. By contrast, if `recursive: true` (by default), the folder `dist` is included.

Also if you want a nested file at the root, `recursive: false` is your guy.

## Troubleshooting

If you want to check that the output is the desired one I recommend you to add the following step after zipping. You will be able to download the `result.zip` file.

```yaml
```

193,"# Maven Publish GitHub Action

**GitHub Action for automatically publishing a Maven package to the Central Repository**

It's recommended to publish using the [Digipost open super pom](https://github.com/digipost/digipost-open-super-pom/tree/master), which greatly simplifies the process.

## Requirements

Add the `Digipost open super pom` to your project

```xml
```

## Usage

### Authentication

In your project's GitHub repository, go to Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. On this page, set the following variables:

- `release_version`: The version you want the project to be released with
- `sonatype_secrets`: a comma separated string that consists of `sonatype_username,sonatype_password,key_password,key_private`
    - `sonatype_username` is your projects username at Sonatype
    - `sonatype_password` is your projects password at Sonatype
    - `key_password` is the password of you gpg key to sign the deployed artfacts with. 
    - `key_private` is the actual private key encoded as base64 sign the deployed artfacts with.

These secrets will be passed as environment variables into the action, allowing it to do the deployment for you.

### Action

Create a GitHub workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/release.yml`) in your repository. Use the following configuration, which tells GitHub to use the Maven Publish Action when running your CI pipeline. The steps are self-explanatory:

```yml
```

This should be all the configuration you need. Every time you push a tag or make a release in github, the action will be run. If your `pom.xml` file contains a non-snapshot version tag and all tests pass, your package will automatically be deployed to the Central Repository.

## Development

### Implementation

The Maven Publish GitHub Action works the following way:

- When imported from a CI workflow in your project, GitHub will look for this repository's [`action.yml`](./action.yml) file. This file tells GitHub to run a new Docker container for the action and to pass in the action's input variables (GPG key and OSSRH login credentials).
- Docker will spin up a new container with Java and Maven installed (see [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile)).
- In the container, the [`entrypoint.sh`](./entrypoint.sh) script will be executed. It checks whether all required variables are defined, decodes the GPG private key and runs the Maven deploy command. Maven will use this repository's [`settings.xml`](./settings.xml) file, which instructs it to use the GPG passphrase and OSSRH credentials from the provided environment variables.


### Release new version of action

Push a tag with the new version, and also remember to replace major version tag (`v1`, `v2`, etc) to point to the latest release, which enables users to only specify the major version of the action.

<p align=""left"">
  <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg""></a>
</p>

A GitHub Action for installing, configuring and running hardware-accelerated Android Emulators on macOS virtual machines.

The old ARM-based emulators were slow and are no longer supported by Google. The modern Intel Atom (x86 and x86_64) emulators can be fast, but rely on two forms of hardware acceleration to reach their peak potential: [Graphics Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-graphics), e.g. `emulator -gpu host` and [Virtual Machine(VM) Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-vm), e.g. `emulator -accel on`. **Note:** GPU and VM Acceleration are two different and non-mutually exclusive forms of Hardware Acceleration.

This presents a challenge when running emulators on CI especially when running emulators within a docker container, because **Nested Virtualization** must be supported by the host VM which isn\'t the case for most cloud-based CI providers due to infrastructural limits.  If you want to learn more about Emulators on CI, here\'s an article [Yang](https://github.com/ychescale9) wrote: [Running Android Instrumented Tests on CI](https://dev.to/ychescale9/running-android-emulators-on-ci-from-bitrise-io-to-github-actions-3j76).

## A note on VM Acceleration and why we don\'t need HAXM anymore

According to [this documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#vm-mac), ""on Mac OS X v10.10 Yosemite and higher, the Android Emulator uses the built-in [Hypervisor.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) by default, and falls back to using Intel HAXM if Hypervisor.Framework fails to initialize."" This means that **HAXM is only needed to achieve VM Acceleration if this default Hypervisor is not available on macOS machines.**

**Note**: Manually enabling and downloading HAXM is not recommended because it is redundant and not needed (see above), and for users of macOS 10.13 High Sierra and higher: macOS 10.13 [disables installation of kernel extensions by default](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017658). Because Intel HAXM is a kernel extension, we would need to manually enable its installation on the base runner VM. Furthermore, manually trying to install HAXM on a Github Runner [brings up a popup](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/discussions/286#discussioncomment-4026120) which further hinders tests from running.

## Purpose

This action helps automate and configure the process of setting up an emulator and running your tests by doing the following:

- Install / update the required **Android SDK** components including `build-tools`, `platform-tools`, `platform` (for the required API level), `emulator` and `system-images` (for the required API level).
- Create a new instance of **AVD** with the provided [configurations](#configurations).
- Launch a new Emulator with the provided [configurations](#configurations).
- Wait until the Emulator is booted and ready for use.
- Run a custom script provided by user once the Emulator is up and running - e.g. `./gradlew connectedCheck`.
- Kill the Emulator and finish the action.

## Usage & Examples

A workflow that uses **android-emulator-runner** to run your instrumented tests on **API 29**:

```yml
```

We can also leverage GitHub Actions\'s build matrix to test across multiple configurations:

```yml
```

If you need specific versions of **NDK** and **CMake** installed:

```yml
```

We can significantly reduce emulator startup time by setting up AVD snapshot caching:

1. add a `gradle/gradle-build-action@v2` step for caching Gradle, more details see [#229](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/229)
2. add an `actions/cache@v3` step for caching the `avd`
3. add a `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to generate a clean snapshot - specify `emulator-options` without `no-snapshot`
4. add another `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to run your tests using existing AVD / snapshot - specify `emulator-options` with `no-snapshot-save`

```yml
```

## Configurations

| **Input** | **Required** | **Default** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|-|
| `api-level` | Required | N/A | API level of the platform system image - e.g. 23 for Android Marshmallow, 29 for Android 10. **Minimum API level supported is 15**. |

## Can I use this action on Github Hosted Linux VMs?

The short answer is yes but on Github-hosted Linux runners it\'s expected to be a much worse experience (on some newer API levels it might not work at all) than running it on macOS, because of the current lack of hardware acceleration support. You can get it running much faster on self-hosted Linux runners but only if the underlying instances support KVM (which most don\'t). Things might be better on the newer Larger runners but they are still in Beta. It is possible to use this Action with hardware accelerated Linux VMs hosted by a third-party runner provider.

For a longer answer please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/46).

196,"# GitHub Action - Publish Gem to Rubygems

This is a GitHub Action written to streamline the Ruby gem publication process. The action sets the Gem Credentials using `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` secret and then runs `rake release` in your project root. You can override this command by setting `RELEASE_COMMAND` environment variable to the script that creates and publishes (this is usually only the case when a repository hosts multiple gems together).

# Secrets Needed

`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` - The Rubygems API Key for an Owner of the Gem you wish to publish. You can find your API Key by looking in `~/.gem/credentials` or using the [Rubygems API](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#misc-methods).

# Environment Variables

`RELEASE_COMMAND` - By default, this will invoke `rake release` to build and publish the gem to Rubygems. Set this environment variable if you have a custom release command to be invoked.

`WORKDIR` - Sets the workdir where bundle and the release will be run

`GIT_EMAIL`/`GIT_NAME` - A git identity you wish the tags to by published by.

# Example

```yml
```

197,"# A Repo Tagging GitHub Action

This GitHub Action creates a [lightweight tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) for the repository using head of the repository. Note that if the repo is already tagged with the version then no attempt is made to tag the repo and nothing happens.

It is expected that you compute the version in another step of yout workflow. Below are some example shell commands that you can use to determine the version.


## Getting the tag from a file

Some languages allow you (or require you) to set the version in some config file. I\'ve included some example `main.yaml`s.

### Python

For `python` in `poetry` managed projects you can do something like the following:
```yaml
```

### Rust

For `rust`, you can do something like the following:
```yaml
```


### Elixir

For `elixir`, the `yaml` below can be used to read the version defined in `mix.exs` (assuming the `version` key is on it\'s own line in the `project` section of `mix.exs`):
```yaml
```

## Usage

_Note: We don\'t recommend using the @master version unless you\'re happy to test the latest changes._

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

Depending if you choose example 1 or example 2 is how crafted version bumps operate when reading the commit log.

Is recommended to use on `pull_request` instead of on commit to master/main.

_NOTE: set the fetch-depth for `actions/checkout@v2` or newer to be sure you retrieve all commits to look for the semver commit message._

### Options

**Environment Variables**

- **GITHUB_TOKEN** **_(required)_** - Required for permission to tag the repo.
- **DEFAULT_BUMP** _(optional)_ - Which type of bump to use when none explicitly provided (default: `minor`).
- **DEFAULT_BRANCH** _(optional)_ - Overwrite the default branch its read from Github Runner env var but can be overwritten (default: `$GITHUB_BASE_REF`). Strongly recommended to set this var if using anything else than master or main as default branch otherwise in combination with history full will error.
- **WITH_V** _(optional)_ - Tag version with `v` character.
- **RELEASE_BRANCHES** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (bash reg exp accepted) that will generate the release tags. Other branches and pull-requests generate versions postfixed with the commit hash and do not generate any tag. Examples: `master` or `.*` or `release.*,hotfix.*,master` ...
- **CUSTOM_TAG** _(optional)_ - Set a custom tag, useful when generating tag based on f.ex FROM image in a docker image. **Setting this tag will invalidate any other settings set!**
- **SOURCE** _(optional)_ - Operate on a relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
- **DRY_RUN** _(optional)_ - Determine the next version without tagging the branch. The workflow can use the outputs `new_tag` and `tag` in subsequent steps. Possible values are `true` and `false` (default).
- **GIT_API_TAGGING** _(optional)_ - Set if using git cli or git api calls for tag push operations. Possible values are `false` and `true` (default).
- **INITIAL_VERSION** _(optional)_ - Set initial version before bump. Default `0.0.0`. MAKE SURE NOT TO USE vX.X.X here if combined WITH_V
- **TAG_CONTEXT** _(optional)_ - Set the context of the previous tag. Possible values are `repo` (default) or `branch`.
- **PRERELEASE** _(optional)_ - Define if workflow runs in prerelease mode, `false` by default. Note this will be overwritten if using complex suffix release branches. Use it with checkout `ref: ${{ github.sha }}` for consistency see [issue 266](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action/issues/266).
- **PRERELEASE_SUFFIX** _(optional)_ - Suffix for your prerelease versions, `beta` by default. Note this will only be used if a prerelease branch.
- **VERBOSE** _(optional)_ - Print git logs. For some projects these logs may be very large. Possible values are `true` (default) and `false`.
- **MAJOR_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#major` commit message string tag.
- **MINOR_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#minor` commit message string tag.
- **PATCH_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#patch` commit message string tag.
- **NONE_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#none` commit message string tag.
- **BRANCH_HISTORY** _(optional)_ - Set the history of the branch for finding `#bumps`. Possible values `last`, `full` and `compare` defaults to `compare`.
  - `full`: attempt to show all history, does not work on rebase and squash due missing HEAD [should be deprecated in v2 is breaking many workflows]
  - `last`: show the single last commit
  - `compare`: show all commits since previous repo tag number

### Outputs

- **new_tag** - The value of the newly created tag.
- **tag** - The value of the latest tag after running this action.
- **part** - The part of version which was bumped.

> **_Note:_** This action creates a [lightweight tag](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference).

### Bumping

**Manual Bumping:** Any commit message that includes `#major`, `#minor`, `#patch`, or `#none` will trigger the respective version bump. If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.
If `#none` is contained in the merge commit message, it will skip bumping regardless `DEFAULT_BUMP`.

**Automatic Bumping:** If no `#major`, `#minor` or `#patch` tag is contained in the merge commit message, it will bump whichever `DEFAULT_BUMP` is set to (which is `minor` by default). Disable this by setting `DEFAULT_BUMP` to `none`.

> **_Note:_** This action **will not** bump the tag if the `HEAD` commit has already been tagged.

### Workflow

- Add this action to your repo
- Commit some changes
- Either push to master or open a PR
- On push (or merge), the action will:
  - Get latest tag
  - Bump tag with minor version unless the merge commit message contains `#major` or `#patch`
  - Pushes tag to github
  - If triggered on your repo\'s default branch (`master` or `main` if unchanged), the bump version will be a release tag. see [issue 266](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action/issues/266).
  - If triggered on any other branch, a prerelease will be generated, depending on the bump, starting with `*-<PRERELEASE_SUFFIX>.1`, `*-<PRERELEASE_SUFFIX>.2`, ...
  - To create a repository release you need another workflow like [automatic-releases](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-releases).

#### GitHub Action to customize artifact cleanup

Status and support

- &#x2714; stable
- &#x2714; supported
- &#x2716; no ongoing development

[![CI](/../../workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](/../../actions)

GitHub Action Artifacts are removed after [90 days](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Managing-Actions-storage-space/m-p/41424/highlight/true#M4618) by default. [GitHub now supports changing this setting](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-08-github-actions-ability-to-change-retention-days-for-artifacts-and-logs/). This action allows you to further customize the cleanup. It
- removes artifacts that are older than the specified age
- has the option to keep release (tagged) artifacts
- has the option to keep a number of recent artifacts
- [respects](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-throttling.js) GitHub's rate limit

Example use cases:
- keep all release artifacts for a year, remove non-release artifacts after 30 days
- keep the most recent 10 artifacts

## Usage

Add the following workflow to your repository and configure options.

`.github/workflows/remove-old-artifacts.yml`
```yml
```

Image Actions is a Github Action built by performance experts at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) that automatically compresses JPEGs, PNGs and WebPs in Pull Requests.\r
\r
Image Actions offers:\r
\r
- **Fast, efficient and near-lossless compression**\r
- Best image compression algorithms available ([mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips))\r
- [Ease of customisation](#Configuration): use default settings or adapt to your needs\r
- Running on demand or schedule\r
- Supports GitHub Enterprise\r
\r
...and more! \r

\r
## \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0 Usage\r
\r
1. Create a `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file in your repository with the following configuration:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
2. Open a Pull Request with added or changed imagery. Image Actions will process the files and post a comment, like so:\r
\r
![Calibre Image Actions Preview](images/image-actions-preview.png)\r
\r
3. Merge your Pull Request and enjoy lighter images or explore what\xe2\x80\x99s possible further with [configuration options](#configuration). \xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\r
\r
## \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f Configuration\r
\r
By default, Image Actions will compress images so that they\xe2\x80\x99re smaller and will leave your assets looking clear and crisp. If you want to change or expand those defaults, read on for available options.\r
\r
:warning: If you are using an older version of Image Actions referencing `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml`, we suggest you [migrate to the latest configuration format](#migrate-legacy-configuration).\r
\r
### Control image quality settings\r
\r
Add the following arguments to the workflow definition to control compression settings:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
**Options:**\r
\r
- [jpegQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r
- [jpegProgressive](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Boolean, true or false, default false.\r
- [pngQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r
- [webpQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r
\r
### Ignore paths\r
\r
Add the following argument to the workflow definition to ignore selected paths:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
`ignorePaths` accepts a comma-separated string with [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) support of paths to ignore when looking for images to compress.\r
\r
### Run compression only\r
\r
By default, Image Actions adds optimised images to the current Pull Request and posts a summary comment.\r
\r
Use the `compressOnly` option with `true` value to skip the commit and summary comment if you want to handle this separately (including for forks):\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
`compressOnly` accepts a Boolean value (true or false) and defaults to false.\r
\r
### Compress on demand or on schedule\r
\r
It is also possible to run Image Actions [on demand](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) or on a [recurring schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule). By using the `compressOnly` option, in conjunction with [`create-pull-request`](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) action by [@peter-evans](https://github.com/peter-evans), a new Pull Request will be raised if there are optimised images in a repository.\r
\r
See an example below:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
### Process Pull Requests from forked repositories\r
\r
By default, GitHub Actions do not have permission to alter forked repositories. For this reason, Image Actions only works for Pull Requests from branches in the same repository as the destination branch. There are several workarounds for this limitation:\r
\r
1. **Replace the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token) which does have permission to access forked repositories.** Be aware that this introduces potential security concerns (which is why it not available by default).\r
\r
2. **Run Image Actions only for Pull Requests in the current repository.** This approach is advised when not using Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to avoid wasting time and compute for compressions that will not be committed. Use the following configuration to check if a Pull Request belongs to the repository:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
3. **Run an additional instance of Image Actions in `compressOnly` mode on pushes to `main`, and then raise a new Pull Request for any images committed without being compressed (e.g. from a forked repository PR).** See the configuration in the below example which uses the [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) action by [@peter-evans](https://github.com/peter-evans) to open the new Pull Request (this only raises a Pull Request if any files are changed in previous steps).\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
### Combined workflow\r
\r
You can combine all of the above customisation options into one all-encompassing workflow to avoid having to set up separate workflows with a lot of duplication.\r
\r
The example below ensures the right order of task execution within Image Actions. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to reuse it, make sure to change `example/example_repo` to your repository details.\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
## \xe2\x99\xbb\xef\xb8\x8f Migrating legacy configuration\r
\r
If you are using an older version of Image Actions, we recommend checking that your settings are up-to-date.\r
\r
### Uses and `GITHUB_TOKEN` definition\r
\r
If your `calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file has a reference to `docker://` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` as follows:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
Update your configuration to:\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
### Location and name of the configuration file\r
\r
If your repository uses `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration, it should be moved into `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml`. Then delete the `image-actions.yml` file.\r
\r
### Listing `ignorePaths`\r
\r
`ignorePaths` is no longer an array and is now a comma separated list. E.g. `ignorePaths: ""node_modules/**,bin""`.\r

Gets the version number of a release branch such as release/1.2.3

This action should only be run on release branches. Here is a suggested usage with a check:

Obviously replace the **Dump step** with something more useful for your process.

It will output the version number of the release branch:

204,"# set-dnn-manifest-versions
Sets Dnn manifest package versions to a given version string

## Inputs

| Input                 | Required | Default  | Notes |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|-------|
| version               | Yes      |          |       |
| glob                  | No       | **/*.dnn | See [Patterns](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/packages/glob/README.md#patterns) for valid usage |
| skipFile              | No       | null     | glob input is ignored when this option is used.    |
| includeSolutionInfo   | No       | false    | When true, also sets the versions in any found SolutionInfo.cs file. |
| includeIssueTemplates | No       | false    | Specially for the Dnn.Platform repository to update issue templates after creating an RC.
| includePackageJson    | No       | false    | If true, will update all versions of packa
| includeDnnReactCommon | No       | false    | This option is specially meant for the Dnn.Platform repository. If true, will update all references to the react common bundle too.

## Usage example
When providing only a version, the action will update all the .dnn manifest files in the root or any subfolder.
```yaml
```

## Example with glob (optional)
You can alternatively provide your own globbing patter for files to include or exclude.

```yaml
```

## Example with skipFile (optional)
The skipfile is a text file with one glob per line for the manifest files to ignore. All other .dnn manifests not listed in the skipFile will be modified. When skipFile input is used, the glob input is ignored.

# **run-vcpkg@v11 requires vcpkg more recent than 2023-03-29 (e.g. commit id 5b1214315250939257ef5d62ecdcbca18cf4fb1c)**

# Quickstart with a C++ project template

Take a look at this [C++ project template](https://github.com/lukka/CppCMakeVcpkgTemplate/tree/v11) that applies all the following instructions, but also shows how to create a __pure__ workflow without using special GitHub action that you cannot run locally on your development machine, but directly using the tools (`CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg`, `C++` compilers) you already use daily.

# [The **run-vcpkg@v11** action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

The **run-vcpkg** action setups (and optionally runs) [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages specified in the `vcpkg.json` manifest file.
It leverages the vcpkg\'s Binary Caching backed to GitHub Action cache, delegating cache and key management to vpckg.

Special features which provide added value over a __pure__ workflow are:
  - automatic caching leveraging `vcpkg`\'s ability to store its [Binary Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/binarycaching) artifacts onto the [GitHub Action cache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) so that packages are built only once and reused in subsequent workflow runs. The user can customize the behavior by setting the environment variable `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` *before* vcpkg runs.
  - set the workflow variables `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` and `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` to let users easily running vcpkg
  in a `run` step such as `- run: vcpkg install` or `- run: vcpkg integrate install` without forcing the 
  users to set the variables manually.
  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. Customizable by the user by setting the input `logCollectionRegExps`.
  - automatic parsing of `CMake`, `vcpkg` and `gcc`, `clang`, `msvc` errors, reporting them contextually in the workflow summary by means of annotations.
  - although disabled by default (see input `doNotCache`), `run-vcpkg` can cache vcpkg\'s executable and data files to speed up subsequent workflow runs. Since bootstrapping `vcpkg` already downloads a prebuilt binary saving the time to build `vcpkg`, 
  this form of caching is useful only when the prebuilt executable is not served as it happens for the ARM platform.
  Note this cache does not contain the libraries built by vcpkg, which is instead managed by vcpkg itself.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

Good companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action and the
[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) actions.

<br>

## Quickstart with instructions

It is __highly recommended__ to use:
- [vcpkg as a submodule](#use-vcpkg-as-a-submodule-of-your-repository).
- a [vcpkg.json](#use-vcpkgs-vcpkgjson-file-to-specify-the-dependencies) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.
- a `CMakePresets.json` file.

```yaml
```

## Flowchart

Flowchart with related input in [action.yml](https://github.com/lukka/run-vcpkg/blob/main/action.yml) which let customize the flow.

```
```


## Best practices

### Use **vcpkg** as a submodule of your repository

 **It is highly suggested to pin the specific version of vcpkg you want to use to keep a consistent development experience between local and remote build environments.** This is accomplished by **using vcpkg as submodule of your Git repository**; this way the version of `vcpkg` used is implied by the commit id specified by the submodule for `vcpkg`.

### Use vcpkg\'s vcpkg.json file to specify the dependencies

The [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) is a manifest file that declaratively specifies the dependencies to be installed.
The file is being used automatically by running CMake (e.g. by using [run-cmake](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake)) when:
 - starting CMake with the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file.
 - the root CMake source directory contains a [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) file.

Or it can also be used by invoking `vcpkg install` in a directory where `vcpkg.json` is located (e.g., input `runVcpkgInstall : true`).

When conditions are satisfied, the toolchain execution starts [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages declared in the manifest file.

 **Putting this manifest-like file under source control is highly recommended as this helps to run vcpkg the same exact way locally and remotely on the build servers.**
The dependencies specified in the vcpkg.json file are installed when CMake runs (i.e. at `run-cmake` execution time).

209,"# GitHub Action: Fastlane

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/maierj/fastlane-action-test/workflows/Fastlane%20action%20test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maierj/fastlane-action-test/actions)

This action executes the lane that is passed.

## Migration to v3

* The parameter `bundle-install-path` has been removed from this action. This parameter was mostly intended to enable caching of `bundle install` results.
For that reason and also, because this action no longer installs the `Gemfile` dependencies, anyone using this action should set the `bundler-cache` parameter of the `ruby/setup-ruby` step to `true` (see [Example Usage](#example-usage)). 
* If you are using the `subdirectory` of this action, you should also set the `working-directory` of `ruby/setup-ruby`, so the action is knows where to look for the `Gemfile`.

## Inputs

### `lane`

**Required** The lane that should be executed.

### `options`

**Optional** The options that should be passed as arguments to the lane. The options should be serialized as a JSON object.

### `subdirectory`

**Optional** The relative path from the project root to the subdirectory where the fastlane folder is located.

### `verbose`

**Optional** If set to true, adds the verbose option to the fastlane command for extended log output.

### `env`

**Optional** If used, adds the env option to the fastlane command to use fastlane env files (see [Fastlane environment variables](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/other/)).

## Example Usage

Basic usage for executing a lane in the root directory without arguments.

```
```
\\
Usage for executing a lane in the root directory with arguments.
For a lane called `beta` to be called like
```
```
the workflow step should look like
```
    options: \'{ ""option1"": ""value1"", ""option2"": ""value2"" }\'
```
\\
Usage for executing a lane in a context where the fastlane folder is in a subdirectory called `ios`.

```
```
\\
Use the env option for fastlane env files:

```
```
## Support & Limitations

The action generally supports 
* `ubuntu-18.04`
* `ubuntu-20.04`
* `ubuntu-22.04`
* `macOS-10.15`
* `macOS-11`
* `macOS-12`
* `windows-2019`
* `windows-2022`

There may be further limitations depending on what your lanes are doing, but that\'s outside the scope of this action.

211,"# Github Action Build Chain

Github action build chain is a tool for github actions to build multiple projects from different repositories in a single action.
This tool is trying to solve the problem when a project depends on another project (most probably from the same organization) and one change can/should be performed in different repositories. How can we assure one specific pull request will work with the latest changes from/in the dependant/dependency projects and it won\'t break something? This is what we call **cross-repo pull requests** and **build-chain** is the way we have to solve it.

Let\'s consider you have a project hierarchy like:

![Project hierarchy](/docs/project-hierarchy.png)

and you want to upstream/downstream build whatever project from this hierarchy, **Github Action Build Chain** provides you the mechanism to easily do it.
You can check [Usage example](#usage-example).

Just defining the **build chain** flow in every project you want to trigger, the tool will get build information from `dependency-file` input and will execute every command from every project in a single github action.

## Allowed configuration files versions

- 2.1
- 2.2

## Build Chain Flows

### Cross Pull request flow

- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.

  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.
    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.

- It recursively checks out the rest of the dependant projects defined in `definition-file`.

  - For each parent dependency:
    - It will look for forked project belonging same github group as the one triggering the job.
    - It will try to checkout SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH. In case the it exists and it has a pull request over the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH it will check it out and will merge it with target branch.
    - If previous checkout fails, it will try the same with TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH this time.
    - If previous checkout fails, it will checkout TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH.
      > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.

- Once all the projects are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section for every parent dependency starting from the highest level of the hierarchy to the lowest one.

- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.

### Full Downstream flow

- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.

  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.
    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.

- It gets the full downstream project chain (the parents projects plus its children and their dependencies. At the end the whole chain) based on configuration file.
- It recursively checks out the rest of the dependant projects defined in `definition-file`.

  - For each parent dependency:
    - It will look for forked project belonging same github group as the one triggering the job.
    - It will try to checkout SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH. In case the it exists and it has a pull request over the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH it will check it out and will merge it with target branch.
    - If previous checkout fails, it will try the same with TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH this time.
    - If previous checkout fails, it will checkout TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH.
      > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.

- Once all the projects are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section for every parent dependency starting from the highest level of the hierarchy to the lowest one.

- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.

### Single Pull Request flow

- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.

  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.
    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.

- Once the project from the event is checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section.

- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.

### Branch flow

- It checks out the whole tree from the `starting-project` project input and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.

- Once the projects from the branch are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section.

- The flow will archive (in case the archiving is not skipped) a spreadsheet with the execution summary.

## How to add it to your project(s)

It is just to add the step (replacing dependencies and commands):

```
```

to your existing yaml flow definition or to create a new one. Do the same for the rest of the projects you need.

> **_Note:_** The `@actions/checkout` step is not needed since is the tool the one which is going to handle what to checkout for every project in the chain.

## Input Fields

See [action.yml](action.yml)

- **definition-file** (mandatory): `path to the file in filesystem | URL to the file`. [See more details](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader#url-format)

- **enable-parallel-execution** (optional. false by default): By enabling parallel execution, build-chain will try to detect projects that can be executed parallely without any conflicts i.e. no 2 projects where 1 depends on another will be executed parallely.

- **additional-flags** (optional. \'\' by default): The chance to define additional flags for the execution, as it is done on the CLI side. Just semicolon (;) separated, like \'--skipParallelCheckout;--skipExecution;-t (mvn .\\*)||\\$1 -s settings.xml\'.

  > ```
  > additional-flags: ""--fullProjectDependencyTree""
  > additional-flags: ""--fullProjectDependencyTree;--skipParallelCheckout""
  > additional-flags: ""--skipParallelCheckout; --fullProjectDependencyTree""
  > additional-flags: ""--skipParallelCheckout; -t (mvn .*)||$1 -s settings.xml""
  > ```

  > **_Note:_** It has a limitation, the flag values can\'t contain semicolons (;), otherwise it will be treated as a new flag.

## Pre/Post sections

It is possible to define pre and post sections in the definition-file. The idea is to have the chance to execute something before (`pre`) or after (`post`) project checkout and build command execution.

### PRE

```
```

It will be executed even before checking out projects.

#### Examples

```
```

```
```

### POST

```
```

It will be executed after executing all commands for every project and after archiving artifacts. The options are:

- `success`: it will be executed in case there\'s no error during build execution.
- `failure`: it will be executed in case there\'s any error during build execution.
- `always`: it will be always executed.

#### Examples

```
```

```
```

## Archiving Artifacts

The archive artifacts algorithm is basically copied from [actions/upload-artifact project](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) and (manually) transpiled to javascript. The usage is basically the same (the inputs are different named adding `archive-artifacts` prefix and the [Conditional Artifact Upload](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#conditional-artifact-upload) is not enabled), so why do we include this `archive artifacts` mechanism in this tool if it\'s already implemented by another tool? well, because this treats the archive artifacts mechanism for the whole build chain, so in case you define an `archive-artifacts-path` in a different project from the chain, all of them will be uploaded. If you are wondering if you are able to use `actions/upload-artifact` instead of the one we propose, the answer is \'yes\', just take into consideration the artifacts will be archived based on the definition from the project triggering the job.

The `archive-artifacts-path` input brings you the chance to specify if the path will be uploaded in case of build success (default), in case of failure or always for every single path. For example specifying something like `path/to/artifact/world.txt@failure` will archive `path/to/artifact/world.txt` in case of execution failure. You can check [Upload for different execution results](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#upload-for-different-execution-results).

### Upload an Individual File

```yaml
```

### Upload an Entire Directory

```yaml
```

### Upload using a Wildcard Pattern

```yaml
```

### Upload using Multiple Paths and Exclusions

```yaml
```

### Upload for different execution results

This is something additional to [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob)

```yaml
```

- will upload `path/output/bin/` just in case of `success`
- will upload `path2/output2/bin2/` just in case of `success`
- will upload `path/output/test-results` just in case of `failure`
- will upload `!path/**/*.tmp` in every case

### Path Wildcards

For supported wildcards along with behavior and documentation, see [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) which is used internally to search for files.

If a wildcard pattern is used, the path hierarchy will be preserved after the first wildcard pattern.

```
```

If multiple paths are provided as input, the least common ancestor of all the search paths will be used as the root directory of the artifact. Exclude paths do not effect the directory structure.

Relative and absolute file paths are both allowed. Relative paths are rooted against the current working directory. Paths that begin with a wildcard character should be quoted to avoid being interpreted as YAML aliases.

The [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) package is used internally to handle most of the logic around uploading an artifact. There is extra documentation around upload limitations and behavior in the toolkit repository that is worth checking out.

### Customization if no files are found

If a path (or paths), result in no files being found for the artifact, the action will succeed but print out a warning. In certain scenarios it may be desirable to fail the action or suppress the warning. The `if-no-files-found` option allows you to customize the behavior of the action if no files are found.

```yaml
```

### Conditional Artifact Upload

not supported (yet)

### Uploading without artifact name

You can upload an artifact with or without specifying a name

```yaml
```

If not provided, `artifact` will be used as the default name which will manifest itself in the UI after upload.

### Uploading to the same artifact

Each artifact behaves as a file share. Uploading to the same artifact multiple times in the same workflow can overwrite and append already uploaded files

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

With the following example, the available artifact (named `artifact` which is the default if no name is provided) would contain both `world.txt` and `extra-file.txt`.

### Environment Variables and Tilde Expansion

You can use `~` in the path input as a substitute for `$HOME`. Basic tilde expansion is supported.

```yaml
```

### archive-artifacts dependencies usage

The `dependencies` field allows us to define a set of projects for which we want to upload the artifacts.

- `none` only artifacts from the starting project will be uploaded
- `all` artifacts from all projects will be uploaded
- `list of projects` artifacts from only a given list of projects will be uploaded

```yaml
  dependencies: ""none""
```

```yaml
  dependencies: ""all""
```

```yaml
  dependencies: |
    projectX
    projectY
```

## Where does the upload go?

In the top right corner of a workflow run, once the run is over, if you used this action, there will be a `Artifacts` dropdown which you can download items from. Here\'s a screenshot of what it looks like<br/>
<img src=""docs/archive-artifacts-github.png"" width=""375"" height=""140"">

There is a trashcan icon that can be used to delete the artifact. This icon will only appear for users who have write permissions to the repository.

## How to clone project in more than one folder

It is possible to clone project in more than one folder specifying `clone` field. For example:

```
```

will clone the `kiegroup/appformer` in the `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER` and additionally will clone the project folder to `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/appformer-integration-test` and `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/folderx/appformer-unit-test`

Another example would be:

```
```

will clone the `group/projectx` in the `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER` and additionally will clone the project folder to `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/another-folder`


## Execution environment

The environment execution definition is part of the workflow (the `.yml` file) and it depends on the commands you require to execute. If you require to execute maven commands you will have to add the `actions/setup-java@v1` with its java version, or in case you need python commands `actions/setup-python` is the one. You can find different examples in https://github.com/YOURGROUP/YOURPROJECT/actions/new.

It could be the case where you require a very specific environment to execute your stuff as it is the case for [python3-cekit](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/tree/python3-cekit). Feel free to propose the environment you need as a pull request to this project:

- Create a branch based on `python3-cekit` one
- Modify [the Dockerfile from there](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/blob/python3-cekit/Dockerfile)

Current environments:

- **python3-cekit**: python3 + python cekit library + docker + nodejs + yarn latest stable release [Dockerfile](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/blob/python3-cekit/Dockerfile)

## Usage example

Considering the projects hierarchy:

![Project hierarchy](/docs/project-hierarchy.png)

You can check how to define build definition files from [Build Chain Configuration Reader documentation](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader)

### Mapping

Let\'s suppose

```
```

#### mapping.dependencies

It is used to define branch mapping between E and its dependencies in case `E` is `projectTriggeringTheJob`.

In case the `E:7.x` branch build or PR is triggered for this `7.x` target branch:

- A: no mapping at all, so `7.x` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)
- B: no mapping at all, so `7.x` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)
- C:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `7.x` mapping)
- D:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.D` source `7.x` mapping)
- The rest (F,G,H,...): `main` (since `mapping.dependencies.default` mapping defined for source: `7.x`)

In case the `E:main` branch build or PR is triggered for this `main` target branch:

- A: no mapping at all, so `main` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)
- B: no mapping at all, so `main` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)
- C:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `main` mapping)
- D:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `main` mapping)
- The rest (F,G,H,...): `main` (since there\'s no mapping defined for default main branch)

In case the `E:anyotherbranch` branch build or PR is triggered for this `anyotherbranch` target branch (being `anyotherbranch` whatever the branch name, except `7.x` or `main`):

- No mapping at all, just straight mapping to `anyotherbranch`.

#### mapping.dependant

It is used to define branch mapping between the rest of the projects and project A in case `E` is NOT `projectTriggeringTheJob`.

In case the `A:7.x` or any other (except `main`) branch build or PR is triggered -> `E:7.x` will be taken (since there\'s not `mapping.dependant` for `7.x` source)
In case the `A:main` branch build or PR is triggered -> `E:7.x` (due to `mapping.dependant.default` mapping)

## Docker build

You can build the `github-action-build-chain` image locally with just executing docker command:

```
```

In case you want to build it for a different openjdk version you just specify a `--build-arg OPENJDK_VERSION` argument:

```
```

## Local execution

It\'s possible to use this tool locally, just follow this steps

```
```

either `sudo` and `env GITHUB_TOKEN=...` are optional depending on your local setup.

> Keep in mind: Whenever the tool is executed from a github check run, the `Printing local execution command` section is printed with the exact command you could copy/paste in order to reproduce it locally.

### build command

The build command is used to execute the different flows locally

```shell
```

### build command: cross_pr

Execute pull-request flow

```shell
```

Example:

```shell
```

### build command: full_downstream

Execute full downstream (fdb) flow

```shell
```

Example:

```shell
```

### build command: single_pr

Execute single pr flow

```shell
```

Example: 

```shell
```

### build command: branch

Execute branch flow

```shell
```

Example:

```shell
```

### build command: resume

The `resume` command lets you continue your build from the last point of failure. When running any other `build-chain build` commands, it will produce a state file in the current working directory which will store all the data related to its execution. If you run `build-chain build resume` in the same working directory, then `build-chain` will pick up that state file, reconstruct `build-chain build`\'s previous state and continue execution from the first point of failure. Note that the tokens are not stored in the state file, so you have to pass them again to the `resume` command using the `--token` option or setting them as env variables.

To run from the current working directory

```shell
```

To run from a specific workspace

```shell
```

#### Custom Command Replacement

It is possible to define custom expression to replace commands. The expression structure is `RegEx||ReplacementEx` where:

- `RegEx`: you can define regular expression with or without literals. See [Javascript RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
- `||` just split `RegEx` from `ReplacementEx`
- `ReplacementEx`: See [Javascript String replacement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)

So basically at left side of `||` you define the regular expression where you want to apply string replacement from right side. For example, considering command `mvn clean install` in case we apply `(^mvn .*)||$1 -s ~/.m2/settings.xml` the final command will be `mvn clean install -s ~/.m2/settings.xml`

### tool command

There are some utility tools as well

```shell
```  

### tool command: plan

The `plan` command lets you execute build-chain without actually cloning or executing projects, like a dry run. This lets you verify whether build-chain will clone the correct projects, will checkout the correct branch, will merge the correct PRs and will execute the correct commands for each project. To use this command you simply have to pass the arguments that come after `build-chain build` command to `build-chain tools plan` command. For example:

If you want to see the dry run for the following `build` command:

```shell
```

then, you have to run the following `plan` command:

```shell
```

## About Commands to Execute

Just consider the library used behind the scenes in order to execute commands is [@actions/exec](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/exec), this library has a limitation at https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/b5f31bb5a25d129441c294fc81ba7f92f3e978ba/packages/exec/src/exec.ts#L27 where it tries to decide the ""tool"" to be executed, so in case you need to execute bash or windows commands like conditionals you should use it like this

### Bash
`bash -c ""my command""`
`bash -c  ""if true; then echo \'it\'s TRUE\'; else echo \'it\'s FALSE\'; fi""`

### Windows
`cmd /c ""my command""`

# v2 to v3

List of breaking changes from v2 to v3:

- v2 flow types are deprecated but still supported. Since they are deprecated they might be removed in future releases. Acceptable v3 flowtypes which are consistent across CLI and github action are:
  - cross_pr (know as pr or pull-request in v2)
  - full_downstream (know as fd or fdb in v2)
  - single_pr (know as single in v2)
  - branch
- v3 now accepts definition file version 2.2
- CLI options that have changed:
  - v2: `-df` to v3: `-f`
  - v2: `-url` to v3: `-u` or `--url`
  - v2: `-folder` to v3: `-o`
  - v2: `-cct` to v3: `-t`
  - v2: `-spc` to v3: `--skipProjectCheckout`
  - v2: `-sp` to v3: `-p`
- Project naming convention while checking out a project is now - `OWNER_PROJECT-NAME`. For example if we have `owner/some-name` the project will be checked out as `owner_some-name`. In v2 this would have been checked out as `owner_some_name`

## Using multiple git platforms

You can now define multiple git platforms to clone your projects from. Currently only GitHub, GitLab and Gerrit are supported. Refer to [build-chain-configuration-reader](#https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader#platforms-only-in-version-23) on how to define multiple platforms. The advanatge of having this is that you can build projects that are hosted on one platform along with projects that are hosted on another platform.

build-chain runs with a default platform configured. This default platform is used for projects which don\'t have a platform defined and for reading and loading configuration from the definition file.

By default, when you run build-chain as a github action the default platform configuration used is GitHub.  

When using build-chain as a CLI tool, build-chain will try to detect the default platform based on the definition file url. If it is not able to detect it from the url, it will use GitHub as the default configuration. If you want to override all of this, you will have the option to define default configuration as CLI options (currently only GitHub and GitLab have default options):

```shell
```

### Multiple git platforms example

```
```

> **_Note:_** it is possible to specify as many github/gitlab/gerrit platforms as it is required
> **_Note:_** use `github-public`, `gitlab-public` and/or `gerrit-public` identifiers for `https://github.com`, `https://gitlab.com` and/or `https://gerrit.googlesource.com` respectively, no need to define them.
> **_Note:_** use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` and/or `GERRIT_TOKEN` token for default github/gitlab/gerrit services.


## Found a regression?  

We have a built a dynamic agonistic end to end regression testing suite to avoid breaking major features that were working in previous versions. Its dynamic since all the test cases are determined by a json file that anyone can update without knowing the details about the implementation. It is agnostic since it just cares about the final executable that is produced and is not implementation specific.

If you found a regression please add it to the test.json file is the below format:

- For cli regression tests each test case is defined in [test/e2e-regression/cli/test.json](test/e2e-regression/cli/tests.json) in the format:

```typescript
```

- For action regression tests each test case is defined in [test/e2e-regression/github-action/test.json](test/e2e-regression/github-action/test.json) in the format:

```typescript
```
# Limitations

### Zipped Artifact Downloads

During a workflow run, files are uploaded and downloaded individually using the `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions. However, when a workflow run finishes and an artifact is downloaded from either the UI or through the [download api](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/artifacts/#download-an-artifact), a zip is dynamically created with all the file contents that were uploaded. There is currently no way to download artifacts after a workflow run finishes in a format other than a zip or to download artifact contents individually. One of the consequences of this limitation is that if a zip is uploaded during a workflow run and then downloaded from the UI, there will be a double zip created.

### Permission Loss

:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.

### Case Insensitive Uploads

:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.

## Github limitations

### Using secrets on a forked project Github Action

According to documentation, see [Workflows in forked repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories)

> **_Note:_** With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository. The GITHUB_TOKEN has read-only permissions in forked repositories.

Nothing but `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret can be used from a forked project Github Action workflow. So cases like this will store nothing on `${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD_BAD }}`, `${{ env.CIFS_ZID_USER }}` or `${{ env.CIFS_ZID_KEY }}` but it will properly store `GITHUB_TOKEN` on `${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD}}`

```
```

> **_Note:_** Just remember this is not a problem from the tool itself but a limitation from Github Actions in order to avoid exposing sensitive information.

### inputs usage in runs.image from action.yml

> Just in case you are interested in adapting this code or in case you want to create your own tool.

It\'s not possible to use expressions like `image: ""docker://kie-group:github-action-build-chain:{{ inputs.build-chain-build-system }}""`. This way it would be easy to dynamically select image to run with a simple `with` input from flow yml file and we could skip errors like [matrix in uses](#matrix-in-uses).
Just because of this we have to maintain different Dockerfile definitions in different branches and to tag every branch for every version we release like `python3-cekit-v1`.

## Development

### Execute CLI

```
```

### build-chain-configuration-reader dependency

The definition files are read thanks to [build-chain-configuration-reader](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader) library so in case you want to modify something from there it\'s easier if you just [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it:

- clone repository and browse to the folder
- `npm install` it
- (`sudo`) `npm link`
- and then from this project folder execute `npm link @kie/build-chain-configuration-reader`  

### Multi token usage with the help of octokit throttling  

To avoid rate limiting errors, users can pass in multiple tokens that octokit can use while making Github API calls.The idea is that when octokit gets a rate limit error for one token it will use another token from the pool and retry the same request.  

To implement this we used features and plugins from octokit itself. Using the [octokit throttling plugin](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-throttling.js), we attached hooks that are triggered whenever octokit gets a rate limit error. This hook switches out the current token with a new token from a whitelist pool of tokens (these tokens haven\'t reached their rate limit) and sets that token as the current token. The token which had reached its rate limit is then added to a blacklist where we keep track of after what time that token can become usable. Each time when this hook is triggered we also check whether a token from the blacklist is now available or not. If it is then we add it back to the whitelist for future use.

Now since we have a dynamically changing current token, we had to create a custom auth strategy for octokit. This auth strategy also installs a hook which is triggered each time octokit makes a request. So before each request, this hook adds the current token to the authorization header.

### Testing

#### unit tests
To test your changes you can run
```
```
And to test with coverage report you can run
```
```
#### e2e tests

To run e2e tests you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once you have setup docker you can run
```
```
To generate log files containing the raw output of the worflows executed during e2e tests you can run
```
ACT_LOG=true ```

212,"# \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa8 Notice

The joschi/setup-jdk GitHub Action is deprecated.

Please consider switching to the official [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) action v2 or later which also supports AdoptOpenJDK and its successor Eclipse Temurin:

https://github.com/actions/setup-java/tree/v2.5.0#basic

In order to migrate to [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) it is sufficient to replace the name of the action and set the `distribution` parameter to `temurin`.

**Before:**

```yaml
```

**After:**

```yaml
```

# setup-jdk

<p align=""left"">
  <a href=""https://github.com/joschi/setup-jdk""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/joschi/setup-jdk/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg""></a>
</p>

This action sets up a Java development environment with the OpenJDK distribution from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for use in actions by:

- Downloading and caching a version of the OpenJDK by version and adding to `PATH`. Downloads from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Registering problem matchers for error output.

The action is based on [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) and is using the [AdoptOpenJDK API](https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/) for fetching the JDK binaries.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
```

Examples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:

- A major Java version

  e.g. ```6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...```

## Local file
```yaml
```

## Matrix Testing
```yaml
```

## Publishing using Apache Maven
```yaml
```

The two `settings.xml` files created from the above example look like the following.

`settings.xml` file created for the first deploy to GitHub Packages
```xml
```

`settings.xml` file created for the second deploy to Apache Maven Central
```xml
```

***NOTE: The `settings.xml` file is created in the Actions $HOME directory. If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***

If you don\'t want to overwrite the `settings.xml` file, you can set `overwrite-settings: false`.

If `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner\'s temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.

## Publishing using Gradle
```yaml

214,"# auto-label-merge-conflicts
> A Github action to auto-label PRs with merge conflicts

## Purpose

This action checks all open Pull Requests for merge conflicts and marks them with a Github label. 

![Github action in action](./demo.png)

Once a conflict is resolved the label is automatically removed.

The typical use case is to run this action post merge (e.g. push to `master`) to quickly see which other PRs are now in conflict.
 
We use this setup e.g. on our monorepo at [Comtravo](https://github.com/comtravo). Instead of a grumpy CTO pinging developers to fix their merge conflicts there\'s now a shiny bot.

## Set up

To configure the action on your repo you have to do 2 things:

1) pick a Github label that should be used to mark PRs with conflicts
 This label will then be managed by this action. It will be added to PRs with merge conflicts and removed from PRs without conflicts.
 
2) configure the new workflow by creating a YML config file in your `.github/workflows` folder:

```yaml
```

The label from step 1 should be referenced in the parameter `CONFLICT_LABEL_NAME`

Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/mschilde/auto-label-merge-conflicts/blob/master/%2Egithub/workflows/label_merge_conflicts.yml) for an example setup.

### Arguments:

* `CONFLICT_LABEL_NAME`: label used for marking conflicts, note that such label has to exist in your repo
* `MAX_RETRIES`: optional (default 5)
* `WAIT_MS`: optional (default 5000)

## Limitations

Github does not reliably compute the `mergeable` status which is used by this action to detect merge conflicts. 

If `master` changes the mergeable status is unknown until someone (most likely this action) requests it. [Github then tries to compute the status with an async job.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30620973) 

This is usually quick and simple, but there are no guarantees and Github might have issues.
You can tweak `MAX_RETRIES` and `WAIT_MS` to increase the timeout before giving up on a Pull Request.

## Local dev setup

To play around with the code base, you need `Docker` and `make` set up locally.

Run `make build`, `make develop`, then `yarn install`.

## Examples of Usage

### Building and pushing an image

#### Before each of the following examples, make sure to include the following:
```yaml
```

#### Login to Amazon ECR Private, then build and push a Docker image:
```yaml
```

#### Login to Amazon ECR Public, then build and push a Docker image:
```yaml
```

#### Login to Amazon ECR Private, then package and push a Helm chart:
```yaml
```

#### Login to Amazon ECR Public, then package and push a Helm chart:
```yaml
```

(Helm uses the same credential store as Docker, so Helm can authenticate with the same credentials that you use for Docker)

#### Login to ECR on multiple AWS accounts

```yaml
```

The repository on account `998877665544` needs to explicitly grant access to role:
`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-github-actions-role` in order for cross-account access to work

Please refer to [AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/secondary-account-access-ecr/)
for details on how to configure ECR policies

### Using an image as a service

Login to Amazon ECR Private, then use the outputted Docker credentials to run your private image as a service in another job
```yaml
```

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs and outputs.

## Credentials

### AWS Credentials

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.  Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with a role using GitHub\'s OIDC provider and your desired region.

```yaml
```

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) when using AWS services in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
* [Assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-workloads-use-roles) to receive temporary credentials. See the [Sample IAM Role CloudFormation Template](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#sample-iam-role-cloudformation-template) in the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action to get an example.
* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#remove-credentials) of the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.

### Docker Credentials
The registry URIs for ECR Private and ECR Public are as follows:
- Registry URI for ECR Private: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.aws-region-1.amazonaws.com`
- Registry URI for ECR Public: `public.ecr.aws`

After logging in, you can access the docker username and password via action outputs using the following format:

If using ECR Private:
- Docker username output: `docker_username_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`
- Docker password output: `docker_password_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`

If using ECR Public:
- Docker username output: `docker_username_public_ecr_aws`
- Docker password output: `docker_password_public_ecr_aws`

To push Helm charts, you can also login through Docker. By default, Helm can authenticate with the same credentials that you use for Docker.

## Self-Hosted Runners

### Proxy Configuration

If you run in self-hosted environments and/or in secured environments where you need to use a specific proxy, you can set it in the action manually.

Additionally, this action will always consider an already configured proxy in the environment.

Proxy configured via action input:
```yaml
````

Proxy configured via an environment variable:
```shell
```

The action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment, and you don\'t need to configure it in the action.

## Permissions

### ECR Private

To see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).

This action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Private:

```json
```

Docker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker pull` and `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action.

The following minimum permissions are required for pulling an image from an ECR Private repository:

```json
```

The following minimum permissions are required for pushing and pulling images in an ECR Private repository:

```json
```

### ECR Public

To see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/security-iam.html).


This action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Public:

```json
```

Docker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action. There are no permissions needed for pulling images from ECR Public.

The following minimum permissions are required for pushing an image to an ECR Public repository:

```json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Configure credentials

`Inaccessible host: \'api.ecr-public.aws-region-1.amazonaws.com\' at port \'undefined\'. This service may not be available in the \'aws-region-1\' region.`

- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as a region where ECR Public isn\'t available.
- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.

`GetAuthorizationToken command is only supported in us-east-1.`

- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as `us-west-2`.
- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.

### Inputs

`Invalid parameter at \'registryIds\' failed to satisfy constraint: \'Member must satisfy constraint: [Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: [0-9]{12}]\'`

- One of the registries you provided in the `registries` input isn\'t a sequence of 12 digits
- For users providing only a single registry ID in the `registries` input, if the ID begins with a 0, make sure to enclose it in quotes. GitHub Actions will read an input as a number if all of the characters in the input are digits. So if your registry ID begins with a 0, the 0 will be truncated. See issue [#225](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login/issues/225).

## Usage

```yaml
```

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs and outputs.

### Task definition file

It is highly recommended to treat the task definition ""as code"" by checking it into your git repository as a JSON file.  Changes to any task definition attributes like container images, environment variables, CPU, and memory can be deployed with this GitHub action by editing your task definition file and pushing a new git commit.

An existing task definition can be downloaded to a JSON file with the following command.  Account IDs can be removed from the file by removing the `taskDefinitionArn` attribute, and updating the `executionRoleArn` and `taskRoleArn` attribute values to contain role names instead of role ARNs.
```sh
```

Alternatively, you can start a new task definition file from scratch with the following command.  In the generated file, fill in your attribute values and remove any attributes not needed for your application.
```sh
```

If you do not wish to store your task definition as a file in your git repository, your GitHub Actions workflow can download the existing task definition.
```yaml
```

### Task definition container image values

It is highly recommended that each time your GitHub Actions workflow runs and builds a new container image for deployment, a new container image ID is generated.  For example, use the commit ID as the new image\'s tag, instead of updating the \'latest\' tag with the new image.  Using a unique container image ID for each deployment allows rolling back to a previous container image.

The task definition file can be updated prior to deployment with the new container image ID using [the `aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition).  The following example builds a new container image tagged with the commit ID, inserts the new image ID as the image for the `my-container` container in the task definition file, and then deploys the rendered task definition file to ECS:

```yaml
```

## Credentials and Region

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.
Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
* Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code.  You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.
* [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository. Do not use the AWS account root user access key.
* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
* [Rotate the credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) used in GitHub Actions workflows regularly.
* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Permissions

This action requires the following minimum set of permissions:

```json
```

Note: the policy above assumes the account has opted in to the ECS long ARN format.

## AWS CodeDeploy Support

For ECS services that uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, additional configuration is needed for this action:

```yaml
        codedeploy-appspec: appspec.json
        codedeploy-application: my-codedeploy-application
        codedeploy-deployment-group: my-codedeploy-deployment-group
```

The minimal permissions require access to CodeDeploy:

```json
```

## Troubleshooting

This action emits debug logs to help troubleshoot deployment failures.  To see the debug logs, create a secret named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with value `true` in your repository.

220,"setup-vsdevenv
==============

[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for setting Visual Studio
build environment variables and paths for subsequent steps in the job.

This can be especially useful for building C++ using the MSVC compiler using
build tools like [CMake](https://cmake.org/) which lack the good sense to find
VS themselves.

The action can find any compatible VS installation (via required [VS components](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-and-component-ids
)), though it will still always run the `vsdevenv` command and update the
environment accordingly.

Inputs
------

- `vswhere`: Path to `vswhere.exe` (default system-installed copy).
- `arch`: Build architecture (default `amd64`).
- `host_arch`: Host architecture override.
- `winsdk`: WinSDK version override.
- `toolset_version`: Build toolset version override.
- `components`: List of required VS components, semi-colon separated.
  (default `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64`)

Outputs
-------

- `install_path`: Selected VS installation path.

[![Test](https://github.com/BSFishy/meson-build/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BSFishy/meson-build/actions)

Run a Meson task during your Actions workflow

## Usage
See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
```

All options:
```yaml
```

### Options
Here is a list of options that can be used with this action.

#### `action`
The action to perform.
This specifies what the action should actually be doing.
It defines what command is run when it comes time.

Note that the project will always be setup before an action is run.
Before the action is run, `meson setup [directory]` will be run to setup the project.
If the directory already exists and there is a file name `build.ninja` in it, this step is skipped.

It should be one of the following values:
 - `build`
  Simply build the project. This will use Ninja to automatically build the project. Apart from that, no additional tasks are run.
 - `install`
  Install the project. This will use Meson to install the project to the system.
 - `test`
  Run unit tests. This will run any unit tests defined in the Meson project, using Meson.
 - `coverage`
  Run [Gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/). This will use Meson to find the code coverage of the project.
  Note that this required Gcovr. If it is not already installed, it will be installed automatically.
 - `tidy`
  Run [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) on the project. This will use Meson to lint the project.
  Note that this requires Clang-Tidy. If it is not installed, an error will occur.

#### `directory`
The directory to build the project in.
This will automatically cause all of the commands to run the commands on whatever directory is specified here.
By default, the build directory will simply be `build`.

The build directory can already exist.
If the build directory exists before the action is run, it is checked for a `build.ninja` file.
If the directory and the `build.ninja` file already exist, nothing is done to setup the project.
If either of them are missing, the project is setup using `meson setup`.

#### `setup-options`
Options to pass when setting up the project.
These are command line arguments that are passed to Meson when setting up the project.
This happens when either the `directory` specified or the `build.ninja` inside of the directory does not already exist.
This allows you to specify specific options to Meson to build with.
The options are passed directly to `meson setup`.

#### `options`
Options to pass to the Meson command.
These are command line arguments that are passed to whatever Meson command is to be called.
This allows you to run the command with specific options.
The options are passed directly to whatever command is run without formatting.

#### `meson-version`
The version of Meson to install.
Whenever the action is initially run, it checks if Meson is installed.
If Meson is already installed, this part is skipped.
Note that this means that it won't garuantee that a specific version of Meson is installed.
If Meson is not installed when the action is run, it will install it using pip and this version.

#### `ninja-version`
The version of Ninja to install.
Whenever the action is initially run, it checks if Ninja is installed.
If Ninja is already installed, this part is skipped.
Note that this means that it won't garuantee that a specific version of Ninja is installed.
If Ninja is not installed when the action is run, it will be installed using pip and this version.

#### `gcovr-version`
The version of Gcovr to install.
Whenever the `coverage` action is run, Gcovr is checked if it is installed.
If not, pip will be used to install this version of Gcovr.

### Additional info
Here is just a little bit of additional information to explain some things that may not be trivial.

#### Lifecycle
The lifecycle of the action is fairly important.
Luckily, it is fairly simple.
Here is what it looks like:

 1. Process the inputs.
  First, we need to get all of our inputs and figure out what exactly they are. The main part of this step is to format the `action` input. We just need to make sure it is a valid value.
 2. Check for Ninja.
  Next, we need to make sure Ninja is installed. Ninja is a dependency of Meson, so we do a simple check if it is on the current system. If not, it is installed through pip.
 3. Check for Meson.
  We also need to make sure Meson is installed. If Meson is not already installed, it is installed through pip.
 4. Check if the project is setup.
  We need to check if the project is setup. This will check if the build directory exists and if the `build.ninja` file exists in that directory. If either of those are missing, a `meson setup` command will be called to setup the project. If either of those are missing even after running the setup command, it is assumed that the project has an error, and it exits.
 5. Build the command.
  Next, we build the command that is to be run. Based on the action to run, an executable and basic set of arguments are selected that correspond to that command. Any dependencies (i.e. Gcovr or Clang-Tidy) are also installed if their respective actions are used. Finally, the `options` input is appended to the arguments.
 6. Run the command.
  Finally, we run the command that was built in the previous step.

# Setup MSYS2

**setup-msys2** is a GitHub Action (GHA) to setup an [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment (i.e. MSYS,
MINGW32, MINGW64, UCRT64, CLANG32, CLANG64 and/or CLANGARM64 shells)

It provides:

* Easy installation and updates
* Easy package installation including caching for faster re-runs
* A shell helper for running your commands or your whole job in an MSYS2 environment

## Usage

```yaml
```

Then, for scripts:

```yaml
```

It is also possible to execute specific commands from cmd/powershell scripts/snippets.
In order to do so, `-c` is required:

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

### Default shell

In order to reduce verbosity, it is possible to set `msys2` as the default shell. For example:

```yaml
  defaults:
    run:
      shell: msys2 {0}
  steps:
    with:
      update: true
      install: >-
        curl
        git
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

### Build matrix

It is common to test some package/tool on multiple environments, which typically requires installing different sets of
packages through option `install`.
GitHub Actions\' `strategy` and `matrix` fields allow to do so, as explained in [docs.github.com: Configuring a build matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix)
and [docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix).
See, for instance:

```yml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - { sys: mingw64, env: x86_64 }
        - { sys: mingw32, env: i686 }
        - { sys: ucrt64,  env: ucrt-x86_64 }
        - { sys: clang64, env: clang-x86_64 }
  steps:
        with:
        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
        install: mingw-w64-${{matrix.env}}-openssl
```

Alternatively, option `pacboy` allows using a single matrix variable:

```yml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      sys:
        - mingw64
        - mingw32
        - ucrt64
        - clang64
  steps:
        with:
        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
        pacboy: openssl:p
```

Furthermore, [.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml](.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml) is a [Reusable Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)
to build and test a package in GitHub Actions using a PKGBUILD recipe.
It can be used along with [matrix](./matrix) (a [Composite Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)),
as shown in [.github/workflows/Tool.yml](.github/workflows/Tool.yml).

Note: By default, GitHub Actions terminates any running jobs if any job in matrix
fails. This default behavior can be disabled by setting `fail-fast: false` in
strategy section. See
[docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategyfail-fast)
for more details.

Find similar patterns in the following workflows:

- [examples/cmake.yml](examples/cmake.yml)
- [msys2/MINGW-packages: .github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)

Find further details at [#171](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/171#issuecomment-961458598) and [#102](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/102).

### Options

#### msystem

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `MSYS | MINGW64 | MINGW32 | UCRT64 | CLANG32 | CLANG64 | CLANGARM64`
* Default: `MINGW64`

The default [environment](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) that is used in the `msys2` command/shell provided by this action.

MSYS2 recommends `UCRT64` nowadays as the default instead of `MINGW64`.

For example:

```yaml
    with:
      msystem: UCRT64
```

The environment can be later overridden using the `MSYSTEM` environment variable if needed.
This is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts.
For example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:

```yaml
    with:
      msystem: MSYS
  - shell: msys2 {0}
    run: |
      makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar
      pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz
  - run: |
      set MSYSTEM=UCRT64
      msys2 -c \'<command to test the package>\'
```

#### update

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

By default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball.
By setting option `update` to `true`, the action will update the package database and all already installed packages.

```yaml
    with:
      update: true
```

#### install

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: a whitespace separated list of packages
* Default: -

Installing additional packages after updating the system is supported through option `install`.
The package or list of packages are installed through `pacman --noconfirm -S --needed --overwrite *`.

```yaml
    with:
      update: true
      install: >-
        git
        curl
```

#### pacboy

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: s whitespace separated list of packages
* Default: -

Installing additional packages with [pacboy](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/#avoiding-writing-long-package-names) after updating the system is supported through option `pacboy`.
The package or list of packages are installed through `pacboy --noconfirm -S --needed`.

```yaml
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix:
      sys: [ MINGW64, MINGW32, UCRT64, CLANG64 ]
  steps:
    with:
      msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
      install: >-
        git
        curl
      pacboy: >-
        openssl:p
```

#### platform-check-severity

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `warn | fatal`
* Default: `warn`

By default (`fatal`), throw an error if the runner OS is not Windows.
If set to `warn`, simply log a message and skip the rest:

```yaml
    with:
      platform-check-severity: warn
```

### Advanced Options

These options are rarely needed and shouldn\'t be used unless there is a good reason.

#### path-type

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `minimal | strict | inherit`
* Default: `minimal`

Defines which parts of the Windows `$env:PATH` environment variable leak into the MSYS2 environment.
Allowed values:

- `strict`: do not inherit anything from `$env:PATH`.
- `minimal` *(default)*: only inherit the default Windows paths from `$env:PATH` (so that `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`
  are available for example).
- `inherit`: inherit everything; warning: this can lead to interference with other tools installed on the system.

```yaml
    with:
      path-type: minimal
```

This option corresponds to the `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE` setting in MSYS2; hence it can be overridden per step through `env`.
See [msys2/MSYS2-packages: filesystem/profile](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/blob/915946a637e1f2b7e26e32782f3af322009293db/filesystem/profile#L28-L45)
for further details about the configuration of each option.

#### cache

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

By default (`true`), caches various things between runs to make repeated runs faster.

```yaml
    with:
      cache: false
```

#### location

* Type: `string`
* Default: -

Specify an alternate location where to install MSYS2 to.

```yaml
    with:
      location: D:\\
```

#### release

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

If `true` (the default) it makes a fresh install of the latest MSYS2 installer release.
If `false` it will try to re-use the [existing MSYS2 installation](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#msys2) which is part of the official [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).

```yaml
    with:
      release: false
```

## Known Problems

### actions/checkout and line endings

In case you use the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action in your workflow and haven\'t configured git attributes for line endings, then git might auto convert your text files in the git repo to Windows line endings, which might lead to problems with tools provided by MSYS2.

To work around this issue disable the auto conversion before running `actions/checkout`:

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Gr1N/setup-poetry/workflows/default/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gr1N/setup-poetry/actions?query=workflow%3Adefault)

This action sets up a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for use in actions by installing a version of Poetry and adding to PATH. The action will fail if no matching versions are found.

This action supports versions of:

- Python `>=3.7`
- Poetry `>=1.0`

## Changelog

### v8

- Action updated to use Node 16
- Support for Python 3.10 and 3.11
- **Breaking Change**, removed support for Python 3.6

### v7

- **Fix**, support MacOS platform #21

### v6

- Support Windows platform #19

### v5

- **Breaking Change**, support new Poetry installation script. According to the official documentation it\'s primarily designed to work with Poetry 1.2 and higher. It also works with earlier versions of Poetry but some features may be unsupported like `self update` #16
- **Breaking Change**, remove passed version coercion, for example, version `1.0` from `v5` will not be coerced to `1.0.0`. So, from `v5` it\'s required to specify a full and valid version of Poetry desired to be installed #16

## Usage

### Install latest available version of Poetry

```yaml
```

### Exact version of Poetry to install, using SemVer\'s version syntax

```yaml
```

### Allow to install prerelease versions of Poetry

```yaml
```

### Cache dependencies to speed up workflows

```yaml
```

### Configure Poetry using environment variables

Poetry can be configured using environment variables and in case of CI/CD it can be a preferred way for you.

A full list of available settings can be found at [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#using-environment-variables).

```yaml
    env:
      POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_PATH: /path/to/virtualenvs/directory
      POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_MY_REPOSITORY_PASSWORD: secret

229,"# GitHub Action to deploy an MkDocs site to GitHub Pages

![GitHub Badge](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This GitHub action will deploy your [MkDocs site](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme. It assumes that an `mkdocs.yml` file is present in the top-level directory and the source files (Markdown, etc.) are in the `docs/` folder. You can use [mhausenblas/mkdocs-template](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mkdocs-template) as a template.

> Before you start, make sure you enable GitHub pages via the repo settings.

There are two methods for generating and building your `gh-pages` branch: use either a `PERSONAL_TOKEN` which is loaded with a personal access token containing *repo* privileges, or using `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is a token provided by the GITHUB API with sufficient privileges to perform repo-related operations.

### Building with `PERSONAL_TOKEN`

[Generate a personal access token (scope `repo`)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and [create a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository settings with the name `PERSONAL_TOKEN` and the value of the token generated.

Note that this is an account-level token that has access to update **any** repo owned by you, so be sure to avoid sharing it.

### Building with `GITHUB_TOKEN`

This action supports building and deploying with a `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This token is automatically generated by Github Actions when a workflow runs so it is convenient.

It is more **secure** than a personal token, since you never actually see the value of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and also the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to only work for a **single** repo.

You may need to give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permission. Go to your repository's **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions** and select **Read and write permissions**.

Note that for this approach, Github Pages will be enabled in Settings but you will _not_ have a URL displayed or environment tab yet. So change the Github Pages settings to another target and then back again to `gh-pages` (if that is your branch to serve) - then you will see a URL. This step is only needed on the _first_ deploy and no action is needed later on.

### Alternative `GITHUB_DOMAIN`

In case this action should be used in a Github Enterprise environment you can overwrite the `github.com` domain with your corresponding Github Enterprise domain name by specifying the `GITHUB_DOMAIN` environment variable.

### Custom domain for github pages

MkDocs can be deployed to github pages using a custom domain, if you populate a `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` environment variable. This will generate a CNAME file, which will be placed inside the `/docs` folder.

https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#custom-domains

### Custom File Pathing of Mkdocs file

This action supports deployment of mkdocs with different file path , if you populate a `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. This is important if you have mkdocs file in another folder such as if you have `mkdocs.yml` in a path `docs/mkdocs.yml`. Without populating this, the deployment assumes that `mkdocs.yml` is on the root folder.

## Installing extra packages

Some Python packages require C bindings. These packages can be installed using the `EXTRA_PACKAGES` variable. The `EXTRA_PACKAGES` variable will be passed to the `apk add` command of Alpine Linux before running `pip install` to install the Python packages.

## Installing mkdocs plugins

If you use some mkdocs plugins like [`codeinclude`](https://github.com/rnorth/mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin) then you need to define it as dependency in the typical python way with a `requirements.txt` file. In the sample above you need to add the line `mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin`. Then you need to link the file using the `REQUIREMENTS` variable.

230,"# auto-label

> A GitHub action to add labels to Pull Request based on matched file patterns

## Installation

To configure the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/workflows/auto-label.yml` file:

```yaml
```

NOTE: `pull_request` event is triggered by [many actions](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent), so please make sure to filter by `[opened, synchronize]` of [on.<event_name>.types](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onevent_nametypes) as in the example above.

And configure by creating `.github/auto-label.json` file.
The format is `label: rule`:

```ts
```

Pattern matching is following `.gitignore` [spec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) using by [node-ignore](https://github.com/kaelzhang/node-ignore).

```json
```

## Features

* Remove label in the PR if the file has been removed.
* If there\'s no adding / removing labels, it will only consumes 1 point of rate limit score.
  * https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/resource-limitations/

## Tips

* In case if you want to debug the response quickly, just set `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` as `true` on Secrets from Settings of GitHub.

### TODO

* Handle pagination of label (currently only handles 100)

It can backport [rebased and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests with a single commit and [squashed and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests.
It thus integrates well with [Autosquash](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autosquash).

# Usage

1.  :electric_plug: Add this [.github/workflows/backport.yml](.github/workflows/backport.yml) to your repository.

2.  :speech_balloon: Let's say you want to backport a pull request on a branch named `production`.

    Then label it with `backport production`. (See [how to create labels](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-label/).)

3.  :sparkles: That's it! When the pull request gets merged, it will be backported to the `production` branch.
    If the pull request cannot be backported, a comment explaining why will automatically be posted.

_Note:_ multiple backport labels can be added.
For example, if a pull request has the labels `backport staging` and `backport production` it will be backported to both branches: `staging` and `production`.

# Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript

Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a JavaScript action.:rocket:

This template includes compilication support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.  

If you are new, there\'s also a simpler introduction.  See the [Hello World JavaScript Action](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action)

## Create an action from this template

Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action

## Code in Master

Install the dependencies  
```bash
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  
```bash
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder. 

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml)])

```yaml
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Uploading coverage to Codacy

Before setting up Codacy Coverage Reporter GitHub Action you must have tests and use tools to [generate coverage reports](https://docs.codacy.com/coverage-reporter/#generating-coverage) for the source code files in your repository.

To upload coverage to Codacy using the GitHub Action using default settings:

1.  Set up an API token to allow the GitHub Action to authenticate on Codacy:

    -   **If you\'re setting up one repository**, [obtain a project API token](https://docs.codacy.com/codacy-api/api-tokens/#project-api-tokens) and store it as an [encrypted secret for your **repository**](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the name `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN`.
    -   **If you\'re setting up multiple repositories**, [obtain an account API token](https://docs.codacy.com/codacy-api/api-tokens/#account-api-tokens) and store it as an [encrypted secret for your **organization**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-organization) with the name `CODACY_API_TOKEN`.

    > \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f **Never write API tokens to your configuration files** and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy.

2.  [Generate a supported code coverage report](https://docs.codacy.com/coverage-reporter/#generating-coverage) on each push to your repository.

3.  Add the following to a file `.github/workflows/codacy-coverage-reporter.yaml` in your repository, where `PATH_TO_REPORT` is the path to the coverage report:

    ```yaml
    name: Codacy Coverage Reporter

This is a GitHub action to read from java `.properties` files.

**Note:** It will work for all file-types that follow the `key=value` pattern.

> If you are also looking for an action that enables you to **write** values to `.properties` files use
> [Write Properties action](https://github.com/christian-draeger/write-properties)


## Inputs

### `path`

**Required** The path to properties file to read.

### `properties`

**Required** The properties you want to read. Space separated

## Outputs

For each provided property, one output of the same name exists. Because the names of outputs can only contain alphanumeric characters, `-` and `_`, any other character is replaced by a `-`.

## Example usage

    - name: Read value from Properties-file
      id: read_property
      uses: christian-draeger/read-properties@1.1.1
      with:

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/all-contributors/EndBug/add-and-commit)](#contributors-)

You can use this GitHub Action to commit changes made in your workflow run directly to your repo: for example, you use it to lint your code, update documentation, commit updated builds, etc...

## Inputs

Add a step like this to your workflow:

```yaml
```

### Git arguments

Multiple options let you provide the `git` arguments that you want the action to use. It\'s important to note that these arguments **are not actually used with a CLI command**, but they are parsed by a package called [`string-argv`](https://npm.im/string-argv), and then used with [`simple-git`](https://npm.im/simple-git).  
What does this mean for you? It means that strings that contain a lot of nested quotes may be parsed incorrectly, and that specific ways of declaring arguments may not be supported by these libraries. If you\'re having issues with your argument strings you can check whether they\'re being parsed correctly either by [enabling debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging) for your workflow runs or by testing it directly with `string-argv` ([RunKit demo](https://npm.runkit.com/string-argv)): if each argument and option is parsed correctly you\'ll see an array where every string is an option or value.

### Adding files

The action adds files using a regular `git add` command, so you can put every kind of argument in the `add` option. For example, if you want to force-add a file: `./path/to/file.txt --force`.  
The script will not stop if one of the git commands doesn\'t match any file. E.g.: if your command shows a ""fatal: pathspec \'yourFile\' did not match any files"" error the action will go on.  
You can also use JSON or YAML arrays (e.g. `\'[""first"", ""second""]\'`, `""[\'first\', \'second\']""`) to make the action run multiple `git add` commands: the action will log how your input has been parsed. Please mind that your input still needs to be a string because of how GitHub Actions works with inputs: just write your array inside the string, the action will parse it later.

### Deleting files

The `remove` option can be used if a predetermined list of files needs to be removed. It runs the `git rm` command, so you can pass every kind of argument with it. As if with the [`add` input](#adding-files), you can also use JSON or YAML arrays to make the action run multiple `git rm` commands.
 
If you want deleted files to be auto-detected and committed, you can use the [`--no-ignore-removal`/`-A`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt--A) git arguments.

### Pushing

By default the action runs the following command: `git push origin ${new_branch input} --set-upstream`. You can use the `push` input to modify this behavior, here\'s what you can set it to:

- `true`: this is the default value, it will behave as usual.
- `false`: this prevents the action from pushing at all, no `git push` command is run.
- any other string:  
  The action will use your string as the arguments for the `git push` command. Please note that nothing is used other than your arguments, and the command will result in `git push ${push input}` (no remote, no branch, no `--set-upstream`, you have to include them yourself).

One way to use this is if you want to force push to a branch of your repo: you\'ll need to set the `push` input to, for example, `origin yourBranch --force`.

### Creating a new branch

If you want the action to commit in a new branch, you can use the `new_branch` input.

Please note that if the branch exists, the action will still try push to it, but it\'s possible that the push will be rejected by the remote as non-straightforward.

If that\'s the case, you need to make sure that the branch you want to commit to is already checked out before you run the action.  
If you\'re **really** sure that you want to commit to that branch, you can also force-push by setting the `push` input to something like `origin yourBranchName --set-upstream --force`.

If you want to commit files ""across different branches"", here are two ways to do it:

1. You can check them out in two different directories, generate your files, move them to your destination and then run `add-and-commit` in the destination directory using the `cwd` input.
2. You can manually commit those files with `git` commands as you would on your machine. There are several ways to do this depending on the scenario. One of them if to stash your changes, checkout the destination branch, and popping the stash. You can then use the `add-and-commit` action as usual. Please note that this is just an example and may not work for you, since your use case may be different.

### Tagging

You can use the `tag` option to enter the arguments for a `git add` command. In order for the action to isolate the tag name from the rest of the arguments, it should be the first word not preceded by an hyphen (e.g. `-a tag-name -m ""some other stuff""` is ok).  
You can also change the arguments of the push command for tags: every argument in the `tag_push` input will be appended to the `git push --tags` command.  
For more info on how git arguments are parsed, see [the ""Git arguments"" section](#git-arguments).

## Outputs

The action provides these outputs:

- `committed`: whether the action has created a commit (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)
- `commit_long_sha`: the full SHA of the commit that has just been created
- `commit_sha`: the short 7-character SHA of the commit that has just been created
- `pushed`: whether the action has pushed to the remote (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)
- `tagged`: whether the action has created a tag (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)
- `tag_pushed`: whether the action has pushed a tag (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)

For more info on how to use outputs, see [""Context and expression syntax""](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

## FAQs

### Working with PRs

By default, when you use `actions/checkout` on a PR, it will checkout the head commit in a detached head state.
If you want to make some changes, you have to checkout the branch the PR is coming from in the head repo.  
You can set it up like this:

```yaml
```

You can find the full docs for payloads of `pull_request` events [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#webhook-payload-example-32).

If you\'re planning on running this only on ""internal"" PRs (where head and base are in the same repo) then you can omit the `repository` input.  
If you\'re planning to use this with PRs coming from other forks, please keep in mind that you might not have write access to those repos.
You can try setting up the repo with your PAT, as explained in the [""About tokens"" paragraph](#about-tokens) of this section.

Keep in mind that this ""custom checkout"" is meant only for PRs: if your workflow runs on multiple events (like `push` or `workflow_dispatch`), you could try having this step run only for `pull_request` events, while other ones will trigger the usual checkout.  
If you wish to do so, you can use the `step.if` property, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif)\'s the docs.

### About tokens

When pushing, the action uses the token that the local git repository has been configured with: that means that if you want to change it you\'ll need to do it in the steps that run before this action. For example: if you set up your repo with [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/) then you have to add the token there.  
Changing the token with which the repo is configured can be useful if you want to run CI checks on the commit pushed by this action; anyway, it has to be set up outside of this action.

The action automatically gets the GitHub token from a `github_token` input: this input should not be modified by the user, since it doesn\'t affect the commits as it\'s only used to access the GitHub API to get user info, in case they selected that option for the commit author.

### The commit from the action is not triggering CI!

That\'s because you\'re checking out the repo using the built-in [`GITHUB_TOKEN` secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication): GitHub sees that the push event has been triggered by a commit generated by CI, and doesn\'t run any further checks to avoid unintentional check loops.

**If you\'re sure** that you want the commits generated during CI to trigger other workflow runs, you can checkout the repo using a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token): this will make the resulting commit the same as if you made it yourself.  
If you\'re using `actions/checkout`, check out their [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to set your repo token.

### About `actions/checkout`

The token you use when setting up the repo with this action will determine what token `add-and-commit` will use.  
Some users reported that they were getting an error:

```
```

If you\'re getting this error and you\'re using `actions/checkout@v1`, try upgrading to `actions/checkout@v2`. If you\'re still having problems after upgrading, feel free to open an issue. Issue ref: [#146](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit/issues/146)

### Performance on large repos

By default, the action will fetch the repository before starting to work on it: this ensures that it can see the already existing refs.  

When working with a repository that has a lot of branches and tags, fetching it can take a long time. If the fetch step is taking too much time, you can decide to skip it by setting the `fetch` input to `false`: this will prevent the action from running `git fetch` altogether. 

Please note that you have to set up your workflow accordingly: not fetching the repo can impact branch and tag creation within the action, and for this reason it\'s recommended to disable it only if necessary. Issue ref: [#386](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit/issues/386)

## Examples

### Different author/committer configurations

If you don\'t want to use your GitHub username for the CI commits, you can use the `default_author` input to make it appear as if it was made by ""GitHub Actions"", by setting its value to `github_actions`.

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/115738624-80b51780-a38d-11eb-9bbe-77461654274c.png"" height=40/>

```yaml
```

You can also use the `committer_name` and `committer_email` inputs to make it appear as if GitHub Actions is the committer, here are a couple of example steps:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/130594168-1d910710-e2d0-4b06-9324-cbe5dde59154.png"" height=70/>

```yaml
```

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/130594443-b881fae7-3064-4020-a4cc-6db37ef0df65.png"" height=70/>

```yaml
```

### Automated linting

Do you want to lint your JavaScript files, located in the `src` folder, with ESLint, so that fixable changes are done without your intervention? You can use a workflow like this:

```yaml
```

### Running the action in a different directory

If you need to run the action on a repository that is not located in [`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables), you can use the `cwd` option: the action uses a `cd` normal command, so the path should follow bash standards.

```yaml
```

238,"# Release Ruby Gem to GitHub Packages
This action builds the gems for all `.gemspec` files in the projects root and uploads them to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) (or optionally specify a subdirectory to build from).

## Usage
Example minimal workflow using this action:
```yaml
```

See example project using this action at [https://github.com/jstastny/testgem](https://github.com/jstastny/testgem).

## Inputs

| Name                | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token`             | GitHub token that has write access to Packages. You can use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`              |
| `owner`             | Name of the user or organization account that owns the repository containing your project       |
| `working-directory` | Optional parameter of the directory where you wish to build your gemspecs in (defaults to root) |

## Versioning your gem

This action currently does not bump the gem's version when building it. It is up to you to do it (either manually or in a previous workflow step).
If you try to release gem in the same version that already exists, the step will fail.

In case you want to ignore these types of failures, you can add:
```
```
to the build step configuration.

239,"# Publish gem Github Action

An action that builds and then publishes a Ruby gem to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org) or GitHub Packages.

Will find every `.gemspec` file in current directory and publish a gem for it.

Runs on `ubuntu` and `macos`.

## Usage

```yaml
```

> It is possible to publish both to RubyGems and GitHub Packages

240,"# MySQL GitHub Action [![Test status](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/actions)

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) sets up a MySQL database in Docker.

It supports various MySQL options to accurately configure and execute MySQL. So it may not be your best choice when you just want to run a simple MySQL, see [The Default MySQL](#the-default-mysql).

It is based on the Docker container and is limited by Github Actions, which contains only Linux now. Therefore it does not work in Mac OS and Windows environment.

## Usage

```yaml
```

If want bind MySQL host port to 3306, please see [The Default MySQL](#the-default-mysql).

See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) for available MySQL versions.

See [Creating and using secrets (encrypted variables)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) for hiding database password.

## The Default MySQL

MySQL *may* be installed and started by Github Actions (aka. the Default MySQL), that version is 5.7 generally, root superuser password is ""root"" and port is 3306. See [Software in virtual environments for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions).

So before set-up a MySQL which host port is 3306 in Docker, please make sure the Default MySQL has been shutted-down. Otherwise, action will fail and print an error log that looks like: `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use.` (See [#2](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/issues/2))

Sure, if you do not care about MySQL options, such as version, bound port, character set, character collation, root password, etc., you can use the Default MySQL instead of this Action.

### Shutdown the Default MySQL

241,"# GitHub Action for Sleeping \xf0\x9f\x92\xa4

## \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This action is unmaintained.

> This action was published way back in the GitHub Actions beta and is largely abandoned now, mostly because there are much better ways to pause a job than building a whole Docker container on each run (which only works on Linux jobs, too). I highly recommend replacing this action with the following code snippets.
>
> On Linux and macOS runners, use [the `sleep` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sleep):
>
```yaml
```
>
> On Windows runners, use [the `Start-Sleep` command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/start-sleep?view=powershell-7.1):
>
```yaml

This is a very, very simple (and small \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0only ~1.2 MB thanks to [`busybox`](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox)) action to wait a specified amount of time before moving on in your workflow.

Input follows the Linux `sleep` syntax for time units: a number followed by `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, etc. [Man page for `sleep` here.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sleep)
