485,"# GitHub Action for Zikula modules

This repository contains a GitHub Action for building and testing Zikula modules.

For more information about Zikula visit [it\'s project repository](https://github.com/zikula/core/).

This action downloads and installs a specific Zikula core version in order to check and test a module.

## Inputs

1. Name of vendor. Example: `Acme`.
2. Name of module without vendor and `Module` suffix. Example: `News`.
3. Version of module using SemVer notation. Example: `1.0.0`.
4. The Zikula version which should be used. Must be one of the following options:
    - `ZK30` - Targets the last stable Zikula 3.0.x version.
    - `ZK3DEV` - Targets the last unstable Zikula 3.x version (Git branch).
    - `ZK20` - Targets the last stable Zikula 2.0.x version.
    - `ZK2DEV` - Targets the last unstable Zikula 2.x version (Git branch).
    - `ZK15` - Targets the last stable Zikula 1.5.x version.
    - `ZK15DEV` - Targets the last unstable Zikula 1.5.x version (Git branch).
5. Path to the directory containing the `extensions/` folder (including trailing slash). Default `""""`.
6. Whether to create module archives as build artifacts (set to `true`). Default `false`.
7. Host of database. Default `mysql`.
    - Note that during a workflow\'s execution all containers (job, service, actions) get attached to the same user defined bridge network on the host, meaning all the containers can reach each other over that network, not via the host\'s localhost networking. Thus, this action connects to your database using the name of the corresponding service as hostname.
8. Port of database. Default `3306`.
    - Note this is the default port (read explanation for `database_host` above).
9. User of database. Default `zikula`.
10. Password of database. Default `zikula`.
11. Name of database. Default `zikula`.
12. Comma-separated list of desired analysis tools or `all` for all tools.
    - Can be used to improve performance by skipping unwanted tools.
    - Ensure that it also contains a comma at the start and the end.
    - Default value: `"",php-parallel-lint,lint:container,lint:yaml,lint:twig,translations,doctrine-info,php-cs-fixer,phpunit-bridge,security-checker,phploc,phpmetrics,php-coupling-detector,""`.

```

A sample project using this GitHub Action can be found [here](https://github.com/Guite/test-actions).

## Usage without GitHub Actions

The Docker image for this action is built automatically and located here: <https://hub.docker.com/r/guite/zikula-action>.

486,"# MariaDB GitHub Action

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) sets up a MariaDB database.

It is based on the Docker container and is limited by Github Actions, which contains only Linux now. Therefore it does not work in Mac OS and Windows environment.

## Usage

```yaml
```

See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) for available versions.

See [Creating and using secrets (encrypted variables)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) for hiding database password.

## The Default MySQL

MySQL *may* be installed and started by Github Actions (aka. the Default MySQL), that version is 5.7 generally, root superuser password is ""root"" and port is 3306. See [Software in virtual environments for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions).

So before set-up a MySQL which host port is 3306 in Docker, please make sure the Default MySQL has been shutted-down. Otherwise, action will fail and print an error log that looks like: `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use.` (See [#2](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/issues/2))

Sure, if you do not care about MySQL options, such as version, bound port, character set, character collation, root password, etc., you can use the Default MySQL instead of this Action.

### Shutdown the Default MySQL

490,"# phpunit-matcher-action

This action uses the built in PHPUnit `--teamcity` formatter to add annotations to your Github Actions builds.

![PHPUnit Action Matcher Logs Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mheap/phpunit-matcher-action/main/phpunit-matcher-logs.png)

![PHPUnit Action Matcher Context Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mheap/phpunit-matcher-action/main/phpunit-matcher-context.png)

## Usage

To configure these matchers, add the following step to your workflow YAML file before running PHPUnit with the `--teamcity` flag.

```yaml
```

Here's a complete workflow example (located at `.github/workflows/phpunit.yml`) that runs your tests and adds annotations for failures

```yaml
```

If you run your tests in a container and the Teamcity output will have a different base path, you can specify it using the `base_path` input:

```yaml
  with:
    base_path: /path/to/other/folder
```

## How this works

[Problem matchers](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/problem-matchers.md) work by defining a regular expression to extract information such as the file, line number and severity from any output logs. Each matcher has to be registered with Github Actions by adding `::add-matcher::/path/to/matcher.json` to the output.

This action generates regular expressions based on the Github workspace, writes out matcher files and then registers them with the Action runner.

It uses the Teamcity output as it contains all of the required information (file path, failure message and line number).

**NOTE:** If you are using dot/graphviz in your doxygen config to generate diagrams the only fonts installed, and hence can be used are those in the [GNU FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/) package (FreeSans, FreeMono and FreeSerif) or in any package listed in `additional-packages`.

## Versions
Previously, versions of this action incremented as changes were made to the repo. However, this has now been changed so the tagged versions of this action match the doxygen versions they relate to.
An `edge` tag has been created, tracking the version of doxygen available on the alpine `edge` tag.

### Supported Tags
| Action Version | Doxygen Version | Alpine Version | Tag Aliases |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| edge           | 1.9.6-r0        | edge           |             |
| 1.9.5          | 1.9.5-r0        | 3.17           | v1, v1.9    |
| 1.9.4          | 1.9.4-r0        | 3.16           |             |
| 1.9.2          | 1.9.2-r1        | 3.15           |             |
| 1.9.1          | 1.9.1-r1        | 3.14           |             |
| 1.8.18         | 1.8.18-r0       | 3.12           | v1.8        |

## Inputs

### 'working-directory'

**Optional** Path of the working directory to change to before running doxygen. Default: `.`

### 'doxyfile-path'

**Optional** Path of the Doxyfile relative to the working directory. Default: `./Doxyfile`.

Enable Docker Layer Caching by adding a single line in GitHub Actions.
This GitHub Action speeds up the building of docker images in your GitHub Actions workflow.

You can run `docker build` and `docker-compose build` in your GitHub Actions workflow using the cache with no special configuration, and it also supports multi-stage builds.

This GitHub Action uses the [docker save](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/) / [docker load](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/) command and the [@actions/cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache) library.

## \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f **Deprecation Notice for `v0.0.4` and older** \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f

The author had not considered a large number of layers to be cached, so those versions process all layers in parallel.
([#12](https://github.com/satackey/action-docker-layer-caching/issues/12))  
**Please update to version `v0.0.5` with limited concurrency to avoid overloading the cache service.**

## Example workflows

### Docker Compose
```yaml
```


### docker build

```yaml
```


## Inputs

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for details.

By default, the cache is separated by the workflow name.
You can also set the cache key manually, like the official [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache#usage) action.

```yaml
```

**Note: You must include `{hash}` in the `key` input.** (`{hash}` is replaced by the hash value of the docker image when the action is executed.)

This Action for [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/) enables arbitrary actions with the `gem` command-line client, including publishing to a registry.

## Usage

An example workflow to build and publish a gem to the default public registry follows:

```hcl
```

### Secrets

* `RUBYGEMS_AUTH_TOKEN` - **Optional**. The token to use for authentication with the rubygems repository. Required for `gem push`.

### Environment variables

* `RUBYGEMS_HOST` - **Optional**. To specify a repository to authenticate with. Defaults to `https://rubygems.org` [more info](https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment). 

#### Example

To authenticate with, and publish to, a registry other than `https://rubygems.org`:

```hcl
```

# Action Litmus-Parallel

This action was designed to allow running acceptance tests for Puppet modules using Litmus. 
This will allow you to set up a matrix strategy in your Github Actions workflow to run the module's acceptance tests on multiple platforms and Puppet agent versions.

## Getting Started

In the following example you can see the jobs setup in a Github Actions workflow that runs the acceptance tests using Litmus for a module using Puppet agent versions 5 and 6 and platform array specified in the provision.yaml of the module, in this example the platforms specified in the release_checks are used. For more information about the provision.yaml and Litmus see the documentation [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/wiki).

# Docker build-with-cache action

This action builds your docker image and caches the stages (supports multi-stage builds) to improve building times in subsequent builds.

By default, it pushes the image with all the stages to a registry (needs username and password), but you can disable this feature by setting `push_image_and_stages` to `false`.

Built-in support for the most known registries:

- Docker Hub
- AWS ECR (private and public)
- GitHub\'s (old and new registry)
- Google Cloud\'s

## Inputs

### Required

- **image_name**: Image name (e.g. *node*).

or

- **compose_file**: path to Docker Compose file. You will need to configure this action multiple times if you have a compose file which uses more than one registry.

> :star2: New in v5.10.0: Now you can use [overrides](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) for your compose file(s) like this:  
  `docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.override.yml > docker-compose.override2.yml`

### Optional

- **image_tag**: Tag(s) of the image. Allows multiple comma-separated tags (e.g. `one,another`) (default: `latest`).  
  If you set **compose_file** and the image(s) already has/have a tag, this is ignored.

- **registry**: Docker registry (default: *Docker Hub\'s registry*). You need a registry to use the cache functionality.

- **username**: Docker registry\'s user (needed to push images, or to pull from a private repository).

- **password**: Docker registry\'s password (needed to push images, or to pull from a private repository).

- **session**: Extra auth parameters. For AWS ECR, means setting AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variable.

- **push_git_tag**: In addition to `image_tag`, you can also push the git tag in your [branch tip][branch tip] (default: `false`).

- **pull_image_and_stages**: Set to `false` to avoid pulling from the registry or to build from scratch (default: `true`).

- **stages_image_name**: Set custom name for stages. Useful if using a job matrix (default: `$image_name-stages)`.

- **build_extra_args**: Extra params for `docker build` (e.g. `""--build-arg=hello=world""`).  
  > :star2: New in v5.11.0: If you need extra args with newlines or spaces, use json format like this:  
    `build_extra_args: \'{""--build-arg"": ""myarg=Hello\
World""}\'`

  > :star2: If you need multiple args with same key, use an array as the value of the key like this:  
    `build_extra_args: \'{""--build-arg"": [""foo=bar"", ""one=two""]}\'`

- **push_image_and_stages**: Test a command before pushing. Use `false` to not push at all (default: `true`).

    This input also supports 2 special values, which are useful if your workflow can be triggered by different events:

    - `on:push`: Push only if the workflow was triggered by a push.
    - `on:pull_request`: Push only if the workflow was triggered by a pull_request.

- **services_regex**: Regex to filter services from compose file. Only valid when **compose_file** was provided. Default is `.+` (all services).

[branch tip]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16080342/what-is-a-branch-tip-in-git

#### Ignored if `compose_file` is set

- **image_name**

- **context**: Docker context (default: `./`).

- **dockerfile**: Dockerfile filename path (default: `""$context""/Dockerfile`).

## Outputs

- **FULL_IMAGE_NAME**: Full name of the Docker Image with the Registry (if provided) and Namespace included.  
e.g.: `docker.pkg.github.com/whoan/hello-world/hello-world`

## How it works

The action does the following every time it is triggered:

- (Optional) Pull previously pushed [stages](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) (if any) from the specified `registry` (default: https://hub.docker.com)
- Build the image using cache (i.e. the pulled stages)
- Tag the image
- (Optional) Push the image with the tag(s) specified in `image_tag`
- (Optional) Push each stage to the registry with names like `<image_name>-stages:<1,2,3,...>`
- (Optional) Push the git tag as `<image_name>:<git_tag>` if you set `push_git_tag: true`

## Examples

Find working minimal examples for the most known registries in [this repo](https://github.com/whoan/hello-world/tree/master/.github/workflows).

### Docker Hub

> If you don\'t specify a registry, Docker Hub is the default one

```yml
```

### GitHub Registry

> [GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret). If you are going to use the new GitHub Registry (ghcr.io), be sure to use a Personal Access Token (as the password) with ""write:packages"" and ""read:packages"" scopes. More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#migrating-a-docker-image-using-the-docker-cli).

> If you push the image to a **public** repository\'s GitHub Registry, please be aware that it will be impossible to delete it because of GitHub\'s policy (see [Deleting a package](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/deleting-a-package)).

```yml
```

### Google Cloud Registry

> More info [here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key) on how to get GCloud JSON key.

```yml
```

### AWS ECR

> You don\'t even need to create the repositories in advance, as this action takes care of that for you! (you\'ll need the `CreateRepository` permission)

```yml
```

### From a compose file

> The compose file is parsed and the action will run once for each detected image. The registry is also detected from the image name, and if none is provided, DockerHub is assumed.

```yml
```

```yml
```

With a compose file override:

```yml
```

Filtering services by regex:

```yml
    services_regex: \'(service_1|extra_service.*)\' # eg: builds services called exactly ""service_1"" plus the ones which start with ""extra_service"" and may have extra chars after
```

### Example with more options

```yml
```

## Cache is not working?

- Be specific with the base images. e.g.: if you start from an image with the `latest` tag, it may download different versions when the action is triggered, and it will invalidate the cache.
- If you are using Buildkit, the stages won\'t be pushed to the registry. This might be supported in a future version.
- Some docker limitations might cause the cache not to be used correctly. More information [in this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54574821/docker-build-not-using-cache-when-copying-gemfile-while-using-cache-from/56024061#56024061).

## Tests

The tests for this action are run in a [separate repo](https://github.com/whoan/hello-world) as I need to set credentials for each registry with GitHub secrets and doing so in this repo is not practical.

Use `registry` for pushing to a custom registry.
> NOTE: GitHub\'s Docker registry uses a different path format to Docker Hub, as shown below. See [Configuring Docker for use with GitHub Package Registry](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-package-registry/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-package-registry#publishing-a-package) for more information.
If you\'re using GitHub Packages, you might also want to use `${{ github.actor }}` as the `username`.

```yaml
```

### snapshot
Use `snapshot` to push an additional image, which is tagged with  
`{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}{HOUR}{MINUTE}{SECOND}{first 6 digits of the git sha}`.  
The date was inserted to prevent new builds with external dependencies override older builds with the same sha.
When you would like to think about versioning images, this might be useful.  

```yaml
```

### dockerfile
Use `dockerfile` when you would like to explicitly build a Dockerfile.  
This might be useful when you have multiple DockerImages.  

```yaml
```

### workdir
Use `workdir` when you would like to change the directory for building.

```yaml
```

### context
Use `context` when you would like to change the Docker build context.

```yaml
```

### buildargs
Use `buildargs` when you want to pass a list of environment variables as [build-args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg). Identifiers are separated by comma.   
All `buildargs` will be masked, so that they don\'t appear in the logs.  

```yaml
```

### buildoptions
Use `buildoptions` when you want to configure [options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for building.  

```yaml
```

### cache
Use `cache` when you have big images, that you would only like to build partially (changed layers).  
> CAUTION: Docker builds will cache non-repoducable commands, such as installing packages. If you use this option, your packages will never update. To avoid this, run this action on a schedule with caching **disabled** to rebuild the cache periodically.

```yaml
```

### tag_names
Use `tag_names` when you want to push tags/release by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/MY_TAG_NAME`).  
> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.

```yaml
```

498,"# GitHub Action - Get a Releases
This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Get a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to get releases.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The release ID
- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`
- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action

### Example workflow - get a release
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):

```yaml
```

## quick start

Insert the following into the appropriate step in your `.github/workflows/*.yml` file:

    - name: Update release
      uses: johnwbyrd/update-release@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        files: ./one-file-you-want-to-release.zip dist/another-file-to-release.exe README.md

### quick start for builds lasting more than an hour

The `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is valid for exactly an hour from the time your build starts.  If your build requires longer than an hour to run, you will need to [create your own access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with repo admin access, [store it as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) in your own repository, and reference that secret token in your build:

    - name: Update release
      uses: johnwbyrd/update-release@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_PRIVATE_SECRET_TOKEN }}
        asset: ./the-file-you-want-to-release.zip

## summary

[This Github action](https://www.github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release) allows you, and anyone you choose, to easily get access to files created as part of your continuous integration on [Github runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

If you use Github to build digital assets such as zip files or executables, this action makes accessing your build products easy for everyone involved with your project.

Github has a very walled-garden, hands-on philosophy about what a ""release"" should be.  According to Github, a release *must* be tagged by a human; release artifacts *must* be built by a human; and then specific binary assets *must be* uploaded by a human into that release.

This update-release action *breaks down* those expectations.  Any branch, tag, or indeed *any Github checkin at all*, can now be continuously integrated via Github runners, with its build products continuously accessible to you, your team, or the world, via Github releases.

With this action, Github runners can build, test, and package artifacts on *any* Github ref, branch, or tag.  This action continuously creates and updates the necessary Github tags and releases with these artifacts.

This update-release action makes sane choices all the way along this process, but it lets you override those choices easily. Every time a Github runner builds your source code, update-release creates or updates a [Github release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases) for your assets, and then uploads the freshly built assets into your release.  Existing releases are reused, and existing assets with the same names are replaced.

Because this action is written in [TypeScript](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and executes in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), it runs on *all* Github\'s supported build runner platforms. These include Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu as of this writing.

## why another build publisher?

Because no existing Github action implements *all* of what is needed to do continuous releasing on Github.

Github\'s new [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) system permits a user to perform a build on Windows, MacOS, or Ubuntu.  Classically, the result of a build is usually a zip file or some other distribution file that developers would like to download and distribute.  

But getting a file result out of any Github action build process is harder than it ought to be.  Sure, you could upload the file to your own server at build completion, but then you\'d be ignoring Github\'s own file distribution and release architecture.

You\'ll have to check for the existence of any release before you create it, and you\'ll have to check for the existence of any asset already in a release with the same name, and delete it, before you upload the newly built asset.

Or, you could just use this Github action, update-release, which does all that in one step.  As of this writing, no other continuous integration plugin makes sane choices for all these steps.

## guide

Once your build has successfully completed, update-release will choose a friendly release name for your build.  Regardless of whether the ref that triggered the build is a tag or a branch, you\'ll get a human-friendly release name.  You can of course override the default choice. If the Github release name already exists, it is reused; otherwise, it is created.

## inputs

The following parameters are accepted as inputs to the update-release action.

### token

This should be [your secure Github token](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token). Use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` as the parameter if your build lasts less than an hour.

If your build lasts more than an hour, you will need to [create your own access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with repo admin access, [store it as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) in your own repository, and reference that secret token in your build.

This parameter is required.

### files

This should be the paths to files that you wish to add to the release.  Presumbly, this should include at least the file(s) you just built.  File paths can be provided as absolute paths, or they can alternately be relative to `${{ github.workspace }}`.  

This parameter is required.

### release
    
The name of the release to be created. A reasonable-looking release name will be created from the current `${{ github.ref }}` if this input is not supplied. This reasonable looking default is created by taking `${{ github.ref }}`, removing the prefixes `refs/`, `heads/`, and `tags/` , and then replacing any remaining forward-slash symbols `/` with dashes `-`.

If you don\'t like this behavior, just override the release name here yourself.

This parameter is not required.

### tag

The name of the tag to be created. For some inexplicable reason, Github thinks that you need to have a tag corresponding to every release, which makes no sense if you\'re using Github to do continuous integration builds.  The tag will be the same as the calculated name of the release, if this input is not supplied. 

This parameter is not required.

### message

A brief description of the tag and also of the release. This parameter is not required.

### body

A longer decsription of the release, if it is created. This parameter is not required.

### prerelease

Should the release, if created, be marked as a prerelease?  Such releases are generally publicly visible.  Provide true or false as a parameter.

The default setting is `true`.

### draft

Should the release, if created, be marked as a draft?  Such releases are generally not publicly visible.  Provide true or false as a parameter.

The default setting is `false`.
    
## outputs

If assets are successfully published, you will get the following outputs from the step, which you can use in later processing.

The following parameters are provided as outputs to this Github action.

### files

The calculated local paths of the files to be uploaded into the release.

### draft

Whether the release, if created, was marked as a draft.

### prerelease

Whether the release, if created, was marked as a prerelease.

### release

The name of the release.

### tag

The tag used to create the release.

## internals

This Github action was written for [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release), and it uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in order to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) before bundling.  Use [npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) to install all package.json dependencies of update-release, before hacking on it.

Development is done in Visual Studio Code.  It\'s necessary to manually build a target before debugging it.  The `test` target is for debugging; `test-watch` watches for and recompiles any changes for debugging; `bundle` minifies the current `src/main.ts` into `dist/main.js` for release.

Several [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) targets were added to speed along development.  The `test` run target builds readable `dist/main.js` and `dist/main.map.js` files, for source-level debugging of the TypeScript.  A `test-watch` run target watches the `src/main.ts` file for changes, and lints and recompiles it as needed.  And, a `bundle` run target prepares a production minified `dist/main.js`.

This action uses the `dotenv` import in order to facilitate debugging.  This import reads a `.env` file, if it exists, as the root of the installation, and uses it to populate environmental variables for local testing of update-release.  A typical .env file for developing update-release, might look something like this:

    INPUT_ASSET=your-build-asset.zip
    INPUT_TOKEN=00000000000000000000000000000001
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY=you/your-repo
    GITHUB_REF=refs/heads/master
    GITHUB_WORKSPACE=/absolute/local/path/to/workspace

Using an `.env` file, you can perform local testing and debugging of update-release without having to build a product first.

### security concerns

You *should* review the source code of this -- and *all other!* -- Github actions, to verify that they don\'t store, transmit, or otherwise mistreat your secure Github token.

When you provide your secure access token to any Github action, you\'re essentially giving the code in that action permission to do whatever it wants to your repository.  *Don\'t* just hand over your security tokens to any Github actions, for which the sources are not available!

For extra peace of mind, please review src/main.ts *in detail*; also, feel free to rebuild main.js using `npm run bundle`, to make sure that the minified main.js corresponds exactly to main.ts.

As an extra protection, src/main.ts tries to helpfully mark the token that you provide it as a secret, so that it doesn\'t inadvertently sneak into any log files.

## problems?

I welcome all reasonable patches and improvements as merge requests against [this repository](https://github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release).

500,"# github action maven release

The GitHub Action for Maven releases wraps the Maven CLI to enable Maven release.
For example, you can use this action for auto-incrementing your project version and release your java artifacts.

This github action is bot friendly: You can configure the credentials of a bot user, which would be used during the incremental commit.
The commits by the bot can also be signed, giving you the guaranty that only the bot can release in your repo. Additionally,
this give you a clean git history by highlighting nicely which commits where resulting from your CI.

## Supporting this github action

Support this github action by staring this project. Surprisingly, it seems to be the only way for the github market place to highlight popular github actions.

## Sample repository

We created a sample repository that will show you an example of how this github action can be used for releasing a Java application: 
https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release-sample

## Features

Obviously, this github actions uses maven release plugin. Although, we did add on top a few features that you may like.

Maven release uses Git behind it, therefore there were a few features related in customising the git configuration:
- Signing the commits (GPG) resulting from the maven release [[GPG](#setup-a-gpg-key)]
- Authenticating to private repository using an SSH key [[SSH](#setup-with-ssh)]
- Configuring the git username and email [[Bot](#customise-the-bot-name)]
- Configuring the jdk version [[JDK](#jdk-version)]

You may want to configure a bit maven too. We added the following features:
- Specify the maven project path. In other words, if your maven project is not at the root of your repo, you can configure a sub path. [[Custom project path](#customise-the-m2-folder-path)] 
- Configure private maven server repositories [[Private maven repo](#Setup-private-maven-server-repositories)]
- Configure a docker registry [[Docker registry](#setup-a-docker-registry)]
- Setup custom maven arguments and/or options to be used when calling maven commands [[Maven options](#maven-options)]
- Configure a custom M2 folder [[Custom M2](#customise-the-m2-folder-path)]
- Print the timestamp for every maven logs. Handy for troubleshooting performance issues in your CI. [[Log timestamp](#log-timestamp)]

For the maven releases, we got also some dedicated functionalities:
- Skip the maven perform [[Skip perform](#skipping-perform)]
- Roll back the maven perform if it failed to perform the release
- Increment the major or minor version (by default, it\'s the patch version that is increased) [[Major Minor version](#increase-major-or-minor-version)]
- customise the version format completly [[Customize version](#customize-version)]

# Usage

## Setup your pom.xml for maven release

Before you even begin setting up this github action, you would need to set up your pom.xml first to be ready for maven releases.
We recommend you to refer to the maven release plugin documentation for more details: https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/

Nevertheless, we will give you some essential setups

### Configure the SCM

You got two choices here:
- Using SSH URL (Recommended)
```xml
```
- Using HTTPS URL
```xml
```

In the case of SSH, it will use the `ssh-private-key`  to authenticate with the upstream.
In the case of HTTPS, maven releases will use the `access-token` in this github actions to authenticate with the upstream.

Note: SSH is more elegant and usually the easiest one to setup due to the large amount of documents online on this subject.

### maven release plugin

Add the maven release plugin dependency to your project

```xml
```

Personally, I usually the prefix `[ci skip]` which allows me to skip more easily any commits generated by the bot from the CI.

## Setup the maven release github actions

### Choose your version of this github action

If it\'s your first time using a github action, I invite you having a quick read to the github official recommendations:
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions

It\'s important you understand how the versioning work and the risk/compromise of using master/tags/commit hash

If you are adventurous and like to be always on top of this github action, you can use the reference *master* :

```
```

If you are more reserve, you can use a tag instead. You can find the list of the tags for this github action here:

https://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release/tags

To use a tag:

```
```

If you are concerned about the security of this github action, you can also move to a commit hash:

```
```



### Basic setup
For a simple repo with not much protection and private dependency, you can do:

```yaml
```

You will need to follow the `Setup with SSH` section to setup the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` accordingly.

### Setup with SSH

Although you may found better to use a SSH key instead. For this, generate an SSH key with the method of your choice, or use an existing one.
Personally, I like generating an SSH inside a temporary docker image and configure it as a deploy key in my repository:

```bash
```

```bash
```

Copy `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and add it as a new secret.
![img/Add-ssh-secrets.png](img/Add-ssh-secrets.png?raw=true)

Copy `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` and add it as a new deployment key with write access.
![img/add-deploy-key.png](img/add-deploy-key.png?raw=true)

Finally, setup the github action with:

```yaml
```

If you want to set up a passphrase for your key:

```yaml
          ssh-passphrase: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSPHRASE }}
```

#### SSH known hosts

The current github actions support by default the following known hosts:

- `github.com`
- `gitlab.com`
- `bitbucket.org`

Although you may want to additional one, using the following properties:

```yaml
```

You can also disable the default hosts (for example, if you are behind a corporate proxy) like so:
```yaml
```

### log Timestamp

It can be quite difficult to troubleshoot any performance issue on your CI, due to the lack of timestamp from maven by default.
An example of it particular handy, is when you private maven repository is having performance issue that is affecting your CI.

We added the timestamp by default, you don\'t need to do anything particular to enable this feature.

The logs should look like:

```
``` 
 
### Maven options

#### Adding maven arguments

You can add some maven arguments, which is handy for skipping tests:

```yaml
```

#### Adding maven options

You can add some maven options. At the difference of the maven arguments, those one are explicitly for the maven release plugin.
See https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/prepare-mojo.html.

```yaml
```

### JDK version

The default JDK version is JDK 17. Although you may want to compile your project with a specific JDK version. You will need to specify the JAVA_HOME variable with the according value.
If you need a specific jdk version that is not in the list, please raise an issue in this github action to request it.

#### JDK 8

```yaml
```

#### JDK 11

```yaml
```

#### JDK 14

```yaml
```

#### JDK 15

```yaml
```

#### JDK 16

```yaml
```


#### JDK 17

```yaml
```


### Customise the bot name

You can simply customise the bot name as follows:


```yaml
```

### Customise the default branch
You may not want to release from your master branch, which is currently the default branch setup by this github action. You can customise the branch name you want to release on, here `release`, as follows:

```yaml
```

### Skipping perform
If for a reason, you need to skip the maven release perfom, you can disable it as follow:

```yaml
```


### Increase major, minor or patch version

#### For major version increment

_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT_

```yaml
```

#### For minor version increment

_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT_

```yaml
```

#### For patch version increment

As the patch version is the default version number increased, you don\'t need to specify any additional properties.

Although if you prefer to be explicit, you can use the following option:

_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT_

```yaml
```

### Customize version

#### development version

You may want to fully customize the development version number. This option will allow you to fully take control on the version number format.

For Example, you could decide to only have a 2 part version number like `0.2-SNAPSHOT`.

```yaml
```

### Release version

You may want to fully customize the release version number. This option will allow you to fully take control on the version number format.

For Example, you could decide to only have a trailing 0 for releases like `0.2.0`.

```yaml
```


#### Customise the M2 folder path

It\'s quite common for setting up a caching of your dependencies, that you will be interested to customise the .m2 localisation folder.

```yaml
```


### Setup a GPG key
If you want to set up a GPG key, you can do it by injecting your key via the secrets:

Note: `GITHUB_GPG_KEY` needs to be base64 encoded.
if you haven\'t setup a GPG key yet, see next section.

```yaml
```

In case you want to skip the GPG step, you can set `gpg-enabled: ""false""` or if you prefer to have the same behaviour in your IDE, add this maven plugin in your `pom.xml` to skip GPG step in the release phase:

```xml
```

### Setup private maven server repositories

If you got a private maven repo to set up in the settings.xml, you can do:
Note: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.

```yaml
```

Github actions currently don\'t support arrays input format.
This is why we choose to request the secret `MVN_REPO_SERVERS` to be a JSON containing the servers definition. Example:

```json
```

You will need to put the JSON in one line:
```bash
```

### Setup a docker registry

If you got a private maven repo to set up in the settings.xml, you can do:
Note: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.

```yaml
```

Note: For docker hub, this would look like:
```yaml
```

### Configure your maven project

You may also be in the case where you got more than one maven projects inside the repo. We added an option that will make the release job move to the according directly before running the release:

```yaml
```


## Setup the bot gpg key

Setting up a gpg key for your bot is a good security feature. This way, you can enforce sign commits in your repo,
even for your release bot.

![Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9F6cxpqm/Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png)

- Create dedicate github account for your bot and add him into your team for your git repo.
- Create a new GPG key: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key

This github action needs the key ID and the key base64 encoded.

```yaml
```

If you want to set up a passphrase:

```yaml
            gpg-passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }} 
```

### Generate the key

f you like how we created a SSH key pair, here is the same idea using a docker image to generate a GPG key:

```bash
```

```bash
```

Note: Don\'t exit the docker container as we are not done yet.


### Get the KID

You can get the key ID doing the following:

```bash
```
The key ID for my bot is 3EFC3104C0088B08. Add this value into your github secret for this repo, under `GPG_KEY_ID`
PS: the key id is not really a secret but we found more elegant to store it there than in plain text in the github action yml

### Get the GPG public and private key

Now we need the raw key and base64 encode
```bash
```

Copy the public key and import it to the bot account as a GPG key.
Copy the private key and add it in your github repo secrets under `GPG_KEY`.

This action sets up Maven environments for use in GitHub Actions by:
 - create maven settings.xml
 - set ```interactiveMode``` to false - useful in CI system
 - after job finish generated settings.xml will be removed to prevent cache or left sensitive data on build system
 - add server to servers with id=github, username=$GITHUB_ACTOR and password=$GITHUB_TOKEN

# Project versioning
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
We recommended to use the latest and specific release version.

In order to keep your project dependencies up to date you can watch this repository *(Releases only)*
or use automatic tools like [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot-version-updates).


 # Usage

 You can try our action [Setup Maven Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-maven-action) for completely maven environment setup.

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## default ```settings.xml```
```yml
```

## ```settings.xml``` with servers section

```yml
  with:
    servers: \'[{""id"": ""serverId"", ""username"": ""username"", ""password"": ""password""}]\'
```

Also you can use `path` argument if your settings.xml is stored in different location.


All `server` attributes may be specified:
  * `id` _(required)_
  * `username`
  * `password`
  * `privateKey`
  * `passphrase`
  * `filePermissions`
  * `directoryPermissions`
  * `configuration`

Please refer to the [servers](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers) documentation for more information.

## ```settings.xml``` with servers section and additional configuration

``` yml
  with:
    servers: |
      [{
        ""id"": ""serverId"",
        ""configuration"": {
          ""item1"": ""value1"",
          ""item2"": {
            ""item21"": ""value21"",
            ""item22"": ""value22""
          }
        }
      }]
```

result will be:

```xml
```


## ```settings.xml``` with mirrors section
```yml
  with:
    mirrors: \'[{""id"": ""mirrorId"", ""name"": ""mirrorName"", ""mirrorOf"": ""mirrorOf"", ""url"": ""mirrorUrl""}]\'
```

## ```settings.xml``` with proxies section
```yml
```

## ```settings.xml``` with properties
```yml
  with:
    properties: \'[{""propertyName1"": ""propertyValue1""}, {""propertyName2"": ""propertyValue2""}]\'
```

## ```settings.xml``` with https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots in repository list

```yml
  with:
    sonatypeSnapshots: true
```

## ```settings.xml``` with https://repository.apache.org/snapshots/ in repository list

```yml
  with:
    apacheSnapshots: true
```

## Do not override existing ```settings.xml```, from version **2.0** file is override by default :
```yml
  with:
    override: false
```

## Do not add github to server in ```settings.xml```, by default is added:
```yml
  with:
    githubServer: false
```

## ```settings.xml``` with special server item configuration for oracle repository [Oracle Maven Repository](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/core/MAVEN/config_maven_repo.htm#MAVEN9015)

```yml
  with:
    oracleServers: \'[{""id"": ""serverId"", ""username"": ""username"", ""password"": ""password""}]\'
```

## ```settings.xml``` with [Oracle Maven Repository](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/core/MAVEN/config_maven_repo.htm#MAVEN9017)
```yml
  with:
    oracleRepo: true
```

## GitHub actions secrets

It is also possible pass in Github Secrets e.g.

``` yml
  with:
    servers: |
      [{
          ""id"": ""sonatype-nexus-snapshots"",
          ""username"": ""${{ secrets.SONATYPE_USERNAME }}"",
          ""password"": ""${{ secrets.SONATYPE_PASSWORD }}""
      }]
```

**Note**: secrets are *not* passed in if the workflow is triggered from a forked repository. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) for further information. This can be avoided by using `if` triggers on the job e.g. `if: github.event_name == \'push\'`.

# Notes

**maven-settings-action** should be put at the latest position before maven run in order to avoid override ```setting.xml``` by another action

```yml
```

GitHub Action that gets the latest tag from Git

![Example output showing this action in action](images/output.png)

## Input

By default, this action will fail if no tag can be found, however, it accepts a `fallback` tag that will be used when no 
tag can be found. Keep in mind that when this action is used in a workflow that has no `.git` directory, it will still 
fail, and the fallback tag isn\'t used.

It is also accepts a `prefix` string to query the tags based on it.

* `fallback`: `1.0.0`
* `prefix`: `tag-prefix`

## Output

This action has two outputs, `tag` for the found tag, or the fallback. And, `timestamp` as a UNIX Epoch timestmap for 
when the tag was created, or when no tag is found, and a fallback tag has be specific is provides the timestamp of 
action execution.

* `tag`: `1.2.3`
* `timestamp`: `123`

## Example

Find more examples in the [examples directory](./examples/).

The following example works together with the [`WyriHaximus/github-action-next-semvers`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/next-semvers) and [`WyriHaximus/github-action-create-milestone`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-milestone) actions.
Where it provides the previous tag from that action so it can supply a set of versions for the next action, which creates a new milestone.

504,"# GitHub Action - Releases API

![test](https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-upload-release-asset/workflows/test/badge.svg)

This GitHub Action uploads release assets using [Upload a release asset](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets?apiVersion=2022-11-28#upload-a-release-asset).
[actions/upload-release-asset] is great, but it is no longer maintained.
So, I create this action.

## FEATURE

The action is compatible with [actions/upload-release-asset],
however it has some additional features.

- You can upload multiple assets in one step by using [glob patterns](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob#patterns)
- The actions guesses the content-type from the extensions

## SYNOPSIS

### Upload assets when a release has been created

You can upload assets when [a release has been created](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release).

```yaml
```

### Upload assets when a tag has been created

If you want to create a release in your workflow, you can use [shogo82148/actions-create-release] GitHub Action.

```yaml
```

## Inputs

### github_token

The API token for GitHub.
`${{ github.token }}` is used by default.

### upload_url

The URL for uploading assets to the release.

### asset_path

The path to the asset you want to upload.
You can use [glob patterns](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob#patterns) here.

### asset_name

The name of the asset you want to upload.
The file name of `asset_path` is used by default.

### asset_content_type

The content-type of the asset you want to upload.
See the supported Media Types here: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml for more information.

By default, the actions guesses the content-type using the [mime-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types) package.

### overwrite

If an asset with the same name already exists, overwrite it (Default: false).

[![GitHub Release][ico-release]][link-github-release]
[![License][ico-license]](LICENSE)

A Github Action for sending data to an endpoint.

Supports for triggering any webhook events.

<hr/>


## Usage

Sending data to trigger a github webhook event, it can trigger workflow of another repo too (see [douments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#external-events-repository_dispatch) for more information documents):

```yml
```

### Inputs

All inputs will pass to `curl` command, so see [curl document](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) for more information.

|  Name  |  Required  |  Default  |  Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  webhook_url  |  true  |  """"  |  Endpoint URL  | `""https://****""` |
|  data  |  true  |  """"  |  Data to be posted  | `""{\\""event_type\\"":\\""build\\""}""` |
|  options |  false  |  """"  |  Options  | `""-a foo -b bar""` |
|  user  |  false  |  """"  |  The user name and password to use for server authentication  | `""user:password""` |

With the inputs above, the action will invoke the following command finally:

`curl -X POST https://**** --user user:password --data ""{\\""event_type\\"":\\""build\\""}"" -a foo -b bar`

This action sets up a java environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a requested version of java by version and adding to PATH. Default downloads are populated from the [Zulu Community distribution of OpenJDK](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/)
- registering problem matchers for error output

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
```
Examples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:

- A major Java version

  e.g. ```6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...```

- A semver Java version specification

  e.g. ```8.0.232, 7.0.181, 11.0.4```

  e.g. ```8.0.x, >11.0.3, >=13.0.1, <8.0.212```

- An early access (EA) Java version

  e.g. ```14-ea, 15-ea```

  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea, 15.0.0-ea```

  e.g. ```14.0.0-ea.28, 15.0.0-ea.2``` (syntax for specifying an EA build number)

  Note that, per semver rules, EA builds will be matched by explicit EA version specifications.

- 1.x syntax

    e.g. ```1.8``` (same as ```8```)

    e.g. ```1.8.0.212``` (same as ```8.0.212```)

The two `settings.xml` files created from the above example look like the following.

`settings.xml` file created for the first deploy to GitHub Packages
```xml
```

`settings.xml` file created for the second deploy to Apache Maven Central
```xml
```

***NOTE: The `settings.xml` file is created in the Actions $HOME directory. If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***

If `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner\'s temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).

_Black_ is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede
control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,
determinism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time
and mental energy for more important matters.

Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you\'re reading. Formatting
becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.

_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.

Try it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the
[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.

---

**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**

---

## Installation and usage

### Installation

_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.7+ to run.
If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install ""black[jupyter]""`.

If you can\'t wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:

`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`

### Usage

To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```sh
```

You can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn\'t work:

```sh
python -m ```

Further information can be found in our docs:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many
projects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel
tests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that
we have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.
Stylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python
syntax. For more information please refer to the
[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).

Also, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the
reformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the
original (see the
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)
section for details). If you\'re feeling confident, use `--fast`.

## The _Black_ code style

_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in
place. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn\'t
take previous formatting into account (see
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)
for exceptions).

Our documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are
also documented. They\'re both worth taking a look:

- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)
- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)

Changes to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:

- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be
intended behaviour.

### Pragmatism

Early versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its
initial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and
there were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,
_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.

- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document
above. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.

## Configuration

_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options
from a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom
`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your
project.

You can find more details in our documentation:

- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)

And if you\'re looking for more general configuration documentation:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

**Pro-tip**: If you\'re asking yourself ""Do I need to configure anything?"" the answer is
""No"". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your
code in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.

## Used by

The following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent
code style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,
SQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),
pandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,
Zulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.

The following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,
Quora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.

## Overview

`setup-ros` sets up an environment so that:

- [ROS 2 latest development branch][ros2_latest_development_setup] builds from source,
- non-EOL (End Of Life) distribution of ROS 2 builds from source,
- any ROS, and ROS 2 package depending on non-EOL distribution builds from source

The action will not install ROS, or ROS 2, by default.
To install a ROS binary distribution, pass a value to `required-ros-distributions` (see example below).

:warning: `apt-get update` is flaky on bare metal GitHub actions Linux workers relying on the GitHub APT mirrors.
It is recommended to run `setup-ros` in a Docker container.
See [`jobs.<job_id>.container` documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer).
An alternative approach is to edit APT sources on the bare metal worker (see [#80](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros/issues/80) for details).

## Supported platforms

This GitHub action aims for strict [REP-3] and [REP-2000] compliance.
`setup-ros` supports all non-EOL ROS distributions, on all Tier-1 platforms.
In particular, this action supports Ubuntu, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.

For macOS, and Microsoft Windows, the OS version specified in the REPs may not be available as a [GitHub Hosted runners][github_hosted_runners].
In this case, this GitHub action CI runs the closest available worker environment.

Users requiring exact REP compliance should run the action on a [self-hosted runner][self_hosted_runner].

This problem does not apply to Linux workers, where Docker can ensure that the action runs the Linux distribution specified by the REPs.

## Tasks performed by the action

`setup-ros` installs the following command-line tools:

- `colcon`
- `rosdep`
- `vcs`

It also performs the following actions:

- On Ubuntu:
  - Setting the locale to `en_US.UTF-8` and, the timezone to UTC
  - GCC and clang default APT packages
  - Registering the Open Robotics APT repository
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using APT
- On macOS:
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Homebrew] and [pip]
- On Microsoft Windows:
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Chocolatey]

The dependencies installed by this package include ROS 2 DDS vendor packages, such as Eclipse Cyclone DDS, eProsima Fast DDS, and RTI Connext DDS.
See [`src/package_manager/*.ts`](./src/package_manager/) for the complete list.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

`setup-ros` is under active development, and compatibility between releases is not yet guaranteed.
Please do not use `ros-tooling/setup-ros@master`.
Instead, pin your workflows to a particular release, e.g.: `ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7`.

### Setting up the worker, and installing the system dependencies

The default behavior is to only install development tools.
No ROS binary distribution is installed in this case.
This setup should be used when ROS is built entirely from source.

```yaml
```

### Setting up the worker, and installing system dependencies on all OSes

It is possible to iterate on macOS and Windows from the same job (`build`).
Ubuntu requires its own separate workflow as additional configuration is required for Docker.

```yaml
```

### Setting up the worker, installing system dependencies and ROS (Linux)

One or more ROS distributions can be installed simultaneously by passing multiple values to `required-ros-distributions`.
This setup is necessary to use the ROS 1/ROS 2 bridge: [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge).

```yaml
```

**Note: on Ubuntu, `required-ros-distributions` installs the desktop variant for that distribution. This option is not required, and should probably be avoided in most workflows. It is retained for historical reasons and those who specifically do not care about whether their application specifies its dependencies properly.**

### Use pre-release ROS 2 binaries for testing

You can specify if you\'d like to use the [pre-release ROS 2 repository][pre_release_testing] in your sources list file by setting the `use-ros2-testing` parameter to `true`.

```yaml
```

### Including RTI Connext

By default this action will not install RTI Connext as it requires acceptance of a non-commerical license.
The license agreement should be reviewed by users on their own before accepting it.
To include RTI Connext, simply set the `install-connext` parameter to `true`.

```yaml
```

### Iterating on all ROS distributions, for all platforms

This workflow illustrates how to spawn one job per ROS release, for every supported platform.

The workflow `test` is iterating on all ROS 2 distributions, on macOS, and Windows.

The workflow `test_docker` is iterating on all ROS and ROS 2 distributions, for all supported Ubuntu distributions, using Docker.
The test matrix associates each distribution with one Docker image.
This is required to ensure that the appropriate Ubuntu container is used.
For example, Noetic requires `focal`, Humble requires `jammy`, etc.

```yaml
```

## Alternative to `setup-ros`

On Linux workers, an alternative to `setup-ros` is to run actions on a Docker container where ROS is pre-installed.
See [Open Robotics DockerHub page][dockerhub_osrf], for instance.

## Developing

For developing and releasing `setup-ros`, see [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md).

## Requirements

This action requires the following ROS development tools to be installed (and initialized if applicable) on the CI worker instance:

```
```

On Linux, the setup can be done through [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros), or by running the action in a Docker image containing the appropriate binaries.

**Note**: for Windows, `action-ros-ci` currently needs to be run on `windows-2019` or needs another action to install Visual Studio 2019.

## Overview

The action first assembles a workspace, then runs `colcon build`, and `colcon test` in it.

The workspace is built by running:

- `vcs import` on the repo file(s) specified through the `vcs-repo-file-url` argument, if any (defaults to none)
- checkout the code under test in the workspace using `vcs`
- `rosdep install` for the workspace, to get its dependencies
- run `colcon build` (optionally limited to packages specified in `package-name`)
- run `colcon test` (optionally limited to packages specified in `package-name`; optionally [skipped](#Skip-tests))

This action requires targeting a ROS or ROS 2 distribution explicitly.
This is provided via the `target-ros1-distro` or `target-ros2-distro` inputs, respectively.
Either or both may be specified, if neither is provided an error will be raised.
This input is used to `source setup.sh` for any installed ROS binaries (e.g. installed using [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros)), as well as used as an argument to `rosdep install`.

## Action Output

This action defines [an output variable](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs): `ros-workspace-directory-name`.
It contains the path to the root of the ROS workspace assembled by the action.

The variable value should be used to retrieve logs, binaries, etc. after the action completes.

## Usage

See [`action.yml`](action.yml) to get the list of inputs supported by this action.

[action-ros-ci-template](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci-template) offers a template for using `action-ros-ci`.

In this case, `action-ros-ci` will rely on `setup-ros` for installing ROS 2 binaries.

```yaml
```

#### Building ROS 2 dependencies from source

In this case, `action-ros-ci` will build all necessary ROS 2 dependencies of `my_package` from source.

```yaml
```

### Schedule an action on a specific branch

If you want to continue supporting older ROS releases while developing on an the main branch use `acton-ros-ci` with `ref` on a scheduled job.
Without setting ref the default branch and most recent commit will be used.

```yaml
```

### Build with a custom `repos` or `rosinstall` file

You can specify your own repos file using the `vcs-repo-file-url` input.
You can also automatically generate your package\'s dependencies using the following workflow:

```yaml
```

Note that the `actions/checkout` step is required when using a custom repos file from your repository.

### Build a ROS 1 workspace

Building a ROS 1 workspace works the same way.
Simply use `target-ros1-distro` instead of `target-ros2-distro`.

```yaml
```

### Skip tests

To skip tests and code coverage data processing, set the `skip-tests` option to `true`.

```yaml
      skip-tests: true
```

### Use a `colcon` `defaults.yaml` file

To use a [`colcon` `defaults.yaml` file](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html#defaults-yaml), provide a valid JSON string through the `colcon-defaults` input.
This allows using a `colcon` option/argument that is not exposed by this action\'s inputs.

```yaml
      colcon-defaults: |
        {
          ""build"": {
            ""cmake-args"": [
                ""-DMY_CUSTOM_OPTION=ON""
            ]
          }
        }
```

### Enable Address Sanitizer to automatically report memory issues

[ASan][addresssanitizer] is an open-source tool developed to automatically report
memory corruption bugs.

```yaml
```

To look for detected memory errors, check the build logs for entries containing `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`. Example:

```
```

ASan is analyzing memory issues at runtime. ASan diagnostic messages will be emitted by the package tests when they run.

### Generate and process code coverage data

#### Generate code coverage information using `lcov` and `colcon-lcov-result`

Generate code coverage information for C/C++ files using the appropriate mixins for `gcc`.
`action-ros-ci` uses [`colcon-lcov-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-lcov-result) to aggregate generated coverage information.

Flags can be passed manually using, for instance, `extra-cmake-args`, but it is
preferable to use a `colcon` mixin (through [`colcon-defaults`](#Use-a-colcon-defaultsyaml-file)) to pass the appropriate flags automatically.

```yaml
      colcon-defaults: |
        {
          ""build"": {
            ""mixin"": [""coverage-gcc""]
          }
        }
      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid
      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/1ddb69bedfd1f04c2f000e95452f7c24a4d6176b/index.yaml
```

#### Generate code coverage information using `coveragepy` and `colcon-coveragepy-result`

Generate code coverage information for Python files using the appropriate mixins.
`action-ros-ci` uses [`colcon-coveragepy-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-coveragepy-result) to aggregate generated coverage information.

```yaml
      colcon-defaults: |
        {
          ""build"": {
            ""mixin"": [""coverage-pytest""]
          },
          ""test"": {
            ""mixin"": [""coverage-pytest""]
          }
        }
      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid
      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/1ddb69bedfd1f04c2f000e95452f7c24a4d6176b/index.yaml
```

#### Integrate `action-ros-ci` with `codecov`

The generated code coverage information can be uploaded to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/).

For a private repo, you will need to setup a secret `CODECOV_TOKEN` in [your repository settings][creating-encrypted-secrets].
See [`codecov/codecov-action`](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) documentation for more information about how to setup the action.

```yaml
```

You will also need to add a [`codecov.yml` configuration file](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecovyml-reference) (at the root of your repo):

```yaml
```

The configuration file is required to let codecov map the workspace directory structure to the Git repository structure, and setup the links between codecov and GitHub properly.
Note here that `actions/checkout` is required because `codecov/codecov-action` needs the `codecov.yml` file.

### Store `colcon` logs as build artifacts

GitHub workflows can persist data generated in workers during the build using [artifacts](persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts). `action-ros-ci` generated colcon logs can be saved as follows:

```yaml
```

### Use with private repos

`action-ros-ci` needs a token to be able to clone private repositories.
If the only private repository your workflow needs is the one against which it runs, using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will work.
However, if your workflow also clones other private repositories (e.g., repositories included in repos files provided through `vcs-repo-file-url`), you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (PAT) with the ""repo"" scope and add it to your repo\'s [secrets][creating-encrypted-secrets].
For example, if this secret is called `REPO_TOKEN`:

```yaml
```

### Interdependent pull requests or merge requests

This action allows declaring PR dependencies by providing:
* repos file(s) to override the one(s) defined through the `vcs-repo-file-url` action input
* supplemental repos file(s) to be used along with the rest

For example, this may be useful when your PR depends on PRs/MRs/branches from other repos for it to work or be properly tested.

Include links in your PR\'s description using the following format:

```
```

This Action approves and attempts to merge Pull Requests when triggered.

By using
[branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)
rules, it can be specified what the requirements are for a PR to be merged (e.g.
require branches to be up to date, require status checks to pass).

## Usage

The Action supports three run triggers:

- `check_suite` (works only on the default branch).
- `pull_request_target` for all branches.
- `workflow_run` for all branches.

When using the Merge Me! Action, ensure security of your workflows. GitHub
Security Lab provides more
[detailed](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
overview of these risks involved in using `pull_request_target` and
`workflow_run` triggers, as well as recommendations on how to avoid these risks.

Recommended setup differs between public and private repositories, however the
Action can be used in other combinations as well.

### Public repositories

Using a `workflow_run` trigger allows to provide the Merge Me! Action with
necessary credentials, while allowing the CI to keep using `pull_request`
trigger, which is safer than `pull_request_target`.

Create a new `.github/workflows/merge-me.yaml` file:

```yaml
```

Triggering on `check_suite` is similar:

```yaml
```

### Private repositories

Private repositories are less prone attacks, as only a restricted set of
accounts has access to them. At the same time, CIs in private repositories often
require access to secrets for other purposes as well, such as installing private
dependencies. For these reasons, it is recommended to use `pull_request_target`
trigger, which allows to combine regular CI checks and the Merge Me! Action into
one workflow:

```yaml
```

## Configuration

### Enable auto-merge for a different bot

You may have another bot that also creates PRs against your repository and you
want to automatically merge those. By default, this GitHub Action assumes the
bot is [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot). You can override the bot
name by changing the value of `GITHUB_LOGIN` parameter:

```yaml
```

A common scenario is to use Dependabot Preview (consider updating instead):

```yaml
```

`GITHUB_LOGIN` option supports
[micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).

### Opting in for using GitHub preview APIs

You may opt-in for using GitHub preview APIs, which enables the action to
respect strict branch protection rules configured for the repository
(`Require status checks to pass before merging` and
`Require branches to be up to date before merging` options).

```yaml
```

### Use of configurable pull request merge method

By default, this GitHub Action assumes merge method is `SQUASH`. You can
override the merge method by changing the value of `MERGE_METHOD` parameter (one
of `MERGE`, `SQUASH` or `REBASE`):

```yaml
```

### Presets

Presets enable additional functionality which can be used to better personalize
default behavior of the Merge me! Action.

Available presets are:

- `DEPENDABOT_MINOR` - Merge only minor and patch dependency updates for pull
  requests created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows
  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).
- `DEPENDABOT_PATCH` - Merge only patch dependency updates for pull requests
  created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows
  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).

```yaml
```

### Number of retries

In case the merge action fails, by default it will automatically be retried up
to three times using an exponential backoff strategy. This means, the first
retry will happen 1 second after the first failure, while the second will happen
4 seconds after the previous, the third 9 seconds, and so on.

It's possible to configure the number of retries by providing a value for
`MAXIMUM_RETRIES` (by default, the value is `3`).

```yaml
```

### Enable for manual changes

There are cases in which manual changes are needed, for instance, in order to
make the CI pass or to solve some conflicts that Dependabot (or the bot you are
using) cannot handle. By default, this GitHub action will skip this case where
the author is not [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot) (or the bot you
are using). This is often desirable as the author might prefer to get a code
review before merging the changes. For this, it checks whether all commits were
made by the original author and that the commit signature is valid.

It is possible to override this default behavior by setting the value of
`ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES` to `'true'`.

```yaml
```

> Important: Please note the single quotes around `true`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to
consume this package in your project.

### Prerequisites

Minimal requirements to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v14, installation instructions can be found
  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use
  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be
  installed in a
  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).
- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the
  documentation will follow the npm syntax.
- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.

### Installing

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
```

In case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by
using
[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action/archive/master.zip) and
extracting the downloaded archive.

Go the the right directory and install dependencies:

```bash
```

That's it! You can now go to the next step.

## Testing

All tests are being executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). All tests files
live side-to-side with a source code and have a common suffix: `.spec.ts`. Some
helper methods are being stored in the `test` directory.

There are three helper scripts to run tests in the most common scenarios:

```bash
```

## Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All
supported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one
of the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:

```bash
```

## Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.
TypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc). You can
use one of the following scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the
files:

```bash
```

## Publishing

Publishing is handled in an automated way and must not be performed manually.

Each commit to the master branch is automatically tagged using
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

## Tips

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Read mdBook version from file

How to sync a mdBook version between a Docker Compose and a GitHub Actions workflow via `.env` file.

Write a `MDBOOK_VERSION` to the `.env` file like the following and push it to a remote branch.

```sh
```

Next, add a step to read a mdBook version from the `.env` file.

```yaml
```

Here is a `docker-compose.yml` example.

```yaml
```

The alpine base mdBook Docker image is provided on the following repository.

# Project management automation

This is a [GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions) which contains various automations to assist with project management in a Github repository.

## Available Automations

- `todos`: Parses for `@todo` or `@TODO` comments in code and adds as inline review comments for reviews on pull request, and creates issues for each one if they exist when a pull is merged.

## Installation and Usage

To use the action, include it in your workflow configuration file:

```yaml
```

## API

### Inputs

- `github_token`: Required. GitHub API token to use for making API requests. This should be stored as a secret in the GitHub repository.
- `automations`: Optional. You can include a comma-delimited list of specific automations you want to run if you don\'t want to use them all in a given workflow.

### Outputs

_None._

## Contributing

This will be expanded, but for reference:

### Developing

- Clone the repo and then `npm install`.

### Builds and releases

- All pushes to master will automatically build the `dist/index.js` file for the action (then commit and push to master). So no need to worry about builds.
- For releases, make sure you update the examples in the `README.md` if releasing a major version, otherwise just create a release manually (in the future this may get automated for releases).

### Adding a new automation.

The design of this repository is setup so that automations can be their own discrete thing (eg. ""todos"") but still take advantage of various scaffolding and boilerplate when creating a new automation. The following is a rough list of steps to take to create and add a new automation:

- Create a new directory in `lib/automations` that is the name of your automation.
- Your `lib/automations` directory must at a minimum export the following from the `index.js` file in the directory:

```js
```
- As noted above, this export must include a `runner` for your automation. The runner is an async function that will receive two arguments: `context` (which is the GitHub action context value) and `octokit` (which is the GitHub api helper). See more about these two arguments [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/github) (they are essentially what gets exposed by the `@actions/github` package). You can use the [`todos` runner as an example](https://github.com/nerrad/automations/blob/master/lib/automations/todos/runner.js).
- Finally, in [`lib/automations.js`](https://github.com/nerrad/automations/blob/master/lib/automations.js), makes sure you import your automation configuration into this file and add it to the `moduleNames` array. So for example, if your automation was setup in `lib/automations/my-automation`, you would have something like this in the file after your changes:

```js
```

- make sure you list your automation name and a brief description of what it does in the **Available Automations** section of this readme file.

That\'s it!

Don\'t forget to add tests for your automation. There are various helpers available for mocking the `context` and `octokit` values (you can view the various todos automation tests for examples).


## Credits

- Thanks to the work of the [Gutenberg team](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) (particularly [@aduth](https://github.com/aduth)) in providing some inspiration for this approach to bundling various automations together.
- The `todos` automation was inspired by this [todo probot app](https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo). Initial iterations of this action borrowed heavily from the ideas in this app.

# install-with-cpanm

GitHub action to install Perl Modules [App::cpanminus](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus)

This action installs \'cpanminus\' then use it if needed to install some Perl Modules.

```yaml
```

## Using install-with-cpanm in a GitHub workflow

Here is a sample integration using install-with-cpanm action
to test your Perl Modules using multiple Perl versions via the
perl-tester images.

```yaml
```

## Inputs

### `install`

List of one or more modules, separated by a newline `\
` character.

### `cpanfile`

Install modules from a cpanfile.

### `tests`

Boolean variable used to disable unit tests during installation
Possible values: true | false [default: false]

### `verbose`

Boolean variable used to control the `-v` flag
Possible values: true | false [default: false]

Note: this was previously set to true by default,
this is now disabled to speedup installations.

### `args`

Extra arguments to pass to the cpanm command line used by `install` or `cpanfile`.

example:
```yaml
```

You can also use this option to run your own flavor
without the need of setting `install` or `cpanfile`.
```yaml
```

### `sudo`

Run commands as sudo: true | false [default: true]

### `perl`

Which perl path to use. Default to use `perl` from the current `PATH`.
By setting PATH correctly you probably do not need to use it.

### `path`

Where to install `cpanm`. Default value is `$Config{installsitescript}/cpanm`.
You can use any `$Config` variable in your string.

## Outputs

none

## Example usage

### Install cpanm and use it manually later

```yaml
```

but you should prefer let the action install your modules

### Install cpanm and a single module

```yaml
```

### Install cpanm and multiple modules

```yaml
```

### Install modules from a cpanfile

```yaml
```

### Install a module and enable tests

Install modules with tests.

```yaml
```

### Using install-with-cpanm on Windows / win32

Here is a sample job using cpanm to install modules on windows.

# setup-ruby-pkgs

Cross platform action that installs Ruby, along with tools and packages needed for compiling.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If one is using Actions image \'windows-2022\' or later, [ruby/setup-ruby]
installs all packages needed to compile/build Windows Rubies, versions 2.5 and later.
Hence, if you don\'t need any additional tools or packages, please use [ruby/setup-ruby].

The action\'s inputs are shown below:

```yaml
```

## Input Information

Information on inputs passed to [ruby/setup-ruby] is contained in its [README] and
[action.yml] files.

All inputs are optional.

### apt-get: (Ubuntu)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited. Special options are `_update_`, `_upgrade_`, and `_dist-upgrade_`.

If `_upgrade_` or `_dist-upgrade_` are included, `_update_` will also be done.

If neither is included and you\'re just installing  package(s), `_update_` WILL NOT BE DONE unless it\'s included.


### brew: (macOS)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited. Special options are `_update_` and `_upgrade_`, and both work similar to `apt-get:`.

### mingw: (Windows)

* **Ruby 2.4 & later**<br/>
  List of MSYS2 MinGW packages to install.<br/>
  Space delimited.  The package prefix (`mingw-w64-x86_64-` or `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-`) is not required.<br/>
  If `_upgrade_` is included in the input, all packages needed by the gcc tools are updated.<br/>
  If `openssl` is included, an appropriate package will be installed.

* **Ruby 2.3 & earlier**<br/>
  The following DevKit packages are available:<br/>
    * libffi-3.2.1
    * openssl-1.0.2j
    * ragel-6.7
    * sqlite-3.7.15.2  (sqlite3)
    * zlib-1.2.8

### msys2: (Windows)

* **Ruby 2.4 & later**<br/>
  List of MSYS2 packages to install.  Space delimited.  These are command line utilities and are rarely needed.

* **Ruby 2.3 & earlier**<br/
  No action, as no utilities are available for the older MSYS/DevKit.

### mswin: (Windows)

Installs MSYS2 packages.  These are typically build utilities, such as bison, ragel, etc.
As in pacman, MinGW packages must be prefixed with `mingw-w64-x86_64-` or `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-`.

### choco: (Windows)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited.  Most packages are compiled with msvc, so normally used with mswin builds.
Currently, the mswin Ruby build is compiled using [microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) packages, so
use of choco packages is discouraged.

### vcpkg: (Windows)

List of packages to install.  Space delimited.  All packages are compiled with msvc, so normally used with mswin builds.  An environment variable `OPT_DIR` is set to
```ruby
```

After install, the tools folder is checked, and if any files are present, it is added to path.

## Getting Started

To get started using the action, just make sure to have a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#define-a-procfile) or a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) in your project and then create a folder called **.github** and inside it, create another folder called **workflows**. Finally inside the workflows folder, create a file called **main.yml** with the following contents:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Now go to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings. Scroll to the bottom until you see API Key. Copy this key and go to your project\'s repository on GitHub.

In your Repo, go to Settings -> Secrets and click on ""New Secret"". Then enter HEROKU_API_KEY as the name and paste the copied API Key as the value.

You can now push your project to GitHub and it will be automatically deployed to Heroku henceforth.

You learn more about GitHub Secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) and GitHub Actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Important Note

**Please Note**: Git has recently announced that it is planning to switch the default branch\'s name from ""**master**"" to ""**main**"". For this reason, the Action also pushes to the ""**main**"" branch in the heroku origin by default and if your Heroku App is still using the ""**master**"" branch, then the Action will automatically switch your Heroku remote to use ""**main**"" as the default branch. There is **No Action Needed** from you, just keep in mind that this change is occurring as you continue to use the App and if you ever need to manually deploy the App, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
```

Also the `remote_branch` property no longer exists in the latest release of the Action. If you still have this as part of the `3.10.9` release. Please remove it as it may cause problems in your workflow

**Please Note**: While creating a new project on Heroku, **do not** enable the option for **Automatic Deployments** as this would result in an error when the GitHub Action is triggered.

## Options

The action comes with additional options that you can use to configure your project\'s behavior on Heroku. You can setup these options under the ""with"" object as presented above:

| Name                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                               |

## Examples

### Deploy with Docker

Heroku now allows users to deploy docker containers. To use this feature, simply add a Dockerfile to your project and add a `CMD` command at the end of the Dockerfile. This is the command used by heroku to start the webserver inside the container. Finally make sure to set the `usedocker` flag to true before deploying.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          usedocker: true
```

Keep in mind that if you deploy once using docker, the same heroku app is not compatible with a non-docker setup and similarly, you cannot deploy a dockerized setup to a non-docker heroku app.

If you need to pass in any ARGs for the Docker build, you may provide a list of arg names which automatically pull from the environment.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          usedocker: true
          docker_build_args: |
            NODE_ENV
            SECRET_KEY
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production
          SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_KEY }}
```

Also, thanks to [Olav Sundf\xc3\xb8r](https://github.com/olaven) for adding the Docker feature and [Matt Stavola](https://github.com/mbStavola) for adding the ability to pass in build args.

### Deploy with custom Buildpacks

Taken from the official heroku website:

""Heroku Buildpacks are sets of open source scripts that are used for compiling apps on Heroku. They form the backbone of Heroku\xe2\x80\x99s [polyglot platform](https://www.heroku.com/languages). Buildpacks enable you to extend Heroku\'s build system to support your language or customizations, or to make particular binary packages available to the runtime. Heroku Buildpacks give you the freedom to code in the languages and frameworks that work best for your app and your team""

To use a custom buildpack in the action, simply add the url of the buildpack to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          buildpack: ""https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git""
```

### Deploy Subdirectory

If you are using a complex application which has both frontend and backend applications in separate folders, you can specify a path to the directory to deploy using the **appdir** option:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          appdir: ""api"" # <- This will point to the api folder in your project
```

Thanks to [meszarosdezso](https://github.com/meszarosdezso) for adding the appdir feature

### Deploy custom branch

You can use the **branch** option to deploy an app in another branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

### Deploy custom remote branch

You can use the **remote_branch** option to deploy an app to another remote branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

### Set stack for your app

In some cases, you need to change the default stack - heroku-20.
For example, If you are building docker images with heroku yml, you need to change the stack to container.
You can use the **stack** option to change stack for your app.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

## Health Check

Sometimes you will run into issues where the action has successfully deployed the project but because of some error in code or the like, the Heroku App crashes or fails to launch. To counter this, you can setup a healthcheck in the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Adding the url to the healthcheck option of the action will make the action attempt to perform a GET Request to that url and print the response if successful. Else it will fail the action to indicate that the deploy was not successful.

P.S: It is recommended that you setup a specific route such as **/health** for performing healthchecks

### Advanced Usage

Additionally, if you are using a custom route for performing healthchecks, you can check for a specific value from this url using the **checkstring** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          checkstring: ""ok""
```

This will essentially check if the value returned by sending a GET request to the **healthcheck** url is equal to the **checkstring**

### Adding Delay

In some cases, a healthcheck ends up being performed before the application has been setup on Heroku. To counter this, you can manually set the **delay** option in the action to make the action wait a certain period of time (in seconds) before performing the healthcheck

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          checkstring: ""ok""
          delay: 5
```

By default, the delay will be 0 if you choose to not set it

### Rollback on healthcheck failure

You can set the rollbackonhealthcheckfailed option to ensure that your application is rolled back if the healthcheck fails.
_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
          checkstring: ""ok""
          rollbackonhealthcheckfailed: true
```

By default, the application will not be rolled back if the healthcheck fails.

Thanks to [FridaTveit](https://github.com/FridaTveit) for adding this feature

## Environment Variables

Heroku offers a means of passing sensitive information to your app (such as api keys etc) via something it calls **config vars** which you can find in the settings of your heroku app. But sometimes you might want to store sensitive information (api keys etc) in GitHub Secrets instead just to ensure platform independence. If you choose to this, you can then pass those secrets to your heroku app by using the ""env"" object of the action:-

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Note that the variables must start with ""**HD\\_**"". This is is important so the action can tell your environment variable apart from multiple other variables (passed by your language, github actions etc) which you probably don\'t want sitting in your heroku app\'s config vars.

On that note, if you\'ve set these variables and have deployed your app, you can check your Heroku App\'s config vars and you\'ll find that they have been set with the env variables you have passed.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The ""**HD\\_**"" will be scrapped from the variable your name by the action. So in your project, ""**FIREBASE_API_KEY**"" will be passed instead of ""**HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY**"" (for example) and you can see this if you check your Heroku App\'s config vars. We understand that this can be confusing but this is again to ensure Platform independence and so that you don\'t have to use HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY if you choose to stop using Heroku

### ENV File

You can if you wish also pass the path to an env file (with respect to your appdir path) as an option to the action. The action will then read that file and set the config vars accordingly in Heroku

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Example env file

```
```

There are two important points to keep in mind when using the **env_file** option.

1. The first is that in can be used in conjunction with **env** option of the action as you have seen above

2. The second is that unlike in the **env** option, you do not need to prefix the env variables in the .env file with ""HD\\_"".

   (For those of you who are wondering why this is the case, when using the **env** option, the env variables are passed directly into the process along with all the other env variables passed by GitHub Actions, the language you are using etc and the ""HD\\_"" in that case is to help differentiate your env variables from them. But when using a file to pass the env variables, the action manually reads the file so there is no chance of stray env variables being passed by your language, github actions etc and hence no need to add the ""HD\\_"")

Also note that using a file (which can be named anything so long as it follows the format of a standard env file) can be useful if you\'re trying to send a very large number of env variables to Heroku, it does mean that keeping the .env file secure and private is entirely in your hands so tread with caution.

## Procfile Passing

In some cases, you might want to be able to set the Procfile within the action itself instead of declaring it manually in your project. Although this approach is not recommended in favor of just using multiple branches, it might still be useful in some edge cases. You can set the Procfile in the action by using the **procfile** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

Keep in mind this won\'t work if you are using Docker.

## Deploying to a team

If you are an enterprise user and wish to deploy your app to a specific team, you can do so by just passing the **team** option to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

## Just Login

GitHub Actions does come with the heroku cli pre-installed (this is what is used by the Action to deploy applications). So if you wish to use the heroku cli and just need to login, you can use the **justlogin** option of the Heroku Deploy Action

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

```yaml
```

## Important Notes

- You can check this repo\'s [_.github/workflows/main.yml_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for example use cases of the action in use. Additionally the APIs for these use cases can be found in the [_tests_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/tree/master/tests) folder of the repo

- You can find the secrets tab in your project\'s settings

- Be careful with your appname, cuz the action either deploys to an existing app or creates a new one if it doesn\'t exist. So if you accidently change it after deploying it once already, the action won\'t fail, it\'ll just create a new dyno and if you are on a paid plan, heroku can be expensive. On that note, always check the logs of your actions to make sure everything is A-OK.

- If you\'re using the above exact workflow code, keep in mind that it deploys whenever you make a change to the master branch (Even README updates which have nothing to do with application code) and that might not be very efficient for you, have a look through the github actions docs to customize when the action should trigger.

  (I would recommend making a separate dev branch and setting up the action to trigger upon pull request to the master branch)

- By default, if you don\'t specify a branch in your action, it will default to the HEAD branch (or whichever branch the action is defined under). So you might be wondering what happens if you define the same action in a different branch under the same heroku app name (or which you try to deploy to the same appname from a different branch)? The answer is that the new branch overrides whatever your old branch was (even if the new branch is behind the old branch in terms of commits unless you set dontuseforce to true)

Automatically close issues or pull requests whose body text does not match the specified regular expression pattern.
This is useful to enforce usage of issue/PR templates.

## Installation

To configure the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/main.workflow` workflow file:

```yml
```

## Configuration

`issue-close-message` and `pr-close-message` are ES6-style template literals which will be evaluated with the issue or pull request
webhook payload in context. The example above uses `${issue.user.login}` to get the author of the issue.

* `issue` webhook [payload example](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-15)
* `pull_request` webhook [payload example](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-28)

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-v1-undefined.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codecov)
### Easily upload coverage reports to Codecov from GitHub Actions 

>The latest release of this Action adds support for tokenless uploads from GitHub Actions!

## Usage

To integrate Codecov with your Actions pipeline, specify the name of this repository with a tag number (`@v1` is recommended) as a `step` within your `workflow.yml` file. 

If you have a *private repository*, this Action also requires you to [provide an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) from [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io) (tip: in order to avoid exposing your token, store it as a `secret`). Optionally, you can choose to include up to four additional inputs to customize the upload context. **For public repositories, no token is needed**

Inside your `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` file:

```yaml
```
>**Note**: This assumes that you've set your Codecov token inside *Settings > Secrets* as `CODECOV_TOKEN`. If not, you can [get an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) for your specific repo on [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io). Keep in mind that secrets are *not* available to forks of repositories. 

## Arguments

Codecov's Action currently supports five inputs from the user: `token`, `file`, `flags`,`name`, and `fail_ci_if_error`. These inputs, along with their descriptions and usage contexts, are listed in the table below: 

>**Update**: We've removed the `yml` paramter with the latest release of this action. Please put your custom codecov yaml file at the root of the repo because other locations will no longer be supported in the future.

| Input  | Description | Usage |
| :---:     |     :---:   |    :---:   |
| `token`  | Used to authorize coverage report uploads  | *Required for private repos* |
| `file`  | Path to the coverage report(s) | Optional
| `flags`  | Flag the upload to group coverage metrics (unittests, uitests, etc.). Multiple flags are separated by a comma (ui,chrome) | Optional
| `name`  | Custom defined name for the upload | Optional
| `fail_ci_if_error`  | Specify if CI pipeline should fail when Codecov runs into errors during upload. *Defaults to **false*** | Optional

525,"# Configurable Github Action For Building and Optionally Deploying Jekyll Builds.\r
\r
Goes to a configured directory, optionally destroys the Gemfile.lock, builds the jekyll site, and optionally goes to a configured directory to push to specified branch of the repo.\r
\r
Really helpful if you just want to build your site and let another action in your workflow do something with it... like [push to s3 maybe?](https://github.com/jakejarvis/s3-sync-action)\r
\r
## Options\r
\r
Set these in the `env` of the github action.\r
BUILD_DIR and REMOTE_BRANCH don\'t matter if DEPLOY_SITE is not `true`... obviously.\r
\r
\r
`JEKYLL_ROOT` **Default**:`./`  If your jekyll site isn\'t at the root if your repo, change this so that a `cd` command points to the jekyll root.\r
\r
\r
`GEMFILE` **Default**:`Gemfile` If you aren\'t using a default named Gemfile; change its name here.\r
\r
\r
`REMOVE_GEMLOCK` **Default**:`true` When `true` we\'ll `rm Gemfile.lock` before trying to build the jekyll site.\r
\r
\r
`DELETE_BEFORE_BUILD` **Default**:`no default!`... If set calls `rm -rf <>` before building the site... Useful for removing directories you don\'t want in your final site for whatever reason.\r
\r
\r
`DEPLOY_SITE` **Default**:`true` If we should try and build the site and deploy it the REMOTE_DIR.\r
\r
\r
`BUILD_DIR` **Default**:`_site/` What directly will the site get built into.  *This is telling our deployment actions where to work, it does NOT change where your site gets built into, use your `_config.yml` for that*.\r
\r
\r
`REMOTE_BRANCH` **Default**:`gh-pages` Which branch of the repo should we push our BUILD_DIR to?\r
\r
\r
## Example\r
\r
This would build and deploy the jekyll site contained within the `MySite` dir of the repo to the `staging` branch of the repo when ever the `dev` branch gets pushed to.\r
\r
Change `dev` to `master` if and remove the `JEKYLL_ROOT` and `REMOTE_BRANCH` `env` settings if you want vanilla default actions to happen when master gets pushed.\r
\r
The `GITHUB_*` env variables are populated by github actions, they must be defined but you don\'t need to set them yourself. \r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
## Multiple sites\r
\r
This isn\'t tested but it should be possible within the same job.  Just explicitly state all the env variables for each `- name`\'d use of the action.  \r
\r
## Gotchas\r
\r
**Changes pushed to your gh-pages branch will only be picked up by the Github Pages server if your workflow is in a private repository.**\r

526,"# `install-qt-action`

Installing Qt on Github Actions workflows manually is the worst.

You know what's easier than dealing with that? Just using this:
```yml
```

All done.

## Options

### `version`
The desired version of Qt to install.

Default: `5.12.6` (Latest LTS at the time of writing)

### `host`
This is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It's unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.

For example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.

Possible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`

Defaults to the current platform it is being run on.

### `target`
This is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. 

**Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts**

Possible values: `desktop`, `android`, or `ios`

Default: `desktop`

### `arch`
This is the target architecture that your program will be built for. This is only used for Windows and Android.

**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro's repository or building it manually.

**Possible values:**

Windows: `win64_msvc2017_64`, `win64_msvc2015_64`, `win32_msvc2015`, `win32_mingw53`, or `win64_mingw73`

Android: `android_x86`, `android_armv7`

**Default values:**

Windows: `win64_msvc2017_64`

Android: `android_armv7`

### `dir`
This is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.

For example, if you set dir to `/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `/example/Qt/5.12.6/(your_arch)/bin`. When possible, access your Qt directory through the `Qt5_Dir` environment variable.

Default: `${RUNNER_WORKSPACE}` (this is one folder above the starting directory)

### `install-deps`
Whether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux (you probably want to leave this on).

Default: `true`

### `modules`
List of additional addon modules to install, with each entry seperated by a space. If you need one of these, you'll know it.

Possible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, possibly others

Default: none

### `cached`
If it is set to `true`, then Qt won't be downloaded, but the environment variables will be set, and essential build tools will be installed.

It can be used with [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache), for example:

```
```

### `aqtversion`

Version of [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall), in the form used by pip, for example: `==0.7.1`, `>=0.7.1`, `==0.7.*`.

## More info

The Qt bin directory is added to your `path` environment variable. `Qt5_Dir` is also set appropriately for cmake. 

Big thanks to the [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/) developers for making this easy. Please go support them, they did all of the hard work here.

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail

Instead of using your normal Google password, use an App password.

1. [Enable 2-Step Verification.](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid).

2. [Create an App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for `Mail`.

### Unauthenticated login (username/password fields)

The parameters `username` and `password` are set as optional to support self-hosted runners access to on-premise infrastructure. If
you are accessing public email servers make sure you provide a username/password authentication through [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to make the email delivery secure.

## About ##

Post notification to fediverse social web when code is updated.
Currently it was tested with Mastodon service,
Support for other ActivityPub services
like pleroma or GNUsocial is also welcome.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Fediverse_logo_proposal.svg/330px-Fediverse_logo_proposal.svg.png)

## Usage ##

### Join fediverse ###

- If you didn\'t before register to an instance of mastodon network:
  - example: <https://mastodon.social>
- Once registered and logged, go to settings page to create an application:
  - example: <https://mastodon.social/settings/profile>
- Go to ""Settings"" / ""Development"" / ""New Application""
  - example: <https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/>
  - example: <https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new>
- Fill application name: mastodon-lite (or anything else),
  ignore  other fields
- Submit to generate application
  - example: <https://mastodon.social/settings/applications>
- Go to application details and note ""access token""
  - example: ""B4DC0D-DeadBeef1BadCode-1TODO-1TODOtodoTODO""

### Add secret to github ###

- From your project page:
  - <https://github.com/${org}/${project}/settings/secrets>
- Add new secret with name ""MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN""
  and the previous  encoded string as value.

### Commit config file ###

To enable this ""action"" in any of your github hosted project,
a configuration file should be located in "".github/workflow/"" subdir, just like:

- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rzr/fediverse-action/master/.github/workflows/fediverse-action.yml>

Back to your project you can create "".github/workflows/fediverse-action.yml""
file by applying this patch from shell:

``` {.bash org-language=""sh""}
```

Or pick it from:

- <https://github.com/rzr/fediverse-action/commit/40dc4bccfb3d8b6efd26327a412b73bbe2f7113d.patch>

Then check action\'s status on github,
a default message should then appears on
a ""mastodon.social"" profile, something like:

- <https://mastodon.social/@tizenhelper/103781386501900694>
- <https://mastodon.social/tags/FediVerseAction>

Note default ""mastodon.social"" server will be used
unless you override a host value:

``` {.yml}
```

Example:

- <https://github.com/Tarnyko/test-mastodon/commit/414d3191c5a394caac5ed67fe40de24caf063498>

Default message will link to your repo URL.

### Customize commit message ###

Once posting is verified,
then apply this next change to overload default message
with your project\'s latest git commit message.

```sh
```

- <https://github.com/abandonware/bmp085-sensor/commit/5701e5c3>

``` {.yml}
```

Feel free to edit ""message"" input with anything you prefer.

Examples:

- <https://github.com/abandonware/bmp085-sensor/commit/5701e5c3e0773fedc65b5477a45005783a30cb63>
- <https://mastodon.social/@tizenhelper/103810982954496420>

529,"# Release for Reddit

Automate submitting a Reddit post about your release using the Reddit API.

You don\'t need to be a moderator of a subreddit to use this. In fact, this action is only tested using a regular account.

## Setup API

Before using this action, you will need to have access to the Reddit API.

1. Make sure you\'re logged in to your Reddit account, and go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps.

2. Create an app for this action.

![Create app](./.github/images/create-app.png)

3. Once created, find the app ID and secret.

> **Warning**
> DO NOT share the app secret in public. The image below is an invalid secret to show as an example.

![App view](./.github/images/app-view.png)

4. You can follow the steps below to configure the action. If you\'re interested, you can follow [Reddit\'s cURL quick start](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example) to test this app. (If you get rate limit issues, make sure to set a different user agent)

## Get into Action

> **Note**
> Make sure you have configured your API/app before continuing below. If haven\'t, see the instructions above.

1. Set the secrets for usage in GitHub Actions. Go to your repo > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret.

Add secrets for:

- REDDIT_USERNAME: Your Reddit username
- REDDIT_PASSWORD: Your Reddit password
- REDDIT_APP_ID: The app ID
- REDDIT_APP_SECRET: The app secret

2. Configure the workflow. Here, we use the secrets we set earlier and add parameters for the action. See the [full list of parameters](#parameters).

```yml
```

3. Create a release!

> While this action is meant for releases, you can also configure it to be triggered on each push or pull request. If so, make sure to set the `title` and `url` parameters since they, by default, use values from a release.

## Parameters

#### `username`

**Required** Your Reddit username.

#### `password`

**Required** Your Reddit password.

#### `app-id`

**Required** The app ID.

#### `app-secret`

**Required** The app secret.

#### `subreddit`

**Required** The subreddit to post.

#### `title`

**Optional** The post title.

Default: `${{ github.repository }} ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }} Released`

The default would output e.g. ""bluwy/awesome-lib v1.0.0 Released""

> More info on the different contexts that can be used: [Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)

> All available properties of `github.event.release`: [Example response object](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release)

#### `url`

**Optional** The post URL.

Default: `${{ github.event.release.html_url }}`

The default would output e.g. ""https://github.com/bluwy/awesome-lib/releases/tag/v1.0.0"". If the URL links to a Reddit post, it\'ll do a crosspost instead.

#### `flair-id`

**Optional** The post flair\'s ID. [More info](#how-do-i-set-a-flair)

#### `flair-text`

**Optional** The post flair\'s text (applicable if text_editable is true). [More info](#how-do-i-set-a-flair).

#### `comment`

**Optional** A comment to add for your post. You can use this as a changelog excerpt for the lazy. Will not comment if this is not set or empty.

For example, if your changelog happens to be your release description, you can set this to `${{ github.event.release.body }}`.

#### `notification`

**Optional** Whether to have replies on post and comments to be sent to inbox. Set `true` to enable.

Default: `false`

#### `retry-rate-limit`

**Optional** How many times to retry if it hits the rate limit. This will wait for the limit to end before retrying. To disable retries, set this to `0`. [More info](#whats-the-rate-limit-error).

Default: `1`

## Outputs

Output can be accessed in `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<key> }}`, where `<id>` is the id of a step, `<key>` is the values below.

#### `postUrl`

The link to the post if successfully submitted.

> Tip: You can pass this url back to another reddit action\'s `url` parameter to do a crosspost! [Example](https://github.com/bluwy/release-for-reddit-action-test/blob/f0ff92913e453ac14b590445d60c99ede8516148/.github/workflows/release.yml#L32).

#### `commentUrl`

The link to the comment if a comment text is defined and succesfully submitted.

## FAQs

#### Why do I need to provide my username and password? It already has my app\'s ID and secret.

That\'s how the Reddit OAuth API works. To get the access token, you have to supply your username, password, app ID and app secret.

Check out [Reddit\'s quick start example](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example) which also requires the four information for authentication. (If you get rate limit issues, make sure to set a different user agent)

#### How do I set a flair?

Setting a flair requires its flair ID. To find the supported flairs for a subreddit, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/api/link_flair.json. Replace ""subreddit"" with your target subreddit and make sure you\'re logged in for this to work.

The endpoint will return a list of flairs in JSON format, which you can choose one using the flair id.

If the flair\'s `text_editable` property is true, you can set the `flair-text` parameter to set a custom text for the flair.

#### What\'s the rate limit error?

There are two kinds of rate limit in Reddit. One is the request limit to the `oauth.reddit.com` endpoint, which is a generous 600 request per 10 minutes. This action will never hit this limit unless you\'re also using the API for other clients.

The other rate limit is for post and comments submissions. If you start with a new account, it\'s very likely to get up to 10 minutes of rate limiting. You will likely hit this issue more often than the `oauth` rate limit.

Though Reddit doesn\'t explicitly tell how the submission rate limit is calculated, various sources from the admins mentioned that having an older account and higher karma (especially in the specific subreddit) helps reduce this limit.

> In the development of this action, the rate limit was significantly reduced after the 24 hour mark of account creation.

#### What\'s the `invalid-grant` error?

If you encounter this error, make sure your credentials are entered correctly, which are your username, password, app ID and app secret.

If this does not work, follow [Reddit\'s cURL quick start](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example) and try to retrive an access token. (If you get rate limit issues, make sure to set a different user agent). If it works, please file an issue!

If the above didn\'t work, create a new account and use that instead. (This also happened to me).

> Keep in mind that new accounts are heavily rate limited.

532,"# WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update

> Deploy readme and asset updates to the WordPress Plugin Repository.

[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/LICENSE)

This Action commits any readme and WordPress.org-specific assets changes in your specified branch to the WordPress.org plugin repository if no other changes have been made since the last deployment to WordPress.org. This is useful for updating things like screenshots or `Tested up to` separately from functional changes, provided your Git branching methodology avoids changing anything else in the specified branch between functional releases. It is **highly recommended** that you use a stable branch where you only merge readme/asset commits in between larger functional merges that only occur when preparing for a release (often implemented as `master` vs. `develop`).

Because the WordPress.org plugin repository shows information from the readme in the specified `Stable tag`, this Action also attempts to parse out the stable tag from your readme and deploy to there as well as `trunk`. If your stable tag is `trunk` or a tag that does not exist in the `tags` subfolder, it will skip that part of the update and only update `trunk` and/or `assets`.

**Important note:** If your development process leads to a situation where `master` (or other specified branch) only contains changes to the readme or assets directory since the last sync to the plugin directory and those changes are in preparation for the next release, those changes will go live and potentially be misleading to users. Usage of this Action assumes a fairly traditional Git methodology that involves merging all changes to `master` when functional changes are ready and that this seemingly unlikely situation will therefore not happen in your repo; there are no safeguards against syncing changes based on readme/asset content, as that cannot be predicted.

### \xe2\x98\x9e This Action is meant to be used in tandem with our [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy)

### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)

## Configuration

### Required secrets

* `SVN_USERNAME`
* `SVN_PASSWORD`

[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.

### Optional environment variables

* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.
* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`).
* `README_NAME` - defaults to `readme.txt`, customizable in case you use `README.md` instead, which is now quietly supported in the WordPress.org plugin repository.

## Example Workflow File

```yml
```

### Known issues

* It would be more efficient to additionally use the `paths` filter for the `push` action to reduce the number of runs. So far in testing it is possible to limit it to pushes that include readme/asset files as specified, but not ones that *only* include those files. The Action itself still needs to run as written because it compares the totality of changes in the branch against what\'s in SVN and not just the contents of the current push.

## Changelog

533,"# Actions Tagger

:speedboat: Keep your action versions up-to-date by automatically promoting a major tag (and optionally, a `latest` tag) each time a release is created.

# Rationale

According to the github actions [versioning guide](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md#versioning), actions publishers should have a major tag (`v1`, `v2`, etc) which points to the latest version of any minor/patch release of their action, for ease of use by the others.

I found this process quite tedious, and repetetive which is why this action exists. If you have published an action and would like to have your action follow the same versioning structure as many others in the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions), then simply create a release workflow that includes this action. See the [_usage_ example](#sample-usage).

# Inputs

### `publish_latest_tag`

Indicates to the action whether or not to create/update a tag called `latest` pointing to the latest release. **Default: `""false""`**.

### `prefer_branch_releases`

Do you prefer creating `vN` branches or `vN` tags? **Default: `""false""`**

### `token`

A github token used for creating an octoclient for making API calls. **Default: `${{ github.token }}`**.

## Outputs

### `tag`

The version of the branch/tag that was published/updated.

### `latest`

Was _latest_ also published?

### <strike>`ref_name`</strike>
**Deprecated in v3:** _Use [`tag`](#tag)_

# Env Inputs

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**Deprecated in v3:** _If a non-default PAT (Personal Access Token) is needed, use [`token`](#token) instead._

# Debug Logging

This action supports [debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging#enabling-step-debug-logging). When enabled, it will dump the output of the
api call for creating the tags/branches.
This is useful for testing and should be included when reporting bugs.

# Sample Usage

`versioning.yml`

```yaml
```

_Note this action is able to detect if it is being run in a **release** context, and if not it will notify you and exit gracefully._

535,"# GitHub Actions for DigitalOcean

This action enables you to interact with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) services by installing [the `doctl` command-line client](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl).

## Usage

To install the latest version of `doctl` and use it in GitHub Actions workflows, [create a DigitalOcean API token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/), [add it as a secret to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository), and add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
```

`doctl` will now be available in the virtual environment and can be used directly in following steps. As an example, one common use case is retrieving the credentials for a Kubernetes cluster hosted on DigitalOcean for use in a deployment workflow:

```yaml
```

See [this repository](https://github.com/do-community/example-doctl-action) for a full end-to-end example that also demonstrates building a Docker image, pushing it to a private DigitalOcean container registry, and using `kubectl` to deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean.

### Arguments

- `token` \xe2\x80\x93 (**Required**) A DigitalOcean personal access token ([more info](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/)).
- `version` \xe2\x80\x93 (Optional) The version of `doctl` to install. If excluded, the latest release will be used.

536,"## merge-release

GitHub Action for automated npm publishing.

This Action publishes a package to npm. It is meant to be used on every successful merge to master but 
you\'ll need to configure that workflow yourself. You can look to the
[`.github/workflows/push.yml`](./.github/workflows/mikeals-workflow.yml) file in this project as an example.

### Workflow

* Check for the latest version number published to npm.
* Lookup all commits between the git commit that triggered the action and the latest publish.
  * If the package hasn\'t been published or the prior publish does not include a git hash, we\'ll
    only pull the commit data that triggered the action.
* Based on the commit messages, increment the version from the lastest release.
  * If the string ""BREAKING CHANGE"" is found anywhere in any of the commit messages or descriptions the major 
    version will be incremented.
  * If a commit message begins with the string ""feat"" then the minor version will be increased. This works
    for most common commit metadata for feature additions: `""feat: new API""` and `""feature: new API""`.
  * All other changes will increment the patch version.
* Publish to npm using the configured token.
* Push a tag for the new version to GitHub.


### Configuration

You can configure some aspects of merge-release action by passing some environmental variables.

* **GITHUB_TOKEN (required)**
  * Github token to allow tagging the version.
* **NPM_AUTH_TOKEN (required)**
  * NPM Auth Token to publish to NPM, read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) how to setup it as a secret.
* **DEPLOY_DIR**
  * The path where the dist `package.json` is to run npm publish. Defaults to the root dir.
* **SRC_PACKAGE_DIR**
  * The path where the src package.json is found. Defaults to the root dir.
* **NPM_REGISTRY_URL**
  * NPM Registry URL to use. defaults to: `https://registry.npmjs.org/`

`merge-release` will use `npm publish` unless you\'ve defined a `publish` script in your `package.json`.

538,"# SonarSource GitHub release action

This action implements the release process for all SonarSource projects. It must be used when you publish a GitHub release.

## Usage

### Release, Promotion and Publication

```yaml
```

Available options:
- publishToBinaries (default: false): enable the publication to binaries
- binariesS3Bucket (default: downloads-cdn-eu-central-1-prod): target bucket
- mavenCentralSync (default: false): enable synchronization to Maven Central, **for OSS projects only**
- slackChannel (default: build): notification Slack channel
- artifactoryRoleSuffix (default: promoter): Artifactory promoter suffix
- dryRun (default: false): perform a dry run execution

### Releasability check

If one wants to perform a releasability check for a given version without
performing an actual release, the `releasability-check` workflow can be used.
Here is an example:

``` yaml
```

## Dry Run
For testing purpose you may want to use this gh-action without really releasing.
There comes the dry run.

What the dry run will do and not do:
* Will not communicate with burger
* Will not promote any artifacts in repox
* Will not push binaries
* Will not publish to slack

Instead, it will actually print the sequence of operations that would have 
been performed based on the provided inputs defined in `with:` section.

## Versioning

Using the versioned semantic [tags](#Tags) is recommended for security and reliability.

See [GitHub: Using tags for release management](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management)
and [GitHub: Keeping your actions up to date with Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot)
.

For convenience, it is possible to use the [branches](#Branches) following the major releases.

### Tags

All the actions in this repository are released together following semantic versioning,
ie: [`5.0.0`](https://github.com/SonarSource/gh-action_release/releases/tag/5.0.0).

```yaml
```

### Branches

The `master` branch shall not be referenced by end-users.

Branches prefixed with a `v` are pointers to the last major versions, ie: [`v4`](https://github.com/SonarSource/gh-action_release/tree/v4).

```yaml
```

Note: use only branches with precaution and confidence in the provider.

## Development

The development is done on `master` and the `branch-*` maintenance branches.

### Release

Create a release from a maintained branches, then update the `v*` shortcut:

```shell
```

## Requirements

As of version 5.0.0, [the repository needs to be onboarded to the Vault](https://xtranet-sonarsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RE/pages/2466316312/HashiCorp+Vault#Onboarding-a-Repository-on-Vault).

The following secrets and permissions are required:
- development/artifactory/token/{REPO_OWNER_NAME_DASH}-promoter
- development/kv/data/slack
- development/kv/data/repox
- development/kv/data/burgr
- development/aws/sts/downloads
- secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN (provided by the GitHub Action runner)

And if using `mavenCentralSync` option:
- development/artifactory/token/{REPO_OWNER_NAME_DASH}-private-reader
- development/kv/data/ossrh

541,"# `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda`

This action sets up a `base`
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment by one of:

- locating the `conda` installation [bundled] with the available runners and
  available in `$CONDA`
- installing a specific (or latest) version of
  - [Miniconda3][miniconda-repo]
  - [Miniforge][miniforge-releases] (or Mambaforge)
  - any [constructor]-based installer by or URL or filesystem path

A `conda-build-version` or `mamba-version` may be provided to install into
`base`.

The base `condabin/` folder is added to `$PATH` and shell integration is
initialized across all platforms.

By default, this action will then create, and _activate_, an environment by one
of:

- creating a mostly-empty `test` environment, containing only the latest
  `python-version` and its dependencies
- creating an `test` environment described in a given `environment-file`:
  - an `environment.yml`-like file (which can be patched with `python-version`)
    - the patched environment will be cleaned up unless
      `clean-patched-environment-file: false` is given
  - a [lockfile](#example-7-explicit-specification)

This action correctly handles activation of environments and offers the
possibility of automatically activating the `test` environment on all shells.

> **Please** see the **[IMPORTANT](#IMPORTANT)** notes on additional information
> on environment activation.

## Environment activation

This action will by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_
activate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the
`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the
`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.

## Inputs and outputs

For a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see
[action.yml](action.yml).

### Use a different environment name or path

You can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path
by setting the `activate-environment` input option.

```yaml
```

This will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is
the path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""
Miniconda installation.

> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will
>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology. Use this to
>   avoid ""path too long""-style errors, especially on Windows.
> - Self-hosted runners can emulate the ""bundled"" Miniconda approach by
>   pre-installing a [constructor]-based installer and ensuring `$CONDA` is set
>   prior to starting `setup-miniconda`

### Activate `base` environment

If your specific workflow still needs to activate and use `base` you will need
to do **both** of:

- set `activate-environment` to an empty string
- set `auto-activate-base` to `true`

```yaml
```

## Usage examples

### Example 1: Basic usage

This example shows how to set a basic python workflow with conda using the
crossplatform available shells: `bash` and `pwsh`. On this example an
environment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`
installed for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.

```yaml
```

### Example 2: Other shells

This example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating
systems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version
available and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.

```yaml
```

### Example 3: Other options

This example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for
easier creation of test/build environments and
[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration
management. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an
environment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment
before activating the `anaconda-client-env`.

```yaml
```

### Example 4: Conda options

This example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The
priority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will
result in:

- conda-forge
- spyder-ide
- defaults

```yaml
```

### Example 5: Custom installer

Any installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)
which includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not
yet supported by Miniconda. For more, see [Example 10](#example-10-miniforge).

> Notes:
>
> - Installer downloads are cached based on their full URL: adding some
>   non-functional salt to the URL will prevent this behavior, e.g.
>   `#${{ github.run_number }}`

```yaml
```

### Example 6: Mamba

Experimental! Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.
`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires
you specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest
priority.

> Notes:
>
> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it
>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)
>   with `use-mamba: true`.

```yaml
```

### Example 7: Lockfiles

`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit
environment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution
step altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to
reproduce the environment.

This means explicitly-defined environments...

- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:
  - channels are not queried for their repo data
  - no solver is run
- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain
  platform/architecture information
- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable

This approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow
that runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.

[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock
[explicit-spec]:
  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments

```yaml
```

### Example 10: Miniforge

[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) provides a number of
alternatives to Miniconda, built from the ground up with `conda-forge` packages
and with only `conda-forge` in its default channels.

If only `miniforge-version` is provided, `Miniforge3` will be used.

```yaml
```

In addition to `Miniforge3` with `conda` and `CPython`, for each of its many
supported platforms and architectures, additional variants including
`Mambaforge` (which comes pre-installed `mamba` in addition to `conda` on all
platforms) and `Miniforge-pypy3`/`Mamabaforge-pypy3` (which replace `CPython`
with `pypy3` on Linux/MacOS) are available.

```yaml
```

## Caching

### Caching packages

If you want to enable package caching for conda you can use the
[cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) using `~/conda_pkgs_dir` as
path for conda packages.

The cache will use a explicit key for restoring and saving the cache.

This can be based in the contents of files like:

- `setup.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `environment.yml`

```yaml
```

If you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then
you may want to
[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),
as they are not included in the conda package cache.

### Caching environments

A Miniforge variant is recommended to cache deployed environments, since the
Miniconda installation path requires succesive changes of folder ownership in
order to work with the `cache` action.

Every operating system use a different Miniforge `prefix`, so if you want to
cache the environment on all of them you must use a `matrix` strategy.

```yaml
```

Then, the first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without
specifying a environment file.

```yaml
```

It\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies
of package versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. You can 
skip that step if you use a resolved environment file product of
`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.

```yaml
```

Keep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the
same as hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves
the dependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages
available on the channels at installation time. Since packages are updated
all the time, you will not see these changes reflected in the cache until
the key gets updated by date.

**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally
but fail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache
manually to see if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved
environment file.**

Finally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache
does not exist.

```yaml
```

### Use a default shell

Assuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -l {0}` to
every single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all
the steps.

By adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -l {0}`, all steps in
the job will default to that value.

For other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default
value. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.

More information the
[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).

```yaml
```

## IMPORTANT

- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly
  activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are executed
  with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash
  profile files made by `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)
  and
  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).
- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly
  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed
  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by
  `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are
  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag
  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which
  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`
  option to `true`.
- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda
  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a
  version of conda compatible with the option.
- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the
  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide
  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was
  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts
  and result in very long install times.
- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`. Please use `bash`.

542,"# Automatic publication of Python packages to PyPI

This repository defines a Github action to provide opt-in automatic publication of Python packages to PyPI upon qualifying Github release events. It also defines separate custom Github action steps for building Python wheels and source distributions, validating repository metadata, and publishing to PyPI.
This repository does not need to be cloned or interacted with in order to take advantage of the service.
See below for documentation.

Default criteria for publishing a release:
   * Tag must conform to the semantic versioning specification (https://semver.org/). i.e.
      * 0.0.8
      * 1.0.0
      * 1.0.0-alpha
      * 1.0.0-alpha.1

## How to use

The publication mechanism is provided on an opt-in basis to repositories within the following Github organizations:
   * spacetelescope

Stipulations:
   * If the project being published already exists on PyPI, the PyPI account named `stsci_maintainer` must be defined as a \'maintainer\'.
      * If you wish to specify the set of credentials used to publish the package, please see [Using other credentials](#othercreds) below.
   * If the project does not yet exist, it will be created on PyPI by the account `stsci_maintainer`.

### To add publication capability to a repository

   1) On the main repository page, click **Actions** at the top, just below the name of the repository.
   2) In the **Workflows made for your Python repository**, locate the ""*Publish to PyPI*"" workflow made by ""Space Telescope Science Institute"".
   3) Click the **Set up this workflow** button. This will open a commit page with the workflow code that will be added to the repository.
   4) Click the **Start Commit** button in the upper right hand corner.
   5) Add a descriptive commit message if you like. ""Activating automatic PyPI publication"" or similar.
   6) Click **Commit new file**.
   
Whenever a new release with a semver-compliant tag is made on Github from the repository, the package will be created and published to PyPI using the `stsci_maintainer` account.

<a name=""othercreds""></a>

### Using other credentials

The default set of credentials used to publish packages to PyPI are those of the PyPI account `stsci_maintainer`. If you want or need to use other credentials, they may be specified as secrets in the settings of the Github repository.

   1) Open the **Settings** page of the repository (top portion of the page, on the line under the repository name).
   2) Select **Secrets** from the list on the left hand side.
   3) Define a secret with the name `PYPI_USERNAME_STSCI_MAINTAINER` the value of which is the PyPI username to be used.
   4) Define another secret with the name `PYPI_PASSWORD_STSCI_MAINTAINER` the value of which is the PyPI password to be used.
   
Whenever a new release is made, the package will be created and published to PyPI using the supplied credentials.

### Testing the workflow

By default, the workflow will publish to the production PyPI repository. For testing purposes, it can be configured to publish to the test PyPI repository at https://test.pypi.org by creating a secret called `PYPI_TEST`:

   1) Open the **Settings** page of the repository (top portion of the page, on the line under the repository name).
   2) Select **Secrets** from the list on the left hand side.
   3) Define a secret with the name `PYPI_TEST` the value of which is \'true\'.

## Problems

If a problem occurs with the publication, an e-mail message with ""Run failed: Publish to PyPI"" in the subject will be sent to all users subscribed to notifications from the repository in question. The message will contain a link to the logs from the publication attempt.

544,"# Detect and Tag New Version [![test-status](https://github.com/dfreeman/action-detect-and-tag-new-version/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfreeman/action-detect-and-tag-new-version/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This action allows you to detect a new version of your repository based on some change in its contents between commits, creating a git tag if a new version is detected.

For example, in a JavaScript repo, you could detect that the `version` field in `package.json` had changed from `""1.0.0""` to `""1.1.0""` and therefore create a `v1.1.0` tag from the current commit.

## Usage

The configuration below would create a new version tag in your repository any time the contents of a `current-version.txt` file changed.

**Note**: since this action examines your git history to detect changes, you must set a `fetch-depth` of at least `2` with `actions/checkout` for that history to be present.

```yml
```

### Inputs

All inputs are optional.

 - `version-command`: a shell command that will be executed at the current HEAD and the previous commit. This command\'s
   output to stdout will be considered the effective version of your repository at a given commit. If unspecified,
   this action will attempt to determine an appropriate command to run automatically, as described below.
 - `create-tag`: may be set to `false` to only detect version changes and not create a new tag when the version changes.
 - `tag-template`: a template for producing a tag name from the current version of your repository. Any instance of
   `{VERSION}` in the string will be replaced with the actual detected version. Defaults to `v{VERSION}`.
 - `tag-annotation-template`: a template for producing a tag annotation from the current version of your repository. As
   with `tag-template`, any instance of `{VERSION}` in the string will be replaced with the actual detected version.
   May be set to an empty string to produce a lightweight (i.e. annotation-less) tag. Defaults to
   `Released version {VERSION}`.

### Outputs

 - `previous-version`: the detected previous version of this repository
 - `current-version`: the detected current version of this repository
 - `tag`: if a new tag is created, this output will contain its name

## Version Determination

If no `version-command` input is provided, this action will attempt to do something sensible by default.
 - If it finds a `package.json`, it will consider the contents of the `version` field there to be the repository version.
 - If it finds single `*.gemspec` file, it will consider the version defined there to be the repository version.

The logic for this detection and the corresponding version commands used can be found in [`determine-version.ts`](src/determine-version.ts).

546,"# GitHub Tag Action

A GitHub Action to automatically bump and tag master, on merge, with the latest SemVer formatted version. Works on any platform.

## Usage

```yaml
```

### \xf0\x9f\x93\xa5 Inputs

- **github_token** _(required)_ - Required for permission to tag the repo. Usually `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.
- **commit_sha** _(optional)_ - The commit SHA value to add the tag. If specified, it uses this value instead GITHUB_SHA. It could be useful when a previous step merged a branch into github.ref.

#### Fetch all tags

- **fetch_all_tags** _(optional)_ - By default, this action fetch the last 100 tags from Github. Sometimes, this is not enough and using this action will fetch all tags recursively (default: `false`).

#### Filter branches

- **release_branches** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (JavaScript regular expression accepted) that will generate the release tags. Other branches and pull-requests generate versions postfixed with the commit hash and do not generate any repository tag. Examples: `master` or `.*` or `release.*,hotfix.*,master`... (default: `master,main`).
- **pre_release_branches** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (JavaScript regular expression accepted) that will generate the pre-release tags.

#### Customize the tag

- **default_bump** _(optional)_ - Which type of bump to use when [none is explicitly provided](#bumping) when commiting to a release branch (default: `patch`). You can also set `false` to avoid generating a new tag when none is explicitly provided. Can be `patch, minor or major`.
- **default_prerelease_bump** _(optional)_ - Which type of bump to use when [none is explicitly provided](#bumping) when commiting to a prerelease branch (default: `prerelease`). You can also set `false` to avoid generating a new tag when none is explicitly provided. Can be `prerelease, prepatch, preminor or premajor`.
- **custom_tag** _(optional)_ - Custom tag name. If specified, it overrides bump settings.
- **create_annotated_tag** _(optional)_ - Boolean to create an annotated rather than a lightweight one (default: `false`).
- **tag_prefix** _(optional)_ - A prefix to the tag name (default: `v`).
- **append_to_pre_release_tag** _(optional)_ - A suffix to the pre-release tag name (default: `<branch>`).

#### Customize the conventional commit messages & titles of changelog sections

- **custom_release_rules** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of release rules.

  __Format__: `<keyword>:<release_type>:<changelog_section>` where `<changelog_section>` is optional and will default to [Angular's conventions](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).

  __Examples__:
    1. `hotfix:patch,pre-feat:preminor`,
    2. `bug:patch:Bug Fixes,chore:patch:Chores`

#### Debugging

- **dry_run** _(optional)_ - Do not perform tagging, just calculate next version and changelog, then exit

### \xf0\x9f\x93\xa4 Outputs

- **new_tag** - The value of the newly calculated tag. Note that if there hasn't been any new commit, this will be `undefined`.
- **new_version** - The value of the newly created tag without the prefix. Note that if there hasn't been any new commit, this will be `undefined`.
- **previous_tag** - The value of the previous tag (or `v0.0.0` if none). Note that if `custom_tag` is set, this will be `undefined`.
- **previous_version** - The value of the previous tag (or `0.0.0` if none) without the prefix. Note that if `custom_tag` is set, this will be `undefined`.
- **release_type** - The computed release type (`major`, `minor`, `patch` or `custom` - can be prefixed with `pre`).
- **changelog** - The [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) since the previous tag.

> **_Note:_** This action creates a [lightweight tag](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) by default.

### Bumping

The action will parse the new commits since the last tag using the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) conventions.

semantic-release uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, semantic-release automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number.

By default semantic-release uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

Here is an example of the release type that will be done based on a commit messages:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Commit message </td> <td> Release type </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```
```

</td>
<td>Patch Release</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```
```

</td>
<td>Minor Release</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```
```

</td>
<td>Major Release</td>
</tr>
</table>

If no commit message contains any information, then **default_bump** will be used.

\xe2\x98\x9d\xef\xb8\x8f Here you can see the default values of all available configuration parameters, however, the only required parameter is the `GITHUB_TOKEN` one.

```yml
```

## \xf0\x9f\x8e\x9b\xef\xb8\x8f Available parameters

- `*_label` (`xs_label`, `s_label`\xe2\x80\xa6): Adjust size label names
- `*_max_size` (`xs_max_size`, `s_max_size`\xe2\x80\xa6): Adjust which amount of changes you consider appropriate for each size based on your project context
- `fail_if_xl`: Set to `\'true\'` will report GitHub Workflow failure if the PR size is xl allowing to forbid PR merge
- `message_if_xl`: Let the user(s) know that the PR exceeds the recommended size and what the consequences are
- `github_api_url`: Override this parameter in order to use with your own GitHub Enterprise Server. Example: `\'https://github.example.com/api/v3\'`
- `files_to_ignore`: Whitespace or newline separated list of files to ignore when calculating the PR size, regex match is supported.
### files_to_ignore Example: 
```yml
```
## \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94 Basic concepts or assumptions

- PR size labeler consider as a change any kind of line addition, deletion, or modification
- A PR will be labeled as `xl` if it exceeds the amount of changes defined as `l_max_size`

## Usage

### GitHub Actions

You can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-management.yml`, with the following:

```yaml
```

### GitHub App

You can also install the [Release Drafter GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter), choosing the repositories for which you want releases automatically created.

## Configuration

Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

### Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:

<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
```

## Configuration Options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

| Key                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `template`            | Required | The template for the body of the draft release. Use [template variables](#template-variables) to insert values.                                                                                                   |

Release Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.

## Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`:

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |
| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |
| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases\xe2\x80\x99s tag.                                                                                          |

## Next Version Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |
| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |
| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |

## Version Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:

| Variable | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `$PATCH` | The patch version number. |
| `$MINOR` | The minor version number. |
| `$MAJOR` | The major version number. |

## Change Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:

| Variable  | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NUMBER` | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                  |
| `$TITLE`  | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. |
| `$AUTHOR` | The pull request author\xe2\x80\x99s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.     |

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:

<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

## Exclude Pull Requests

With the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.

## Replacers

You can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.

```yml
```

## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## GitHub Installation Permissions

Release Drafter requires full write, because GitHub does not offer a limited scope for only writing releases. **Don\'t install Release Drafter to your entire GitHub account \xe2\x80\x94 only add the repositories you want to draft releases on.**

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
```

Once you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub
  - Publishes the npm release
  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)
  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes

You don\'t need to check cache hit because `-s` option for `rbenv install` does the job. You need to be aware of [cache limits](https://github.com/actions/cache#cache-limits) if you want to keep multiple rubies.

552,"# Code Climate Test Reporter Action

## Usage

Basic usage is as follows: 

```yaml
```

The action can be configured with the following inputs:

- `codeclimate-test-reporter-id`: **Required**. The test reporter ID. This is a write-only ID that can only post test reports.
- `codeclimate-test-reporter-version`: **Optional**. The test reporter version. Default is ""latest"".
- `codeclimate-test-reporter-url`: **Optional**. The test reporter download URL. If supplied, it will override the version input.
- `command`: **Optional**. The command to execute using the code climate test reporter. Default is ""after-build"".


You can also supply additional command line arguments via the same `command` 
input.

    - name: Send code coverage report
      uses: aktions/codeclimate-test-reporter@v1
      with:

553,"# setup-rbenv

Setup Ruby by [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) on Linux, not using tool-cache provided by GitHub to catch up the latest versions of Ruby.

# Usage

You need to initialize rbenv by dispatching `eval ""$(rbenv init -)""` in each step before you run Ruby.

```yaml
```

## Cache

By using [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache), you can keep your rubies in your cache.

```yaml
```

You don\'t need to check cache hit because `-s` option for `rbenv install` does the job. You need to be aware of [cache limits](https://github.com/actions/cache#cache-limits) if you want to keep multiple rubies.

554,"# GitHub Action for Dispatching Workflows

This action triggers another GitHub Actions workflow, using the `workflow_dispatch` event.  
The workflow must be configured for this event type e.g. `on: [workflow_dispatch]`

This allows you to chain workflows, the classic use case is have a CI build workflow, trigger a CD release/deploy workflow when it completes. Allowing you to maintain separate workflows for CI and CD, and pass data between them as required.

For details of the `workflow_dispatch` even see [this blog post introducing this type of trigger](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/)

*Note 1.* GitHub now has a native way to chain workflows called ""reusable workflows"". See the docs on [reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows). This approach is somewhat different from workflow_dispatch but it\'s worth keeping in mind.

*Note 2.* The GitHub UI will report flows triggered by this action as ""manually triggered"" even though they have been run programmatically via another workflow and the API.

*Note 3.* If you want to reference the target workflow by ID, you will need to list them with the following REST API call `curl https://api.github.com/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/actions/workflows -H ""Authorization: token {{pat-token}}""`

## Action Inputs

### `workflow`
**Required.** The name, filename or ID of the workflow to be triggered and run. All three possibilities are used when looking for the workflow. e.g.

```yaml
```

### `inputs`
**Optional.** The inputs to pass to the workflow (if any are configured), this must be a JSON encoded string, e.g. `{ ""myInput"": ""foobar"" }`

### `ref`
**Optional.** The Git reference used with the triggered workflow run. The reference can be a branch, tag, or a commit SHA. If omitted the context ref of the triggering workflow is used. If you want to trigger on pull requests and run the target workflow in the context of the pull request branch, set the ref to `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`. 

### `repo`
**Optional.** The default behavior is to trigger workflows in the same repo as the triggering workflow, if you wish to trigger in another GitHub repo ""externally"", then provide the owner + repo name with slash between them e.g. `microsoft/vscode`.

- When triggering across repos like this, you **must** provide a `token` (see below), or you will get an *""Resource not accessible by integration""* error.
- If the default branch in the other repo is different from the calling repo, you must provide `ref` input also, or you will get a *""No ref found""* error.

### `token`
**Optional.** By default the standard `github.token`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used and you no longer need to provide your own token here. However when using the `repo` option, you must provide a token here, create a PAT token with repo rights, and pass it here via a secret. This options is also left for backwards compatibility reasons.

This Action emits a single output named `workflowId`.

## Overview

This action supports every github event. Currently the app publish default messages to twitter when one of these GitHub events will trigger: 
* push
* pull_request
* release <br />   

Here you can see default messages: [Default messages](#default-messages)

## Motivation

I am using this project to hone my coding skills. I have some but they are not the greatest. I believe that with help of my brother/mentor :heart_eyes:, this project could be a stepping stone towards my new career.

## What do you need?
>  :exclamation: For this paragraph I would like to thank https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together. Amazing job :sparkles: I learned a lot :chart_with_upwards_trend:

[Create a twitter](docs/setup.md) app with your shared twitter account and store the credentials as `TWITTER_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` in your repository\xe2\x80\x99s secrets settings.

> :boom: Hopefully in the future people will be copying my code :pray:

## Example usage

> :exclamation: Make sure to replace {VERSION} with the version of the action that you wish to use.

### push event

```sh
```

### pull_request event

```sh
```

### release event

```sh
```

### Without custom message

```sh
```

### Default messages
```sh
```

### Custom message

To create a custom twitter post I used these two websites:

* https://lingojam.com/TwitterFonts 
* https://www.piliapp.com/twitter-symbols/

Go nuts and make it as sparkly as you like (just remember about twitter character limitations https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters).

562,"# WordPress.org Plugin Deploy - ***Github Action***
This Action commits the contents of your Git tag to the WordPress.org plugin repository using the same tag name. 
It excludes Git-specific items or files and directories as optionally defined in your `.wporgignore` file, and 
moves anything from a `.wordpress-org` subdirectory to the top-level `assets` directory in Subversion (plugin banners, icons, and screenshots).

## Configuration
### Required secrets
* `WORDPRESS_USERNAME`
* `WORDPRESS_PASSWORD`
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` - you do not need to generate one but you do have to explicitly make it available to the Action

Secrets can be set while editing your workflow or in the repository settings. They cannot be viewed once stored. [GitHub secrets documentation](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets/)

### Optional environment variables
* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug. This should be a very rare case as WordPress assumes that the directory and initial plugin file have the same slug.
* `VERSION` - defaults to the tag name; do not recommend setting this except for testing purposes
* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`)
* `IGNORE_FILE` - defaults to `.wporgignore`, customizable for other locations of list of files to be ignore like `.gitignore`
* `ASSETS_IGNORE_FILE` - defaults to `.wporgassetsignore`, customizable for other locations of list of files to be ignore like `.gitignore`
* `DIST_LOCATION` - defaults to `./dist/`, option to save final zip files.

### Excluding files from deployment
If there are files or directories to be excluded from deployment, such as tests or editor config files, they can be specified in your `.wporgignore` file. If you use this method, please be sure to include the following items:

```gitignore
```

![Tests](https://github.com/patrickjahns/version-drafter-action/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?event=push)

[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) designed as companion for [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to determine the next [semantic version](https://semver.org/) based  on the github labels of merged pull requests


## Usage

To use the action, create a yaml file ( i.e. `version.yml` ) in your `.github/workflows` folder 

### Standalone example

```yaml
```
 
### With release-drafter

```yaml
```

### Configuration

The action determines the next semantic version based on github labels. The mapping of the labels can be configured by
providing a yaml configuration (usually at `.github/version-drafter.yml`)

```yaml
```

### Output

The action will output the calculated next semantic version as `next-version`, as well as the current tag as `current-version`","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON and XML processor. `yq` uses [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json, xml, properties, csv and tsv. It doesn\'t yet support everything `jq` does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.

yq is written in go - so you can download a dependency free binary for your platform and you are good to go! If you prefer there are a variety of package managers that can be used as well as Docker and Podman, all listed below.

## Quick Usage Guide

Read a value:
```bash
```

Pipe from STDIN:
```bash
```

Update a yaml file, inplace
```bash
```

Update using environment variables
```bash
```

Merge multiple files
```bash
```

Multiple updates to a yaml file
```bash
```

Convert JSON to YAML
```bash
```

See the [documentation](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) for more examples.

Take a look at the discussions for [common questions](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/discussions/categories/q-a), and [cool ideas](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)

## Install

### [Download the latest binary](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest)

### wget
Use wget to download, gzipped pre-compiled binaries:


For instance, VERSION=v4.2.0 and BINARY=yq_linux_amd64

#### Compressed via tar.gz
```bash
```

#### Plain binary

```bash
```

#### Latest version

```bash
```

### MacOS / Linux via Homebrew:
Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
```

### Linux via snap:
```
```

#### Snap notes
`yq` installs with [_strict confinement_](https://docs.snapcraft.io/snap-confinement/6233) in snap, this means it doesn\'t have direct access to root files. To read root files you can:

```
```

And to write to a root file you can either use [sponge](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge):
```
```
or write to a temporary file:
```
```

### Run with Docker or Podman
#### Oneshot use:

```bash
```

Note that you can run `yq` in docker without network access and other privileges if you desire,
namely `--security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop all --network none`.

```bash
```

#### Pipe in via STDIN:

You\'ll need to pass the `-i\\--interactive` flag to docker:

```bash
```

```bash
```

#### Run commands interactively:

```bash
```

```bash
```

It can be useful to have a bash function to avoid typing the whole docker command:

```bash
```

```bash
```
#### Running as root:

`yq`\'s container image no longer runs under root (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/pull/860). If you\'d like to install more things in the container image, or you\'re having permissions issues when attempting to read/write files you\'ll need to either:


```
```

```
```

Or, in your Dockerfile:

```
```

#### Missing timezone data
By default, the alpine image yq uses does not include timezone data. If you\'d like to use the `tz` operator, you\'ll need to include this data:

```
```

#### Podman with SELinux

If you are using podman with SELinux, you will need to set the shared volume flag `:z` on the volume mount:

```
```

## Known Issues / Missing Features
- `yq` attempts to preserve comment positions and whitespace as much as possible, but it does not handle all scenarios (see https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v3 for details)
- Powershell has its own...[opinions on quoting yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/usage/tips-and-tricks#quotes-in-windows-powershell)
- ""yes"", ""no"" were dropped as boolean values in the yaml 1.2 standard - which is the standard yq assumes.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

In many cases, you need to do nothing. Just use `reviewdog/action-golangci-lint@v2` instead of `reviewdog/action-golangci-lint@v1`.

If your workflow have steps for setting up Go and caching go modules, they are no longer needed.
`reviewdog/action-golangci-lint@v2` now set up Go and cache modules automatically, so remove these steps.

```yaml
```

## Inputs

### `github_token`

**Required**. Default is `${{ github.token }}`.

### `golangci_lint_flags`

Optional. golangci-lint flags. (golangci-lint run --out-format=line-number
`<golangci_lint_flags>`)

Note that you can change golangci-lint behavior by [configuration
file](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#configuration) too.

### `tool_name`

Optional. Tool name to use for reviewdog reporter. Useful when running multiple
actions with different config.

### `level`

Optional. Report level for reviewdog [info,warning,error].
It\'s same as `-level` flag of reviewdog.

### `workdir`

Optional. Working directory relative to the root directory.

### `reporter`

Optional. Reporter of reviewdog command [github-pr-check,github-pr-review].
It\'s same as `-reporter` flag of reviewdog.

### `filter_mode`

Optional. Filtering mode for the reviewdog command [added,diff_context,file,nofilter].
Default is added.

### `fail_on_error`

Optional. Exit code for reviewdog when errors are found [`true`, `false`]
Default is `false`.

[![Preview](https://serhiy.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Github_repo/gcloud/logo_gcp_vertical_rgb.png?v=1)](https://cloud.google.com)

GitHub Action which allows interacting with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

## Usage

To use gcloud in your workflow use:

```yaml
```

You can also use `gsutil` from Google Cloud SDK package.

```yaml
```

You can also use `kubectl` from Google Cloud SDK package.

```yaml
```

### Secrets

`APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - To authorize in GCP you need to have a [service account key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).
The recommended way to store the credentials in the secrets it previously encode file with base64. To encode a JSON file use: `base64 ~/<account_id>.json`. Or you can put a JSON structure to the secret.

`PROJECT_ID` - must be provided to activate a specific project.

### Using access tokens

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` to a valid OAUTH token; this allows the step to be used with [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions).

```yaml
```

Two important notes:

1. If `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set, it will override any other auth configuration
2. The `gsutil` command does not support the `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable; use [gcloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/storage) to interact with GCS.

### Inputs

`args` - command to run.

`cli` - (optional) command line tool you want to use. Defaults to `gcloud`, allowed values: `gcloud`, `gsutil`.

### Version
For each new release of gcloud master branch is updated to the latest version. Also, the tag is creating with the same number as the gcloud version. If you want to always have the latest version of gcloud, use `@master` branch. 
But if you need some specific version of gcloud just use a specific tag. For example `@271.0.0`.

## Example
### Latest version
```yaml

### Multistep

GitHub has a new way to publish a static site to Pages using GitHub Actions. This means you can now build with the Jekyll command (or something else) and use actions to publish, all using regular steps. 
This removes the need for Docker based actions and gives you all the freedom to configure the execution environment (versions of Ruby, extra dependencies...), it is a lot faster, easier to debug and closer to what you can run on your local machine. 

You can check [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)
for more information on how to do this. 

Maintaining this action was a great experience, but as there is now a better solution availabe I do encourage everyone to move over. 


# jekyll-action
A GitHub Action to build and publish Jekyll sites to GitHub Pages

Out-of-the-box Jekyll with GitHub Pages allows you to leverage a limited, white-listed, set of gems. Complex sites requiring custom ones or non white-listed ones (AsciiDoc for instance) used to require a continuous integration build in order to pre-process the site.

Remember that GitHub is serving your built static site, not its sources. So when configuring GitHub Pages in your project settings, use **gh-pages branch** as a Source for GitHub Pages. If you are setting up *username*.github.io repository, you\'ll have to use **master branch**, so sources can be located in another orphaned branch in the repo (which you can safely mark as default after the first publication).
In addition to that default behaviour, you can configure the branch this plugin pushes into with the `target_branch`-option. Keep in mind to set the source branch accordingly at the GitHub Pages Settings page.

Note that this is a rather simple (naive maybe) Docker based action. @limjh16 has created [a JS based version of this action](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts) which saves the container download time and might help with non default use cases (such as but not limited to: specific package or library that is not available as a Gem).

## Usage

### Create a Jekyll site
If your repo doesn\'t already have one, create a new Jekyll site:  `jekyll new sample-site`. See [the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information. In this repo, we have created a site within a `sample_site` folder within the repository because the repository\'s main goal is not to be a website. If it was the case, we would have created the site at the root of the repository.

### Create a `Gemfile`
As you are using this action to leverage specific Gems, well, you need to declare them! In the sample below we are using [the Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc)

```Ruby
```

### Configure your Jekyll site
Edit the configuration file of your Jekyll site (`_config.yml`) to leverage these plugins. In our sample, we want to leverage AsciiDoc so we added the following section:

```yaml
```

Note that we also renamed `index.html` to `index.adoc` and modified this file accordingly in order to leverage AsciiDoc.

### Create your publishing target
The historical default behavior of GitHub Pages is to deploy the content of a `gh-pages` branch. If you want to rely on this and you don\'t have such a branch yet, you can create it with the following instructions 

```
```

### Use the action
Use the `helaili/jekyll-action@master` action in your workflow file. It needs access to the out-of-the-box `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The directory where the Jekyll site lives will be detected (based on the location of `_config.yml`) but you can also explicitly set this directory by setting the `jekyll_src` parameter (`sample_site` for us). The `SRC` environment variable is also supported for backward compatibilty but it is deprecated.
The action will search for Gemfile location. If your want to specify it explicitly (e.g. if you have multiple Gemfiles per project), you should update `gem_src` input parameter accordingly.

Use the `actions/cache` action in the workflow as well, to shorten build times and decrease load on GitHub\'s servers

```yaml
```

Upon successful execution, the GitHub Pages publishing will happen automatically and will be listed on the *_environment_* tab of your repository.

Just click on the *_View deployment_* button of the `github-pages` environment to navigate to your GitHub Pages site.

The Jekyll environment to build (default to `production`)

### jekyll_src
The Jekyll website source directory

### jekyll_build_options
Additional Jekyll build arguments (see [the Jekyll doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#build-command-options))

### gem_src
The Jekyll Gemfile directory

### target_branch
The target branch name the sources get pushed to

### target_path:
The relative path where the site gets pushed to

### build_only
When set to `true`, the Jekyll site will be built but not published

### build_dir
This is the directory which you want to build your site in

### pre_build_commands
Commands to run prior to build and deploy. Useful for ensuring build dependencies are up to date or installing new dependencies. For example, use `apk --update add imagemagick` to install ImageMagick.

### keep_history 
When set to `true`, previous version of the site will be restored before the Jekyll build takes place. You can then use [the `keep_files` option](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#global-configuration) in your `_config.yml` file to select the files you want to keep. Make sure you then keep at least the `.git` folder. This option will also remove the `--force` flag from the `git commit...` command.  

```yml
```

### bundler_version
When set override the default bundler version provided. If not given will attempt to resolve bundler version from `Gemfile.lock` if one exists.

### commit_author
When set override the default author of the commits to be performed. The default is to use the `GITHUB_ACTOR` environment variable, which is usually the owner of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The value can for example be set to `github-actions[bot]`. The corresponding email address is automatically set to `[commit_author]@users.noreply.github.com`.

## Use case: multi version publishing 

Say you want to create a documentation website where you both have the current version (`v3.0`), but also `v1.0` and `v2.0`. You can then use a combination of `keep_history` and `target_path` along with the `actions/checkout@v2`action so that each version gets pushed in a separate folder without overwritting the previous one. 

```yaml 
```

## Deprecation
This action previously used a `JEKYLL_PAT` environment variable instead of the `token` parameter. This is now deprecated. 

## I have a problem
Create a `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret with value `true` and run the workflow again. 

## Note on custom domains
If you\'re using a Custom Domain for your GitHub Pages site, you will need to ensure that the `CNAME` file exists in the repository root of the `main` (or `master`) branch so that it can be copied to the deployment root when your site is deployed.

If your GitHub Pages site is run off the `main` (or `master`) branch, you can modify the Custom Domain setting in the Repository Settings to automatically generate and commit the `CNAME` file.

If your GitHub Pages site is run off an _alternate_ branch, however, you will need to manually create and commit the `CNAME` file with your custom domain as its contents, otherwise the file will be committed to the deployment branch and _overwritten the next time the action is run_.

Note that you can [force the inclusion of your CNAME file](https://github.com/criptowiki/criptowiki/issues/15#issuecomment-886890153)

574,"A Github Action that I use to deploy my django apps with docker.

Some bits are hard-coded for my setup so I don\'t recommend using this
directly, but you could certainly fork it and set it up for your environment.

Github secrets that need to be set:

* `WEB_HOSTS` - space separated list of web app servers.
* `CELERY_HOSTS` - (optional) space separated list of hosts running a celery worker
* `BEAT_HOSTS` - (optional) space separated list of hosts running a celery beat worker
* `PRIVATE_KEY` - ssh private key. obviously, you\'ll need the
  corresponding public key on every server you want to connect to and
  it should be passphrase-less.
* `KNOWN_HOSTS` - contents of an ssh `known_hosts` file. Generate it
  by doing something like `ssh-keyscan -t rsa $HOST >> known_hosts`
  for every host that you are going to connect to. Then paste the
  contents of that file into the Github secret field.

Other Environment variables:

* `SSH_USER` - user to ssh as. This user will need password-less
  `sudo` access on the server for the appropriate `systemctl` commands
  and permissions to interact with docker.
* `APP` - the app it\'s building/deploying.

```

If not specified, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used by default.

## Enable auto-author-assign for the issues

An issue author can be automatically assigned as an issue assignee.

- Add `issues` to the trigger
- Add `issues: write` to the permissions

```yml
```

## Skip assigning author

577,"# Post Slack messages

This action wraps the Slack [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API method for posting to channels, private groups, and DMs. This action sends messages using [Slack bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types), which have two main advantages compared to user tokens and incoming webhooks: (1) Bots can\'t be disabled inadvertently when a Slack user is disabled or removed. Slack has written about this in a [recent announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-latest-with-app-tokens-fe878d44130c), and (2) Bots offer a [powerful range of capabilities](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) that can be leveraged to perform more functions.

## Usage:

```yaml
```

Here\'s what the Slack message would look like:

<img src=""docs/images/slack-message-example.png"" width=""540"">

## Setup

To use this GitHub Action you\'ll first need to create a Slack App and install it to your Slack workspace.

### Creating a Slack App

1. **Create a Slack App**. Go to [Slack\'s developer site](https://api.slack.com/apps) then click ""Create an app"". Name the app ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and make sure your team\'s Slack workspace is selected under ""Development Slack Workspace"" ([see screenshot](docs/images/slack-app.png)).
2. **Add a Bot user**. Browse to the ""Bot users"" page listed in the sidebar. Name your bot ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and leave the other default settings as-is ([see screenshot](docs/images/bot-user.png)).
3. **Set an icon for your bot.** Browse to the ""Basic information"" page listed in the sidebar. Scroll down to the section titled ""Display information"" to set an icon. Feel free to use one of the [icons in this repository](docs/app-icons).
4. **Install your app to your workspace.** At the top of the ""Basic information"" page you can find a section titled ""Install your app to your workspace"". Click on it, then use the button to complete the installation ([see screenshot](docs/images/install-slack-app.png)).

## Using the action

To use this GitHub Action, you\'ll need to set a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secret on GitHub. To get your Slack bot token, browse to the ""OAuth & Permissions"" page listed in Slack and copy the ""Bot User OAuth Access Token"" beginning in `xoxb-`.

### Posting messages

Slack\'s [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) method accepts a JSON payload containing options \xe2\x80\x94 this JSON payload should be supplied as the argument in your GitHub Action. At a bare minimum, your payload must include a channel ID and the message. Here\'s what a basic message might look like:

```yaml
```

Please note that if you are using the visual editor you should not escape quotes because GitHub will automatically escape them for you.

#### Channel IDs

A ""channel ID"" can be the ID of a channel, private group, or user you would like to post a message to. Your bot can message any user in your Slack workspace but needs to be invited into channels and private groups before it can post to them.

If you open Slack in your web browser, you can find channel IDs at the end of the URL when viewing channels and private groups. Note that this doesn\'t work for direct messages.

```
```

You can also find channel IDs using the Slack API. Get a list of channels that your bot is a member of via Slack\'s [users.conversations](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.conversations) endpoint. Get user IDs for direct messages using Slack\'s [users.lookupByEmail](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.lookupByEmail) endpoint

If the channel is private, you\'ll need to install the App in that channel.

#### Formatting messages

Please refer to [Slack\'s documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages) on message formatting. They also have a [message builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) that\'s great for playing around and previewing messages. Your messages can contain attachments, markdown, buttons, and more.

581,"# Jekyll Builder for GitHub Pages (Action)

Fast and simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) based on the official [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/jekyll/docker) `builder` image for building a Jekyll site and optionally deploying that site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* **Lightweight for fast builds.** The action\'s container image weighs in at ~80MB smaller than many comparable others.
* **Minimal configuration.** Smart defaults are automatically pulled from your GitHub account via the [GitHub v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
* **Observable and debug-able**. Clear logs with plenty of hints for what to do when a commit breaks the build. Debug the action itself just by running it with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `""true""`.
* **Batteries included**. Based on the official `jekyll/builder` Docker image so dependencies are always there when you need them.
* **Automatic updates**. Never update your pipeline manually if you don\'t want to. If you do, specify a version-pinned ref in your workflow for guaranteed stability.
* **Highlighy customizable**. Run custom commands before or after your build to easily smooth over any edge cases.
* **Pipeline-ready.** Safe for Continuous Delivery workflows because only real issues, not no-ops, cause build errors. 

This Action was created to be fast, simple, and versatile. It ships with smart defaults that are augmented at runtime with data pulled from the GitHub API, so you can keep your workflow file short and readable instead of spending time setting configuration inputs just to get the basics done. Use all the feautures of the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image and, if you need even more power, granting the action more privileges (by adding scopes to a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) used as the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable) will make it do more of the right things, automatically.

# Usage

In one of your [GitHub Actions workflow files](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file), add the following as [a step in a job](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):

```yaml
```

That\'s it. The action will use whatever source code is checked out from a previous [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) step as the Jekyll source to build. If the build succeeds, the step passes and the job continues with the next step.

For more details, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-actions-from-github-marketplace-in-your-workflow). For more common use cases, notably deploying to GitHub Pages, see [\xc2\xa7 Examples](#examples).

## Choosing a ref

Use the following guidance when choosing which ref (version) you want to base your work on:

* `v1` - This references the latest available 1.x.x version of the Action, which conforms with semantic versioning compatibility conventions. Use this ref in your workflow to gain backwards-compatible enhancements automatically. These versions will all be based on the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image\'s `latest` tag.
* `builder-3.8` - This reference is based on `jekyll/builder:3.8` and is considered a stable, legacy release. Use this ref in your workflow to stick to the given upstream tag.

## Inputs

You can customize this action by [using input variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).  Moreover,  *all inputs are optional*, so the action will still build your Jekyll site without any additional configuration. To enable deployments to GitHub Pages and other advanced features, some inputs are required as described below.

For additional details, inputs are well-commented in [the action\'s metadata file (`action.yaml`)](action.yaml).

### `gh_pages_publishing_source`

Name of the branch your repository is using as its GitHub Pages publishing source. This is the branch in your GitHub repository to which the Action will commit the result of the Jekyll build. Note that to deploy on GitHub Pages, you *must* first enable GitHub Pages from your repository\'s Settings screen and choose a GitHub Pages publishing source branch before using this Action.

When GitHub Pages is enabled, User and Organization repositories reserve the `master` branch as the GitHub Pages publishing source. This means you *must not* keep your own source code files in the `master` branch of User or Organization repositories when using this Action to automate deployments to GitHub Pages.

By default, this value is detected automatically if you have already [configured a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) in your repository settings and provided a [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable with appropriate permissions.

This option is ignored when the Action detects a [User or Organization repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites), because those types of GitHub Pages sites can only ever use their `master` branch as a publishing source. For Project repositories, this defaults to the value set in your repository\'s Settings screen (e.g., `gh-pages` branch).

### `git_commit_message`

When a commit to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch ([`gh_pages_publishing_source`](#gh_pages_publishing_source)) is made, this input variable defines the message to use. If none is specified, a generic default message will be used.

### `git_committer_email`

The email address to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the email associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow if the access token passed as the [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable has permission to access that data. If not, it will default to `""${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com""`.

### `git_committer_name`

The name to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the display name associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow.

### `jekyll_build_opts`

Extra arguments to pass to [the `jekyll build` command](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). This is particularly useful if your site requires non-default Jekyll build behaviors to be enabled. For example, to publish future-dated posts on your blog:

```yaml
```

See the output of `jekyll build --help` for more options.

### `pre_build_commands`

Set this input variable to a shell command or short inline shell script, which will be executed prior to the build. This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.

For example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.

```yaml
```

A more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):

```yaml
```

### `post_build_commands`

Exactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.

### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`

Set this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.

You should always set this input variable by using the `secrets` expression context provided by GitHub Actions runners:

```yaml
```

For more information, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

## Outputs

> :construction: TODO

The current version of this action does not produce any outputs. Hopefully, a future version will. :)

## Examples

This section offers some complete workflow examples to show you how to make use of this action.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

By default, when the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable is set, the action will deploy the Jekyll build to the GitHub Pages publishing source branch configured in your repository\'s GitHub Pages Settings section. This means you must first [configure a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) before using this action to deploy a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.

This input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token). Then navigate to your repository\'s Settings &rarr; Secrets screen and add a new secret whose value is exactly the same as the personal access token you created moments earlier. In the example configuration below, we assume you have created a repository secret named `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`.

```yaml
```

Using the above workflow file, anytime someone with the appropriate permissions pushes to the `jekyll` branch in your repository, this action will run. The `build-and-publish` job will `git checkout` the `jekyll` branch source code, which should contain your Jekyll site\'s source (not your generated HTML). Assuming the secret `GH_PAGES_TOKEN` contains a personal access token granted the sufficient permissions, the action will automatically detect the correct branch to `git commit` and `git push` your generated HTML to.

#### Automatically rebuilding a GitHub Pages site

You can schedule your workflow to run this action in order to keep your (otherwise static) GitHub Pages site content fresh This is particularly useful if your Jekyll templates show different content based on the date or time of the build, such as featuring your organization\'s next calendar event on the site\'s home page. Enable scheduled builds by adding a `schedule` key in the `on` dictionary from the above example:

```yaml
```

See [Events that trigger workflows \xc2\xa7 Scheduled events: `schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) for more information.

582,"# Jekyll Builder for GitHub Pages (Action)

Fast and simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) based on the official [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/jekyll/docker) `builder` image for building a Jekyll site and optionally deploying that site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* **Lightweight for fast builds.** The action\'s container image weighs in at ~80MB smaller than many comparable others.
* **Minimal configuration.** Smart defaults are automatically pulled from your GitHub account via the [GitHub v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
* **Observable and debug-able**. Clear logs with plenty of hints for what to do when a commit breaks the build. Debug the action itself just by running it with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `""true""`.
* **Batteries included**. Based on the official `jekyll/builder` Docker image so dependencies are always there when you need them.
* **Automatic updates**. Never update your pipeline manually if you don\'t want to. If you do, specify a version-pinned ref in your workflow for guaranteed stability.
* **Highlighy customizable**. Run custom commands before or after your build to easily smooth over any edge cases.
* **Pipeline-ready.** Safe for Continuous Delivery workflows because only real issues, not no-ops, cause build errors. 

This Action was created to be fast, simple, and versatile. It ships with smart defaults that are augmented at runtime with data pulled from the GitHub API, so you can keep your workflow file short and readable instead of spending time setting configuration inputs just to get the basics done. Use all the feautures of the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image and, if you need even more power, granting the action more privileges (by adding scopes to a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) used as the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable) will make it do more of the right things, automatically.

# Usage

In one of your [GitHub Actions workflow files](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file), add the following as [a step in a job](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):

```yaml
```

That\'s it. The action will use whatever source code is checked out from a previous [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) step as the Jekyll source to build. If the build succeeds, the step passes and the job continues with the next step.

For more details, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-actions-from-github-marketplace-in-your-workflow). For more common use cases, notably deploying to GitHub Pages, see [\xc2\xa7 Examples](#examples).

## Choosing a ref

Use the following guidance when choosing which ref (version) you want to base your work on:

* `v1` - This references the latest available 1.x.x version of the Action, which conforms with semantic versioning compatibility conventions. Use this ref in your workflow to gain backwards-compatible enhancements automatically. These versions will all be based on the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image\'s `latest` tag.
* `builder-3.8` - This reference is based on `jekyll/builder:3.8` and is considered a stable, legacy release. Use this ref in your workflow to stick to the given upstream tag.

## Inputs

You can customize this action by [using input variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).  Moreover,  *all inputs are optional*, so the action will still build your Jekyll site without any additional configuration. To enable deployments to GitHub Pages and other advanced features, some inputs are required as described below.

For additional details, inputs are well-commented in [the action\'s metadata file (`action.yaml`)](action.yaml).

### `gh_pages_publishing_source`

Name of the branch your repository is using as its GitHub Pages publishing source. This is the branch in your GitHub repository to which the Action will commit the result of the Jekyll build. Note that to deploy on GitHub Pages, you *must* first enable GitHub Pages from your repository\'s Settings screen and choose a GitHub Pages publishing source branch before using this Action.

When GitHub Pages is enabled, User and Organization repositories reserve the `master` branch as the GitHub Pages publishing source. This means you *must not* keep your own source code files in the `master` branch of User or Organization repositories when using this Action to automate deployments to GitHub Pages.

By default, this value is detected automatically if you have already [configured a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) in your repository settings and provided a [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable with appropriate permissions.

This option is ignored when the Action detects a [User or Organization repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites), because those types of GitHub Pages sites can only ever use their `master` branch as a publishing source. For Project repositories, this defaults to the value set in your repository\'s Settings screen (e.g., `gh-pages` branch).

### `git_commit_message`

When a commit to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch ([`gh_pages_publishing_source`](#gh_pages_publishing_source)) is made, this input variable defines the message to use. If none is specified, a generic default message will be used.

### `git_committer_email`

The email address to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the email associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow if the access token passed as the [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable has permission to access that data. If not, it will default to `""${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com""`.

### `git_committer_name`

The name to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the display name associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow.

### `jekyll_build_opts`

Extra arguments to pass to [the `jekyll build` command](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). This is particularly useful if your site requires non-default Jekyll build behaviors to be enabled. For example, to publish future-dated posts on your blog:

```yaml
```

See the output of `jekyll build --help` for more options.

### `pre_build_commands`

Set this input variable to a shell command or short inline shell script, which will be executed prior to the build. This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.

For example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.

```yaml
```

A more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):

```yaml
```

### `post_build_commands`

Exactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.

### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`

Set this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.

This input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token).

585,"# cancel-previous-runs 
This action cancels previous runs for one or more branches/prs associated with a workflow, effectively limiting the resource consumption of the workflow to one per branch.

#### NOTE: This action was created before [concurrency groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency). In most cases you want to define a cancel-in-progress group instead of using this action.

<p><a href=""https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions""><img alt=""typescript-action status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage

The easiest and most complete approach to utilize this action, is to create a separate schedule event triggered workflow, which is directed at the workflow you wish to clear duplicate runs. At each cron interval all branches and all PRs executing for either push or pull_request events will be processed and limited to one run per branch/pr.

Additionally this action can be placed as an early step in your workflow (e.g. after checkout), so that it can abort the other previously running jobs immediately, in case most resources are tied up. Unfortunately this approach is a no-op when a pull request uses a fork for a source branch. This is because the GITHUB_TOKEN provided to runs with a fork source branch specifies reed-only permissions for security reasons. write permissions are required to be able to cancel a job. Therefore, it\'s a good idea to only rely on this approach as a fallback in-addition to the previously described scheduling model. 

### Inputs

token - The github token passed from `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Since workflow files are visible in the repository, **DO NOT HARDCODE A TOKEN ONLY USE A REFERENCE**. 
workflow - The filename of the workflow to limit runs on (only applies to schedule events) 


### Schedule Example

```yaml
```


### Alternate/Fallback Example

## \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94 why bother

GitHub Actions is an event-oriented system. Your workflows run in response to events and are triggered independently and without coordination. In a shared repository, if two or more people merge pull requests, each will trigger workflows without regard to one another.

This can be problematic for workflows used as part of a continuous deployment process. You might want to let an in-flight deployment complete before progressing further with the next workflow. This is the usecase turnstyle action targets.

## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb8 Usage

The typical setup for turnstyle involves adding job step using `softprops/turnstyle@v1`.

```diff
```

### Timing out

To avoid waiting prolonged periods of time, you may wish to bail on a run or continuing a workflow run regardless of the status of the previous run.

You can bail from a run using the built-in GitHub Actions [`jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) setting

```diff
```

You can also limit how long you\'re willing to wait before moving on with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.continue-after-seconds`

```diff
```

or before aborting the step with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.abort-after-seconds`


```diff
```

Finally, you can use the `force_continued` output to skip only a subset of steps
by setting `continue-after-seconds` and conditioning future steps with
`if: ! steps.<step id>.outputs.force_continued`


```diff
```

|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GITHUB_TOKEN as provided by `secrets`|

## cost of coordination

At this time there is no way to coordinate between workflow runs beyond waiting. For those using private repositories, [you are charged based on the time your workflow spends running](https://github.com/features/actions#pricing-details). Waiting within one workflow run for another to complete will incur the cost of the time spent waiting.

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/past-due/fetch-release-info/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/past-due/fetch-release-info/actions)
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/past-due/fetch-release-info/workflows/Integration%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/past-due/fetch-release-info/actions)

This is a **GitHub Action** to fetch [**GitHub Releases info**](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/) and store it as JSON files in a folder.
This action can be combined simply and freely with other actions, such as static site generators that use data files.

The next example step will fetch the [latest GitHub Release info](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-the-latest-release) for the current repository, filter its data by `filter_release_keys` and `filter_asset_keys`, and output the resulting JSON to **`./releases/latest.json`**.

```yaml
```

## Options

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f `github_token`

Specify the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to increase rate limits (not required, but strongly encouraged).

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Specify a different GitHub repository

By default, the action will query the current GitHub repository. If you\'d like query information about a different repository, set the `github_repo` option.

For example:

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Specify an explicit GitHub release

By default, the action will query the ""latest"" Release. If you\'d like query information about a different GitHub Release, set the `github_release_id` option. (See: [REST API v3: Get a single release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release))

For example:

```yaml
    github_release_id: <INSERT_VALUE_HERE> # see: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Fetch a list of all GitHub releases for a repo

If you\'d like to [list all releases for a repository](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-releases-for-a-repository), set the `fetch_release_index` option to `true`.

This will output an `index.json` file in the `output_directory` that contains a [list of all published GitHub Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-releases-for-a-repository) for the repo.

For example:

```yaml
```

### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Customize output data filtering

By default, this action filters certain personal / rapidly-changing information from the output files.

#### `filter_release_keys`
> - Description: A JSON array of strings specifying _keys_ to remove from the `release` object (https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release)
> - **Default Value:** `\'[""author""]\'`

#### `filter_asset_keys`
> - Description: A JSON array of strings specifying _keys_ to remove from each `asset` object in the `release.assets` array (https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release)
> - **Default Value:** `\'[""uploader"", ""download_count""]\'`

You can customize these properties to filter whatever keys you want by specifying a JSON array of strings.

To disable filtering, set to either `\'[]\'` or `false`.

For example:

```yaml
```

595,"# GitHub Action: Delete tag and release

## Usage
Add following step to your workflow:

```yaml
```

## Developing

You can follow these instructions to get this project cloned to your local machine and ready for development. Note that
development requires at least [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to be installed on your computer.

```shell
```

Tests can be run via:

```shell
```

Since this is a repo for a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), **every new commit that changes code must include a new bundle.** You can 
generate a new bundle via running:

```shell
```

and committing the resulting changes that will be in the `dist/` folder.

### Formatting and linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for source code formatting. You can run the lint checks by running:

```shell
```

If you have lint errors that are automatically fixable, you can fix those by running:

```shell
```

## Releasing

Releases are done by creating a new tag and pushing that tag to the repo. A new
release can be made via the following:

```shell
```

This will update the version in the `package.json`, create a new commit based off of the master branch, and create a 
new Git tag with that version that points to the new commit. Remember to use the `--follow-tags` flag when running 
`git push`! Without it, the new tag won't be pushed.

An example workflow looks like this (switch to the <kbd>`<> Edit new file`</kbd> tab when creating a new workflow and paste the code below):

```yml
```

Then to prevent PRs from being merged, enable the `WIP (action)` status check in your Settings > Branch > [Branch Name] > Protect matching branches > Require status checks to pass before merging

## Contributing

I don\'t plan to add more features to it. It\'s only 10 lines of code, a great reference action to build one that matches your needs :)

## Introduction\r
This GitHub Action starts a Redis server on the default port `6379`.\r
\r
This is useful when running tests against a Redis database.\r
\r
\r
## Usage\r
A code example says more than a 1000 words. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an exemplary GitHub Action using a Redis server in versions 4 and 5 to test a Node.js app:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using a Custom Redis Image\r
You can utilize an alternative Redis image using the `redis-image` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using Redis on a Custom Port\r
You can start the Redis instance on a custom port using the `redis-port` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using a Custom Container Name\r
This GitHub Action provides a Redis Docker container. The default container name is `redis`. It can be helpful to customize the container name. For example, when running multiple Redis instances in parallel. You can customize the container name using the `redis-container-name` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
### Remove container when exit\r
Starting in v1.6.0, when running this action on a self-hosted runner, it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to remove the container so its name won\xe2\x80\x99t conflict:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r

605,"# Keep A Changelog - New Release

This GitHub action will update your CHANGELOG.md for a new release:

- Changes the \'unreleased\' section to the new version
- Updates the links to the tags at the end of the file
- Inserts a new \'unreleased\' section at the top

Here is a diff from one of the [test cases](./__tests__/fixtures/standard):

```diff
```

## Usage

Within a workflow, you can use it like this:

```yaml
```

The action will do nothing else apart from modifying the changelog.
It neither creates a commit, nor does it push anything to anywhere.
You will have to do that as part of your workflow if you need this behaviour.

Does what it says on the tin - creates a pull request, nothing else.

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Advanced usage

To get an idea of all inputs that are supported, have a look at [this file](./src/getInputs.ts) or the [tests](./__tests__/getInputs.test.ts).

For self-hosted runners behind a corporate proxy, set the https_proxy environment variable.

```yaml
```

### Action outputs

The following outputs can be set by action

- `number` - Number of the created pull request.
- `html_url` - URL of the created pull request.
- `created` - \'true\' if pull request was successfully created, \'false\' if pull request existed already.

<a href=""https://github.com/mindsers/changelog-reader-action""><img alt=""changelog-reader-action status"" src=""https://github.com/mindsers/changelog-reader-action/workflows/units-test/badge.svg""></a>

A GitHub action to read and get data from the `CHANGELOG.md` file :rocket:

**This action only works if your `CHANGELOG.md` file follows the [_Keep a Changelog_](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog) standard for now.**

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

- `path`: The path the action can find the CHANGELOG. Optional. Defaults to `./CHANGELOG.md`.
- `version`: The [exact version](https://semver.org) of the log entry you want to retreive or ""Unreleased"" for the unreleased entry. Optional. Defaults to the last version number.
- `validation_level`: Specifies at which level the validation system is set. Can be \'none\', \'warn\', \'error\'. Optional. Defaults to `none`.
- `validation_depth`: Specifies how many entries to validate in the CHANGELOG.md file. Optional. Defaults to `0`.

### Outputs

- `version`: Version of the log entry found. Ex: `2.0.0`.
- `date`: Release date of the log entry found. Ex: `2020-08-22`.
- `status`: Status of the log entry found (`prereleased`, `released`, `unreleased`, or `yanked`).
- `changes`: Description text of the log entry found.

### Validation / Linting

A validation engine is available in _Changelog Reader_. It is by default disabled but can be enabled by setting `validation_level` at \'warn\' or \'error\'.

The validation engine will enforce [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) standards as well as [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) standards and formatting. **If your project doesn\'t follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 or Keep a Changelog, do not enable the validation engine.** It might your build unnecessarily.

You can utilize the `validation_depth` input param to specify how many entries to validate. Changelog Reader will by default validates only the last 10 changelog entries.

When `validation_level` is set at \'warn\', Changelog Reader will print check results as warnings in your logs without breaking your build.
When `validation_level` is set at \'error\', Changelog Reader will print check results as errors in your logs and will throw an error to prevent the build to go further.

### Example workflow - create a release from changelog

On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) using the CHANGELOG.md content.
This Workflow example assumes you\'ll use the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) Action to create the release step:

```yaml
```

608,"# Cache action

This action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.

>Two other actions are available in addition to the primary `cache` action:
>* [Restore action](./restore/README.md)
>* [Save action](./save/README.md)

[![Tests](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)

## Documentation

See [""Caching dependencies to speed up workflows""](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).

## What\'s New

### v3

* Added support for caching in GHES 3.5+.
* Fixed download issue for files > 2GB during restore.
* Updated the minimum runner version support from node 12 -> node 16.
* Fixed avoiding empty cache save when no files are available for caching.
* Fixed tar creation error while trying to create tar with path as `~/` home folder on `ubuntu-latest`.
* Fixed zstd failing on amazon linux 2.0 runners.
* Fixed cache not working with github workspace directory or current directory.
* Fixed the download stuck problem by introducing a timeout of 1 hour for cache downloads.
* Fix zstd not working for windows on gnu tar in issues.
* Allowing users to provide a custom timeout as input for aborting download of a cache segment using an environment variable `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS`. Default is 10 minutes.
* New actions are available for granular control over caches - [restore](restore/action.yml) and [save](save/action.yml).
* Support cross-os caching as an opt-in feature. See [Cross OS caching](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) for more info.
* Added option to fail job on cache miss. See [Exit workflow on cache miss](./restore/README.md#exit-workflow-on-cache-miss) for more info.
* Fix zstd not being used after zstd version upgrade to 1.5.4 on hosted runners
* Added option to lookup cache without downloading it.
* Reduced segment size to 128MB and segment timeout to 10 minutes to fail fast in case the cache download is stuck.

See the [v2 README.md](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/v2/README.md) for older updates.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repository\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-cache-workflow) is available below. For more information, see the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

If you are using this inside a container, a POSIX-compliant `tar` needs to be included and accessible from the execution path.

If you are using a `self-hosted` Windows runner, `GNU tar` and `zstd` are required for [Cross-OS caching](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) to work. They are also recommended to be installed in general so the performance is on par with `hosted` Windows runners.

### Inputs

* `key` - An explicit key for a cache entry. See [creating a cache key](#creating-a-cache-key).
* `path` - A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore. See [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns.
* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of prefix-matched keys to use for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key.
* `enableCrossOsArchive` - An optional boolean when enabled, allows Windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms. Default: `false`
* `fail-on-cache-miss` - Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found. Default: `false`
* `lookup-only` - If true, only checks if cache entry exists and skips download. Does not change save cache behavior. Default: `false`

#### Environment Variables

* `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS` - Segment download timeout (in minutes, default `10`) to abort download of the segment if not completed in the defined number of minutes. [Read more](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)

### Outputs

* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key.

    > **Note** `cache-hit` will only be set to `true` when a cache hit occurs for the exact `key` match. For a partial key match via `restore-keys` or a cache miss, it will be set to `false`.

See [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output

### Cache scopes

The cache is scoped to the key, [version](#cache-version), and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches.

See [Matching a cache key](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key) for more info.

### Example cache workflow

#### Restoring and saving cache using a single action

```yaml
```

The `cache` action provides a `cache-hit` output which is set to `true` when the cache is restored using the primary `key` and `false` when the cache is restored using `restore-keys` or no cache is restored.

#### Using a combination of restore and save actions

```yaml
```

> **Note**
> You must use the `cache` or `restore` action in your workflow before you need to use the files that might be restored from the cache. If the provided `key` matches an existing cache, a new cache is not created and if the provided `key` doesn\'t match an existing cache, a new cache is automatically created provided the job completes successfully.

## Caching Strategies

With the introduction of the `restore` and `save` actions, a lot of caching use cases can now be achieved. Please see the [caching strategies](./caching-strategies.md) document for understanding how you can use the actions strategically to achieve the desired goal.

## Implementation Examples

Every programming language and framework has its own way of caching.

See [Examples](examples.md) for a list of `actions/cache` implementations for use with:

* [C# - NuGet](./examples.md#c---nuget)
* [Clojure - Lein Deps](./examples.md#clojure---lein-deps)

## Creating a cache key

A cache key can include any of the contexts, functions, literals, and operators supported by GitHub Actions.

For example, using the [`hashFiles`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#hashfiles) function allows you to create a new cache when dependencies change.

```yaml
```

Additionally, you can use arbitrary command output in a cache key, such as a date or software version:

```yaml
```

See [Using contexts to create cache keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#using-contexts-to-create-cache-keys)

## Cache Limits

A repository can have up to 10GB of caches. Once the 10GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.

## Skipping steps based on cache-hit

Using the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.  It is recommended to install missing/updated dependencies in case of a partial key match when the key is dependent on the `hash` of the package file.

Example:

```yaml
```

> **Note** The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)

## Cache Version

Cache version is a hash [generated](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/500d0b42fee2552ae9eeb5933091fe2fbf14e72d/packages/cache/src/internal/cacheHttpClient.ts#L73-L90) for a combination of compression tool used (Gzip, Zstd, etc. based on the runner OS) and the `path` of directories being cached. If two caches have different versions, they are identified as unique caches while matching. This, for example, means that a cache created on a `windows-latest` runner can\'t be restored on `ubuntu-latest` as cache `Version`s are different.

> Pro tip: The [list caches](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache#list-github-actions-caches-for-a-repository) API can be used to get the version of a cache. This can be helpful to troubleshoot cache miss due to version.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
The workflow will create 3 unique caches with same keys. Ubuntu and windows runners will use different compression technique and hence create two different caches. And `build-linux` will create two different caches as the `paths` are different.

```yaml
```

</details>

## Known practices and workarounds

There are a number of community practices/workarounds to fulfill specific requirements. You may choose to use them if they suit your use case. Note these are not necessarily the only solution or even a recommended solution.

* [Cache segment restore timeout](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)
* [Update a cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#update-a-cache)
* [Use cache across feature branches](./tips-and-workarounds.md#use-cache-across-feature-branches)
* [Cross OS cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache)
* [Force deletion of caches overriding default cache eviction policy](./tips-and-workarounds.md#force-deletion-of-caches-overriding-default-cache-eviction-policy)

### Windows environment variables

Please note that Windows environment variables (like `%LocalAppData%`) will NOT be expanded by this action. Instead, prefer using `~` in your paths which will expand to the HOME directory. For example, instead of `%LocalAppData%`, use `~\\AppData\\Local`. For a list of supported default environment variables, see the [Learn GitHub Actions: Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) page.

609,"# github action maven release

The GitHub Action for Maven releases wraps the Maven CLI to enable Maven release to be run by a bot.
You can use this action for auto-releasing your java artefacts each time you commit into master.

The release will allow you to setup a GPG key for your bot.

# Usage

## Maven release

For a simple repo with not much protection and private dependency, you can do:

```
```
You can add some maven options, which is handy for skipping tests:
```
```

If you want to setup a GPG key, you can do it by injecting your key via the secrets:

Note: `GITHUB_GPG_KEY` needs to be base64 encoded.
if you haven\'t setup a GPG key yet, see next section

```
```


If you got a private maven repo to setup in the settings.xml, you can do:
Note: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.

```
```

Here is an example with all of the options at the same time:

```
 - name: Release
      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master
      with:
        release-branch-name: ""master""

        gpg-enabled: ""true""

        maven-repo-server-id: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-username: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}
        maven-repo-server-password: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_PASSWORD }}


        git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""
        git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""

        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

You may also be in the case where you got more than one maven projects inside the repo. We added an option that will make the release job move to the according directy before running the release:

```
```

We welcome contributions! If your usecase is slightly different than us, just suggest a RFE or contribute to this repo directly.

## Setup the bot gpg key

Setting up a gpg key for your bot is a good security feature. This way, you can enforce sign commits in your repo,
even for your release bot.

![Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9F6cxpqm/Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png)

- Create dedicate github account for your bot and add him into your team for your git repo.
- Create a new GPG key: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key

This github action needs the key ID and the key base64 encoded.

```$xslt
```

### Get the KID

You can get the key ID doing the following:

```$xslt
```
The key ID for my bot is 3EFC3104C0088B08. Add this value into your github secret for this repo, under `GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID`
PS: the key id is not really a secret but we found more elegant to store it there than in plain text in the github action yml

### Get the GPG private key

Now we need the raw key and base64 encode
```$xslt
```

Copy the result and add it in your github repo secrets under `GITHUB_GPG_KEY`.

Go the bot account in github and import this GPG key into its profile.

> GitHub Action for copying files to other repositories.

This is a [GitHub action](https://developer.github.com/actions/) to copy files from your repository to another external repository. It is also possible to copy files from/to repository Wikis.

This action runs in a Docker container and therefore only supports Linux.

## Usage

The following example [workflow step](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) will copy all files from the repository running the action, to a folder named `backup` in the destination repo `copycat-action`. If the files already exist at the destination repo, they will be overwritten.

```yml
```

## Options \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f

The following input variable options can/must be configured:

|Input variable|Necessity|Description|Default|
|--------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
|`src_path`|Required|The source path to the file(s) or folder(s) to copy from. For example `/.` or `path/to/home.md`.||
|`dst_path`|Optional|The destination path to copy the file(s) or folder(s) to. For example `/wiki/` or `path/to/index.md`. |`src_path`|
|`dst_owner`|Required|The name of the owner of the repository to push to. For example `andstor`.||
|`dst_repo_name`|Required|The name of the repository to push to. For example `copycat-action`.||
|`src_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in source repository to clone from.|`master`|
|`dst_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in the destination repository to push to. If the branch doesn\'t exists, the branch will be created based on the default branch.|`master`|
|`clean`|Optional|Set to `true` if the `dst_path` should be emptied before copying.|`false`|
|`file_filter`|Optional|A simple [pattern](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching) for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file basename. For example `*.sh`.||
|`filter`|Optional|A glob pattern for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file paths. For example `**/!(*.*)`.||
|`exclude`|Optional|A glob pattern for excluding paths. For example `*/tests/*`.||
|`src_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the source repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.| `false`|
|`dst_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the destination repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.|`false`|
|`commit_message`|Optional|A custom git commit message.||
|`username`|Optional|The GitHub username to associate commits made by this GitHub action.|[`GITHUB_ACTOR`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables)|

## Secrets

* `personal_token`: (required) GitHub Private Access Token used for the clone/push operations. To create it follow the [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

## Filtering
Copycat provides several ways of filtering which files you want to copy.  
All three types of filtering can be applied simultaneously.

### Input variables
#### `file_filter`
The `file_filter`input variable allows you to filter file basenames. Hence, you can for example only copy all text files by setting `file_filter`to `*.txt`. The variable only accepts simple [patterns](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching).

#### `filter`
The `filter` input variable provides extensive globbing support. It also supports extended globbing and globstar. The globbing applies to file paths. So, to for example match all files that doesn\'t have a file extention, the pattern could look like `**/!(*.*)`.

#### `exclude`
The `exclude` input variable can be used to exclude certain paths. It will apply to the file paths. One are for example able to exclude certain deirectory names. Setting `exclude` to `*/tests/*` results in only copying files that don\'t lie inside a folder named `tests` (both directly and indirectly). Here, a file with for example the path `foo/tests/bar/baz.txt` would not be copied over.

## Examples

### Copy wiki files to external repo

This workflow configuration will copy all files from the repository\'s wiki to a folder named `wiki` in the destination repo `andstor.github.io`.

This can for example be used to merge several wikies of an organisation, and display them on a custom GitHub Pages site. The Jekyll theme [Paper](https://github.com/andstor/jekyll-theme-paper) has support for this.

```yml
```

613,"# Execute Gradle builds in GitHub Actions workflows

This GitHub Action can be used to configure Gradle and optionally execute a Gradle build on any platform supported by GitHub Actions.

## Why use the `gradle-build-action`?

It is possible to directly invoke Gradle in your workflow, and the `actions/setup-java@v3` action provides a simple way to cache Gradle dependencies. 

However, the `gradle-build-action` offers a number of advantages over this approach:

- Easily [configure your workflow to use a specific version of Gradle](#use-a-specific-gradle-version) using the `gradle-version` parameter. Gradle distributions are automatically downloaded and cached. 
- More sophisticated and more efficient caching of Gradle User Home between invocations, compared to `setup-java` and most custom configurations using `actions/cache`. [More details below](#caching).
- Detailed reporting of cache usage and cache configuration options allow you to [optimize the use of the GitHub actions cache](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).
- [Generate and Submit a GitHub Dependency Graph](#github-dependency-graph-support) for your project, enabling Dependabot security alerts.
- [Automatic capture of Build Scan\xc2\xae links](#build-scans) from the build, making these easier to locate for workflow run.

The `gradle-build-action` is designed to provide these benefits with minimal configuration. 
These features work both when Gradle is executed via the `gradle-build-action` and for any Gradle execution in subsequent steps.

## Use the action to setup Gradle

The recommended way to use the `gradle-build-action` is in an initial ""Setup Gradle"" step, with subsquent steps invoking Gradle directly with a `run` step. This makes the action minimally invasive, and allows a workflow to configure and execute a Gradle execution in any way.

The `gradle-build-action` works by configuring environment variables and by adding a set of Gradle init-scripts to the Gradle User Home. These will apply to all Gradle executions on the runner, no matter how Gradle is invoked. 
This means that if you have an existing workflow that executes Gradle with a `run` step, you can add an initial ""Setup Gradle"" Step to benefit from caching, build-scan capture and other features of the gradle-build-action.


```yaml
```

## Choose a specific Gradle version

The `gradle-build-action` can download and install a specified Gradle version, adding this installed version to the PATH.
Downloaded Gradle versions are stored in the GitHub Actions cache, to avoid requiring downloading again later.

```yaml
```

The `gradle-version` parameter can be set to any valid Gradle version.

Moreover, you can use the following aliases:

| Alias | Selects |
| --- |---|
| `wrapper`           | The Gradle wrapper\'s version (default, useful for matrix builds) |
| `current`           | The current [stable release](https://gradle.org/install/) |
| `release-candidate` | The current [release candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate/) if any, otherwise fallback to `current` |
| `nightly`           | The latest [nightly](https://gradle.org/nightly/), fails if none. |
| `release-nightly`   | The latest [release nightly](https://gradle.org/release-nightly/), fails if none.      |

This can be handy to automatically verify your build works with the latest release candidate of Gradle:

The actual Gradle version used is available as an action output: `gradle-version`.

```yaml
```


## Caching build state between Jobs

The `gradle-build-action` will use the GitHub Actions cache to save and restore reusable state that may be speed up a subsequent build invocation. This includes most content that is downloaded from the internet as part of a build, as well as expensive to create content like compiled build scripts, transformed Jar files, etc.

The state that is cached includes:
- Any distributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter ;
- A subset of the Gradle User Home directory, including downloaded dependencies, wrapper distributions, and the local build cache ;

To reduce the space required for caching, this action makes a best effort to reduce duplication in cache entries.

State will be restored from the cache during the first `gradle-build-action` step for any workflow job, and cache entries will be written back to the cache at the end of the job, after all Gradle executions have completed.

### Disabling caching

Caching is enabled by default. You can disable caching for the action as follows:
```yaml
```

### Using the cache read-only

By default, the `gradle-build-action` will only write to the cache from Jobs on the default (`main`/`master`) branch.
Jobs on other branches will read entries from the cache but will not write updated entries. 
See [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness) for a more detailed explanation.

In some circumstances it makes sense to change this default, and to configure a workflow Job to read existing cache entries but not to write changes back.

You can configure read-only caching for the `gradle-build-action` as follows:

```yaml
```

You can also configure read-only caching only for certain branches:

```yaml
```

### Using the cache write-only

In certain circumstances it may be desirable to start with a clean Gradle User Home state, but to save that state at the end of a workflow Job:

```yaml
```

### Overwriting an existing Gradle User Home

When the action detects that the Gradle User Home caches directory already exists (`~/.gradle/caches`), then by default it will not overwrite the existing content of this directory.
This can occur when a prior action initializes this directory, or when using a self-hosted runner that retains this directory between uses.

In this case the Job Summary will display a message like: 
> Caching for gradle-build-action was disabled due to pre-existing Gradle User Home

If you want override the default and have the `gradle-build-action` caches overwrite existing content in the Gradle User Home, you can set the `cache-overwrite-existing` parameter to \'true\':

```yaml
```

### Incompatibility with other caching mechanisms

When using `gradle-build-action` we recommend that you avoid using other mechanisms to save and restore the Gradle User Home. 

Specifically:
- Avoid using `actions/cache` configured to cache the Gradle User Home, [as described in this example](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/examples.md#java---gradle).
- Avoid using `actions/setup-java` with the `cache: gradle` option, [as described here](https://github.com/actions/setup-java#caching-gradle-dependencies).

Using either of these mechanisms may interfere with the caching provided by this action. If you choose to use a different mechanism to save and restore the Gradle User Home, you should disable the caching provided by this action, as described above.

### Cache debugging and analysis

A report of all cache entries restored and saved is printed to the Job Summary when saving the cache entries. 
This report can provide valuable insignt into how much cache space is being used.

It is possible to enable additional debug logging for cache operations. You do via the `GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable:

```yaml
```

Note that this setting will also prevent certain cache operations from running in parallel, further assisting with debugging.

## How Gradle User Home caching works

### Properties of the GitHub Actions cache

The GitHub Actions cache has some properties that present problems for efficient caching of the Gradle User Home.
- Immutable entries: once a cache entry is written for a key, it cannot be overwritten or changed.
- Branch scope: cache entries written for a Git branch are not visible from actions running against different branches. Entries written for the default branch are visible to all. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache
- Restore keys: if no exact match is found, a set of partial keys can be provided that will match by cache key prefix. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key

Each of these properties has influenced the design and implementation of the caching in `gradle-build-action`, as described below.

### Which content is cached

Using experiments and observations, we have attempted to identify which Gradle User Home content is worth saving and restoring between build invocations. We considered both the respective size of the content and the impact this content has on build times. As well as the obvious candidates like downloaded dependencies, we saw that compiled build scripts, transformed Jar files and other content can also have a significant impact.

In the end, we opted to save and restore as much content as is practical, including:
- `caches/<version>/generated-gradle-jars`: These files are generated on first use of a particular Gradle version, and are expensive to recreate
- `caches/<version>/kotlin-dsl` and `caches/<version>/scripts`: These are the compiled build scripts. The Kotlin ones in particular can benefit from caching.
- `caches/modules-2`: The downloaded dependencies
- `caches/transforms-3`: The results of artifact transforms
- `caches/jars-9`: Jar files that have been processed/instrumented by Gradle
- `caches/build-cache-1`: The local build cache

In certain cases a particular section of Gradle User Home will be too large to make caching effective. In these cases, particular subdirectories can be excluded from caching. See [Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache](#exclude-content-from-gradle-user-home-cache).

### Cache keys

The actual content of the Gradle User Home after a build is the result of many factors, including:
- Core Gradle build files (`settngs.gradle[.kts]`, `build.gradle[.kts]`, `gradle.properties`)
- Associated Gradle configuration files (`gradle-wrapper.properties`, `dependencies.toml`, etc)
- The entire content of `buildSrc` or any included builds that provide plugins.
- The entire content of the repository, in the case of the local build cache.
- The actual build command that was invoked, including system properties and environment variables.

For this reason, it\'s very difficult to create a cache key that will deterministically map to a saved Gradle User Home state. So instead of trying to reliably hash all of these inputs to generate a cache key, the Gradle User Home cache key is based on the currently executing Job and the current commit hash for the repository.

The Gradle User Home cache key is composed of:
- The current operating system (`RUNNER_OS`)
- The workflow name and Job ID
- A hash of the Job matrix parameters
- The git SHA for the latest commit

Specifically, the cache key is: `${cache-protocol}-gradle|${runner-os}|${workflow-name}-${job-id}[${hash-of-job-matrix}]-${git-sha}`

As such, the cache key is likely to change on each subsequent run of GitHub actions. 
This allows the most recent state to always be available in the GitHub actions cache.

### Finding a matching cache entry

In most cases, no exact match will exist for the cache key. Instead, the Gradle User Home will be restored for the closest matching cache entry, using a set of ""restore keys"". The entries will be matched with the following precedence:
- An exact match on OS, workflow, job, matrix and Git SHA
- The most recent entry saved for the same OS, workflow, job and matrix values
- The most recent entry saved for the same OS, workflow and job
- The most recent entry saved for the same OS

Due to branch scoping of cache entries, the above match will be first performed for entries from the same branch, and then for the default (\'main\') branch.

After the Job is complete, the current Gradle User Home state will be collected and written as a new cache entry with the complete cache key. Old entries will be expunged from the GitHub Actions cache on a least-recently-used basis.

Note that while effective, this mechanism is not inherently efficient. It requires the entire Gradle User Home directory to be stored separately for each branch, for every OS+Job+Matrix combination. In addition, a new cache entry to be written on every GitHub Actions run. 

This inefficiency is effectively mitigated by [Deduplication of Gradle User Home cache entries](#deduplication-of-gradle-user-home-cache-entries), and can be further optimized for a workflow using the techniques described in [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).

### Deduplication of Gradle User Home cache entries

To reduce duplication between cache entries, certain artifacts in Gradle User Home are extracted and cached independently based on their identity. This allows each Gradle User Home cache entry to be relatively small, sharing common elements between them without duplication.

Artifacts that are cached independently include:
- Downloaded dependencies
- Downloaded wrapper distributions
- Generated Gradle API jars
- Downloaded Java Toolchains

For example, this means that all jobs executing a particular version of the Gradle wrapper will share a single common entry for this wrapper distribution and one for each of the generated Gradle API jars.

### Stopping the Gradle daemon

By default, the action will stop all running Gradle daemons in the post-action step, prior to saving the Gradle User Home state. 
This allows for any Gradle User Home cleanup to occur, and avoid file-locking issues on Windows.

If caching is disabled or the cache is in read-only mode, the daemon will not be stopped and will continue running after the job is completed.

## Optimizing cache effectiveness

Cache storage space for GitHub actions is limited, and writing new cache entries can trigger the deletion of existing entries.
Eviction of shared cache entries can reduce cache effectiveness, slowing down your `gradle-build-action` steps.

There are a number of actions you can take if your cache use is less effective due to entry eviction.

At the end of a Job, the `gradle-build-action` will write a summary of the Gradle builds executed, together with a detailed report of the cache entries that were read and written during the Job. This report can provide valuable insights that may help to determine the right way to optimize the cache usage for your workflow.

### Select which jobs should write to the cache

Consider a workflow that first runs a Job ""compile-and-unit-test"" to compile the code and run some basic unit tests, which is followed by a matrix of parallel ""integration-test"" jobs that each run a set of integration tests for the repository. Each ""integration test"" Job requires all of the dependencies required by ""compile-and-unit-test"", and possibly one or 2 additional dependencies.

By default, a new cache entry will be written on completion of each integration test job. If no additional dependencies were downloaded then this cache entry will share the ""dependencies"" entry with the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job, but if a single dependency was downloaded then an entire new ""dependencies"" entry would be written. (The `gradle-build-action` does not _yet_ support a layered cache that could do this more efficiently). If each of these ""integration-test"" entries with their different ""dependencies"" entries is too large, then it could result in other important entries being evicted from the GitHub Actions cache.

There are some techniques that can be used to avoid/mitigate this issue:
- Configure the ""integration-test"" jobs with `cache-read-only: true`, meaning that the Job will use the entry written by the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job. This will avoid the overhead of cache entries for each of these jobs, at the expense of re-downloading any additional dependencies required by ""integration-test"".
- Add an additional step to the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job which downloads all dependencies required by the integration-test jobs but does not execute the tests. This will allow the ""dependencies"" entry for ""compile-and-unit-test"" to be shared among all cache entries for ""integration-test"". The resulting ""integration-test"" entries should be much smaller, reducing the potential for eviction.
- Combine the above 2 techniques, so that no cache entry is written by ""integration-test"" jobs, but all required dependencies are already present from the restored ""compile-and-unit-test"" entry.

### Select which branches should write to the cache

GitHub cache entries are not shared between builds on different branches. 
This means that each PR branch will have it\'s own Gradle User Home cache, and will not benefit from cache entries written by other PR branches.
An exception to this is that cache entries written in parent and upstream branches are visible to child branches, and cache entries for the default (`master`/`main`) branch can be read by actions invoked for any other branch.

By default, the `gradle-build-action` will only _write_ to the cache for builds run on the default (`master`/`main`) branch. 
Jobs run on other branches will only read from the cache. In most cases, this is the desired behaviour, 
because Jobs run against other branches will benefit from the cache Gradle User Home from `main`, 
without writing private cache entries that could lead to evicting shared entries.

If you have other long-lived development branches that would benefit from writing to the cache, 
you can configure these by overriding the `cache-read-only` action parameter. 
See [Using the caches read-only](#using-the-caches-read-only) for more details.

Similarly, you could use `cache-read-only` for certain jobs in the workflow, and instead have these jobs reuse the cache content from upstream jobs.

### Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache

As well as any wrapper distributions, the action will attempt to save and restore the `caches` and `notifications` directories from Gradle User Home.

Each build is different, and some builds produce more Gradle User Home content than others.
[Cache debugging ](#cache-debugging-and-analysis) can provide insight into which cache entries are the largest,
and the contents to be cached can be fine tuned by including and excluding certain paths within Gradle User Home.

```yaml
```

You can specify any number of fixed paths or patterns to include or exclude. 
File pattern support is documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#patterns-to-match-file-paths.

### Remove unused files from Gradle User Home before saving to cache

The Gradle User Home directory has a tendency to grow over time. When you switch to a new Gradle wrapper version or upgrade a dependency version
the old files are not automatically and immediately removed. While this can make sense in a local environment, in a GitHub Actions environment
it can lead to ever-larger Gradle User Home cache entries being saved and restored.

In order to avoid this situation, the `gradle-build-action` supports the `gradle-home-cache-cleanup` parameter. 
When enabled, this feature will attempt to delete any files in the Gradle User Home that were not used by Gradle during the GitHub Actions workflow, 
prior to saving the Gradle User Home to the GitHub Actions cache.

Gradle Home cache cleanup is considered experimental and is disabled by default.  You can enable this feature for the action as follows:
```yaml
```

## Build reporting

The `gradle-build-action` collects information about any Gradle executions that occur in a workflow, and reports these via
a Job Summary, visible in the GitHub Actions UI. For each Gradle execution, details about the invocation are listed, together with
a link to any Build Scan\xc2\xae published.

Generation of a Job Summary is enabled by default. If this is not desired, it can be disable as follows:
```yaml
```

Note that the action collects information about Gradle invocations via an [Initialization Script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html#sec:using_an_init_script)
located at `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/build-result-capture.init.gradle`.
If you are using init scripts for the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise) like
[`scans-init.gradle` or `gradle-enterprise-init.gradle`](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#scans_gradle_com),
you\'ll need to ensure these files are applied prior to `build-result-capture.init.gradle`.
Since Gradle applies init scripts in alphabetical order, one way to ensure this is via file naming.

### Build Scan\xc2\xae link as Step output

As well as reporting the [Build Scan](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) link in the Job Summary,
the `gradle-build-action` action makes this link available as a Step output named `build-scan-url`.

You can then use that link in subsequent actions of your workflow. For example:

```yaml
```

### Saving build outputs

By default, a GitHub Actions workflow using `gradle-build-action` will record the log output and any Build Scan links for your build,
but any output files generated by the build will not be saved.

To save selected files from your build execution, you can use the core [Upload-Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.
For example:

```yaml
```

## Use the action to invoke Gradle

If the `gradle-build-action` is configured with an `arguments` input, then Gradle will execute a Gradle build with the arguments provided. NOTE: We recommend using the `gradle-build-action` as a ""Setup Gradle"" step as described above, with Gradle being invoked via a regular `run` command.

If no `arguments` are provided, the action will not execute Gradle, but will still cache Gradle state and configure build-scan capture for all subsequent Gradle executions.

```yaml
```

### Multiple Gradle executions in the same Job

It is possible to configure multiple Gradle executions to run sequentially in the same job. 
The initial Action step will perform the Gradle setup.

```yaml
```

### Gradle command-line arguments

The `arguments` input can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to the `gradle` command line.
Arguments can be supplied in a single line, or as a multi-line input.

Here are some valid examples:
```yaml
```

If you need to pass environment variables, use the GitHub Actions workflow syntax:

```yaml
```

### Gradle build located in a subdirectory

By default, the action will execute Gradle in the root directory of your project. 
Use the `build-root-directory` input to target a Gradle build in a subdirectory.

```yaml
```

### Using a specific Gradle executable

The action will first look for a Gradle wrapper script in the root directory of your project. 
If not found, `gradle` will be executed from the PATH.
Use the `gradle-executable` input to execute using a specific Gradle installation.

```yaml
```

This mechanism can also be used to target a Gradle wrapper script that is located in a non-default location.

## Support for GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

You can use the `gradle-build-action` on GitHub Enterprise Server, and benefit from the improved integration with Gradle. Depending on the version of GHES you are running, certain features may be limited:
- Build Scan links are captured and displayed in the GitHub Actions UI
- Easily run your build with different versions of Gradle
- Save/restore of Gradle User Home (requires GHES v3.5+ : GitHub Actions cache was introduced in GHES 3.5)
- Support for GitHub Actions Job Summary (requires GHES 3.6+ : GitHub Actions Job Summary support was introduced in GHES 3.6). In earlier versions of GHES the build-results summary and caching report will be written to the workflow log, as part of the post-action step.

# GitHub Dependency Graph support

The `gradle-build-action` has support for submitting a [GitHub Dependency Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph) snapshot via the [GitHub Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

The dependency graph snapshot is generated via integration with the [GitHub Dependency Graph Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin), and saved as a workflow artifact. The generated snapshot files can be submitted either in the same job, or in a subsequent job (in the same or a dependent workflow).

The generated dependency graph snapshot reports all of the dependencies that were resolved during a bulid execution, and is used by GitHub to generate [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) for vulnerable dependencies, as well as to populate the [Dependency Graph insights view](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph).

## Enable Dependency Graph generation for a workflow
 
You enable GitHub Dependency Graph support by setting the `dependency-graph` action parameter. Valid values are:

| Option | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `disabled`            | Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations.<p>This is the default. |
| `generate`            | Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact. |
| `generate-and-submit` | As per `generate`, but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job. |
| `download-and-submit` | Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step. |

Dependency Graph _submission_ (but not generation) requires the `contents: write` permission, which may need to be explicitly enabled in the workflow file.

Example of a simple workflow that generates and submits a dependency graph:
```yaml
```

The `contents: write` permission is not required to generate the dependency graph, but is required in order to submit the graph via the GitHub API.

The above configuration will work for workflows that run as a result of commits to a repository branch, but not when a workflow is triggered by a PR from a repository fork.
For a configuration that supports this setup, see [Dependency Graphs for pull request workflows](#dependency-graphs-for-pull-request-workflows).

## Limiting the scope of the dependency graph

At times it is helpful to limit the dependencies reported to GitHub, in order to security alerts for dependencies that don\'t form a critical part of your product.
For example, a vulnerability in the tool you use to generate documentation is unlikely to be as important as a vulnerability in one of your runtime dependencies.

There are a number of techniques you can employ to limit the scope of the generated dependency graph:
- [Don\'t generate a dependency graph for all Gradle executions](#choosing-which-gradle-invocations-will-generate-a-dependency-graph)
- [For a Gradle execution, filter which Gradle projects and configurations will contribute dependencies](#filtering-which-gradle-configurations-contribute-to-the-dependency-graph)
- [Use a separate workflow that only resolves the required dependencies]()

> [!NOTE]
> Ideally, all dependencies involved in building and testing a project will be extracted and reported in a dependency graph. 
> These dependencies would be assigned to different scopes (eg development, runtime, testing) and the GitHub UI would make it easy to opt-in to security alerts for different dependency scopes.
> However, this functionality does not yet exist.

### Choosing which Gradle invocations will generate a dependency graph

Once you enable the dependency graph support for a workflow job (via the `dependency-graph` parameter), dependencies will be collected and reported for all subsequent Gradle invocations.
If you have a Gradle build step that you want to exclude from dependency graph generation, you can set the `GITHUB_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.

```yaml
```

### Filtering which Gradle Configurations contribute to the dependency graph

If you do not want the dependency graph to include every dependency configuration in every project in your build, you can limit the
dependency extraction to a subset of these.

To restrict which Gradle subprojects contribute to the report, specify which projects to include via a regular expression.
You can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_PROJECTS` environment variable or system property.

To restrict which Gradle configurations contribute to the report, you can filter configurations by name using a regular expression.
You can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS` environment variable or system property.

For example, if you want to exclude dependencies in the `buildSrc` project, and only report on dependencies from the `runtimeClasspath` configuration,
you would use the following configuration:

```yaml
```

### Use a dedicated workflow for dependency graph generation

Instead of generating a dependency graph from your existing CI workflow, it\'s possible to create a separate dedicated workflow (or Job) that is solely intended for generating a dependency graph.
Such a workflow will still need to execute Gradle, but can do so in a way that is targeted at resolving exactly the dependencies required.

For example, the following workflow will report only those dependencies that are part of the `runtimeClasspath` or the `my-app` project. 

```yaml
```

Note that the above example will also include `buildSrc` dependencies, since these are resolved as part of running the `dependencies` task.
If this isn\'t desirable, you will still need to use the filtering mechanism described above.

## Dependency Graphs for pull request workflows

This `contents: write` permission is not available for any workflow that is triggered by a pull request submitted from a forked repository, since it would permit a malicious pull request to make repository changes. 

Because of this restriction, it is not possible to `generate-and-submit` a dependency graph generated for a pull-request that comes from a repository fork. In order to do so, 2 workflows will be required:
1. The first workflow runs directly against the pull request sources and will generate the dependency graph snapshot.
2. The second workflow is triggered on `workflow_run` of the first workflow, and will submit the previously saved dependency snapshots.

Note: when `download-and-submit` is used in a workflow triggered via [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run), the action will download snapshots saved in the triggering workflow.

***Main workflow file***
```yaml
```

***Dependent workflow file***
```yaml
```

## Gradle version compatibility

The GitHub Dependency Graph plugin should be compatible with all versions of Gradle >= 5.0, and has been tested against 
Gradle versions ""5.6.4"", ""6.9.4"", ""7.0.2"", ""7.6.2"", ""8.0.2"" and the current Gradle release.

The plugin is compatible with running Gradle with the configuration-cache enabled. However, this support is
limited to Gradle ""8.1.0"" and later:
- With Gradle ""8.0"", the build should run successfully, but an empty dependency graph will be generated.
- With Gradle <= ""7.6.4"", the plugin will cause the build to fail with configuration-cache enabled.

To use this plugin with versions of Gradle older than ""8.1.0"", you\'ll need to invoke Gradle with the
configuration-cache disabled.

# Gradle Enterprise plugin injection

The `gradle-build-action` provides support for injecting and configuring the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin into any Gradle build, without any modification to the project sources.
This is achieved via an init-script installed into Gradle User Home, which is enabled and parameterized via environment variables.

The same auto-injection behavior is available for the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin, which enriches any build scans published with additional useful information.

## Enabling Gradle Enterprise injection

In order to enable Gradle Enterprise for your build, you must provide the required configuration via environment variables. 

Here\'s a minimal example:

```yaml
```

This configuration will automatically apply `v3.14.1` of the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/), and publish build scans to https://ge.gradle.org.

Note that the `ge.gradle.org` server requires authentication in order to publish scans. The provided `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` isn\'t required by the Gradle Enterprise injection script, 
but will be used by the GE plugin in order to authenticate with the server.

## Configuring Gradle Enterprise injection

The `init-script` supports a number of additional configuration parameters that you may fine useful. All configuration options (required and optional) are detailed below:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION_ENABLED | :white_check_mark: | enables Gradle Enterprise injection |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL | :white_check_mark: | the URL of the Gradle Enterprise server |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SERVER | | allow communication with an untrusted server; set to _true_ if your Gradle Enterprise instance is using a self-signed certificate |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ENFORCE_URL | | enforce the configured Gradle Enterprise URL over a URL configured in the project\'s build; set to _true_ to enforce publication of build scans to the configured Gradle Enterprise URL |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION | :white_check_mark: | the version of the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) to apply |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION |  | the version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to apply, if any |
| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY_URL |  | the URL of the repository to use when resolving the GE and CCUD plugins; the Gradle Plugin Portal is used by default |

616,"# GitHub App Token

This [JavaScript GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#javascript-actions) can be used to impersonate a GitHub App when `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`\'s limitations are too restrictive and a personal access token is not suitable.

For instance, from [GitHub Actions\' docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow):

> When you use the repository\'s `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with the exception of `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch`, will not create a new workflow run.
> This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.
> For example, if a workflow run pushes code using the repository\'s `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when push events occur.

A workaround is to use a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) from a [personal user/bot account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts).
However, for organizations, GitHub Apps are [a more appropriate automation solution](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/#machine-vs-bot-accounts).

# urlchecker-action

A GitHub action to collect and check URLs in a project (code and documentation).
The action aims at detecting and reporting broken links.

## How to use it?

A set of examples are included in the [examples](examples) folder. A few detailed 
examples are also included below. Note that examples always reference the master branch,
however you should change them to reference a [release](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/releases).

### Example with Checkout

For most use cases, you will want to use the git repository that is being checked
for a GitHub actions, and we do this by way of the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

```
```

Note that as of version 0.2.2, references to `white_listed_*` have been changed to
`exclude_*` to be consistent with the `include_*` variables.


### Example with Custom Clone

It could, however, be the case that you\'ve set up a repository with one or more uses of the URLChecker
that must clone one or more repos (possibly with varying branches) before doing the check.
In this case, you might want to define `git_path` and `branch` for each section.
An example is below:

```
```

## Details

### Hidden File Types

If you need to specify a file_types pattern to include hidden files, you\'ll need a `.*` pattern that is provided in the context of a comma separated list, for example:

```yaml
```
If there is another pattern or variable specification that you\'d like to see an example of here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/issues).

619,"# Skip Duplicate Actions

`skip-duplicate-actions` provides the following features to optimize GitHub Actions:

- [Skip duplicate workflow runs](#skip-duplicate-workflow-runs) after merges, pull requests or similar.
- [Skip concurrent or parallel workflow runs](#skip-concurrent-workflow-runs) for things that you do not want to run twice.
- [Skip ignored paths](#skip-ignored-paths) to speedup documentation-changes or similar.
- [Skip if paths not changed](#skip-if-paths-not-changed) for something like directory-specific tests.
- [Cancel outdated workflow runs](#cancel-outdated-workflow-runs) after branch-pushes.

All of those features help to save time and costs; especially for long-running workflows.
You can choose any subset of those features.

## Skip duplicate workflow runs

If you work with feature branches, then you might see lots of _duplicate workflow runs_.
For example, duplicate workflow runs can happen if a workflow run is performed on a feature branch, but then the workflow run is repeated right after merging the feature branch.
`skip-duplicate-actions` allows to prevent such runs.

- **Full traceability:** After clean merges, you will see a message like `Skip execution because the exact same files have been successfully checked in <previous_run_URL>`.
- **Fully configurable:** By default, manual triggers and cron will never be skipped.
- **Flexible Git usage:** `skip-duplicate-actions` does not care whether you use fast-forward-merges, rebase-merges or squash-merges.
  However, if a merge yields a result that is different from the source branch, then the resulting workflow run will _not_ be skipped.
  This is commonly the case if you merge ""outdated branches"".

## Skip concurrent workflow runs

Sometimes, there are workflows that you do not want to run twice at the same time even if they are triggered twice.
Therefore, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides the following options to skip a workflow run if the same workflow is already running:

- **Always skip:** This is useful if you have a workflow that you never want to run twice at the same time.
- **Only skip same content:** For example, this can be useful if a workflow has both a `push` and a `pull_request` trigger, or if you push a tag right after pushing a commit.
  (_Deprecated_, use `same_content_newer` instead)
- **Only skip newer runs with the same content:** If the same workflow is running on the exact same content, skip newer runs of it. `same_content_newer` ensures that at least one of those workflows will run, while `same_content` may skip all of them.
- **Only skip outdated runs:** For example, this can be useful for skip-checks that are not at the beginning of a job.
- **Never skip:** This disables the concurrent skipping functionality, but still lets you use all other options like duplicate skipping.

## Skip ignored paths

In many projects, it is unnecessary to run all tests for documentation-only-changes.
Therefore, GitHub provides a [paths-ignore](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore) feature out of the box.
However, GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` has some limitations:

- GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` fails to look at previous commits. This means that the outcome depends on how often you push changes.
- Consequently, GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` does not work for [required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-required-status-checks).
  If you path-ignore a required check, then pull requests will block forever without being mergeable.

To overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more flexible `paths_ignore`-feature with an efficient backtracking-algorithm.
Instead of stupidly looking at the current commit, `paths_ignore` will look for successful checks in your commit-history.

You can use the [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) option if you need to define multiple `paths_ignore` patterns in a single workflow.

## Skip if paths not changed

In some projects, there are tasks that should be only executed if specific sub-directories were changed.
Therefore, GitHub provides a [paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) feature out of the box.
However, GitHub\'s `paths` has some limitations:

- GitHub\'s `paths` cannot skip individual steps in a workflow.
- GitHub\'s `paths` does not work with required checks that you really want to pass successfully.

To overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more sophisticated `paths`-feature.
Instead of blindly skipping checks, the backtracking-algorithm will only skip something if it can find a suitable check in your commit-history.

You can use the [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) option if you need to define multiple `paths` patterns in a single workflow.

## Cancel outdated workflow runs

Typically, workflows should only run for the most recent commit.
Therefore, when you push changes to a branch, `skip-duplicate-actions` can be configured to cancel any previous workflow runs that run against outdated commits.

- **Full traceability:** If a workflow run is cancelled, then you will see a message like `Cancelled <previous_run_URL>`.
- **Guaranteed execution:** The cancellation-algorithm guarantees that a complete check-set will finish no matter what.

## Inputs

### `paths_ignore`

A JSON-array with ignored path patterns.
See [cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet) for path-pattern examples.
See [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) for details about supported path-patterns.

**Example:** `\'[""**/README.md"", ""**/docs/**""]\'`

**Default:** `\'[]\'`

### `paths`

A JSON-array with path patterns.
If this is non-empty, then `skip-duplicate-actions` will try to skip commits that did not change any of those paths.
It uses the same syntax as [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore).

**Example:** `\'[""platform-specific/**""]\'`

**Default:** `\'[]\'`

### `paths_filter`

A YAML-string with named [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns.

**Example:**

```yaml
```

Useful if you have multiple jobs in one workflow and want to skip them based on different [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns.
See the corresponding [`paths_result`](#paths_result) output and [example configuration](#example-3-skip-using-paths_filter).

### `cancel_others`

If true, then workflow runs from outdated commits will be cancelled.

**Default:** `\'false\'`

### `skip_after_successful_duplicate`

If true, skip if an already finished duplicate run can be found.

**Default:** `\'true\'`

### `do_not_skip`

A JSON-array with triggers that should never be skipped.

Possible values are `pull_request`, `push`, `workflow_dispatch`, `schedule`, `release`.

**Default:** `\'[""workflow_dispatch"", ""schedule""]\'`

### `concurrent_skipping`

Skip a workflow run if the same workflow is already running.

One of `never`, `same_content`, `same_content_newer`, `outdated_runs`, `always`.

**Default:** `\'never\'`

## Outputs

### `should_skip`

Returns `\'true\'` if the current run should be skipped according to your configured rules. This should be evaluated for either individual steps or entire jobs.

### `reason`

The reason why the current run is considered skippable or unskippable. Corresponds approximately to the input options.

**Example:** `skip_after_successful_duplicate`

### `skipped_by`

Returns information about the workflow run which caused the current run to be skipped.

**Example:**

```json
```

- Returns information only when current run is considered skippable, otherwise an empty object (`{}`) is returned.

### `paths_result`

Returns information for each configured filter in `paths_filter`.

**Example:**

```jsonc
```

- The `global` key corresponds to the ""global"" [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) and [`paths`](#paths) options.
- A list of matched files is returned in `matched_files`, if there are any.
- The `skipped_by` return value behaves the same as the ""global"" [`skipped_by`](#skipped_by) output.
- The `backtrack_count` shows how many commits where traced back (skipped) until an appropriate commit has been found.
- If `skip-duplicate-actions` terminates before the paths checks are performed (for example, when a successful duplicate run has been found) an empty object is returned (`{}`).

### `changed_files`

A two-dimensional array, with a list of changed files for each commit that has been traced back.

**Example:** `[[""some/example/file.txt"", ""another/example/file.txt""], [""frontend/file.txt""]]`

- Having a two-dimensional list makes processing flexible. For example, one can flatten (and uniquify) the list to get changed files from all commits which were traced back. Or one can use `changed_files[0]` to get changed files from the latest commit. One might also use the output of `backtrack_count` from [`paths_result`](#paths_result) to process the list of changed files.
- Returns information only if one of the options [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore), [`paths`](#paths), [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) is set.
- If `skip-duplicate-actions` terminates before the paths checks are performed (for example, when a successful duplicate run has been found) an empty array (`[]`) is returned.

## Usage examples

You can use `skip-duplicate-actions` to either skip individual steps or entire jobs.
To minimize changes to existing jobs, it is often easier to skip entire jobs.

> **Note**
>
> - You may need to use [`fromJSON`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson) to access properties of object outputs. For example, for `skipped_by.id`, you can use the expression: `${{ fromJSON(steps.skip_check.outputs.skipped_by).id }}`.
> - For GitHub repositories where [default permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) for `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been set to ""permissive (read-only)"", the following lines must be included in the workflow (see [permissions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions)):
>   ```yaml
>   # Minimum permissions required by skip-duplicate-actions
>   permissions:
>     actions: write
>     contents: read
>   ```

### Example 1: Skip entire jobs

To skip entire jobs, you should add a `pre_job` that acts as a pre-condition for your `main_job`.
Although this example looks like a lot of code, there are only two additional lines in your project-specific `main_job` (the `needs`-clause and the `if`-clause):

```yml
```

### Example 2: Skip individual steps

The following example demonstrates how to skip an individual step with an `if`-clause and an `id`.
In this example, the step will be skipped if no files in `src/` or `dist/` were changed:

```yml
```

### Example 3: Skip using `paths_filter`

The `paths_filter` option can be used if you have multiple jobs in a workflow and want to skip them based on different [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns. When defining such filters, the action returns corresponding information in the [`paths_result`](#paths_result) output.
For example in a monorepo, you might want to run jobs related to the ""frontend"" only if some files in the corresponding ""frontend/"" folder have changed and the same for ""backend"". This can be achieved with the following configuration:

```yml
```

## How does it work?

`skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Workflow Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs) to query workflow runs.
`skip-duplicate-actions` will only look at workflow runs that belong to the same workflow as the current workflow run.
After querying such workflow runs, it will compare them with the current workflow run as follows:

- If there exists a workflow run with the same tree hash, then we have identified a duplicate workflow run.
- If there exists an in-progress workflow run, then we can cancel it or skip, depending on your configuration.

## How does path-skipping work?

As mentioned above, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a path-skipping functionality that is somewhat similar to GitHub\'s native `paths` and `paths_ignore` functionality.
However, path-skipping is not entirely trivial because there exist multiple options on how to do path-skipping:

### Option 1: Only look at the ""current"" commit

This is the thing that GitHub is currently doing, and we consider it as insufficient because it does not work for ""required"" checks.
Another problem is that the outcomes can be heavily dependent on the pushing-sequence of commits.

### Option 2: Look at Pull-Request-diffs

PR-diffs are simple to understand, but they only work after opening a PR, not immediately after pushing a feature-branch.

### Option 3: Look for successful checks of previous commits

This option is implemented by `skip-duplicate-actions`.
An advantage is that this works regardless of whether you are using PRs or raw feature-branches, and of course it also works for ""required"" checks.
Internally, `skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Repos Commit API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#get-a-commit) to perform an efficient backtracking-algorithm for paths-skipping-detection.

This is how the algorithm works approximately:

```mermaid
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to Use Skip Check With Required Matrix Jobs?

Discussed in https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions/issues/44.

If you have matrix jobs that are registered as required status checks and the matrix runs conditionally based on the skip check, you might run into the problem that the pull request remains in a unmergable state forever because the jobs are not executed at all and thus not reported as skipped (`Expected - Waiting for status to be reported`).

There are several approaches to circumvent this problem:

- Define the condition (`if`) in each step in the matrix job instead of a single condition on the job level: https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions/issues/44
- If you want the check to be considered successful only if all jobs in the matrix were successful, you can add a subsequent job whose only task is to report the final status of the matrix. Then you can register this final job as a required status check:
  ```yaml
  result:
    name: Result
    if: needs.pre_job.outputs.should_skip != \'true\' && always()
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - pre_job
      - example-matrix-job
    steps:
      - name: Mark result as failed
        if: needs.example-matrix-job.result != \'success\'
        run: exit 1
  ```
- Define an opposite workflow, as offically suggested by GitHub: [Handling skipped but required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks)

620,"# Backport Github Action

## Getting started

Create a file `/.github/workflows/backport.yml` with the following content:

```yml
```

Now, to backport a pull request, simply apply the label `backport-to-production`. This will automatically backport the PR to the branch called ""production"" when the PR is merged. 

## Configuration

For more fine grained customization, and for the ability to run the [Backport Tool](https://github.com/sqren/backport) as a CLI tool locally, you should create a `.backportrc.json` file in the root directory:

```js
```


 See the [Backport Tool documentation](https://github.com/sqren/backport/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md) for all configuration options.

# Default Project Board Action

Intended to be used to set a default board for all new issues to automatically be added to.

## Usage

```yaml
```

`project` could be set to any project number, found in the slug when you view your project on github.

## Package for distribution

GitHub Actions will run the entry point from the action.yml. Packaging assembles the code into one file that can be checked in to Git, enabling fast and reliable execution and preventing the need to check in node_modules.

Actions are run from GitHub repos. Packaging the action will create a packaged action in the dist folder.

Run package

```bash
```

Since the packaged index.js is run from the dist folder.

```bash
```

623,"# Run GitHub CI in Solaris ![Test](https://github.com/vmactions/solaris-vm/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

Use this action to run your CI in Solaris.

The github workflow only supports Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS. But what if you need to use Solaris?

This action is to support Solaris.


Sample workflow `test.yml`:

```yml
```


The latest major version is: `v0`, which is the most recommended to use. (You can also use the latest full version: `v0.0.9`)  



The `runs-on: macos-12` must be `macos-12`.

The `envs: \'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2\'` is the env names that you want to pass into the vm.

The `run: xxxxx`  is the command you want to run in the vm.

The env variables are all copied into the VM, and the source code and directory are all synchronized into the VM.

The working dir for `run` in the VM is the same as in the Host machine.

All the source code tree in the Host machine are mounted into the VM.

All the `GITHUB_*` as well as `CI=true` env variables are passed into the VM.

So, you will have the same directory and same default env variables when you `run` the CI script.



The code is shared from the host to the VM via `rsync`, you can choose to use to `sshfs` share code instead.


```
```


When using `rsync`,  you can define `copyback: false` to not copy files back from the VM in to the host.


```
```



You can add NAT port between the host and the VM.

```
```


The default memory of the VM is 1024MB, you can use `mem` option to set the memory size:

```
```



It uses [the latest Solaris 11.4](conf/default.release.conf) by default, you can use `release` option to use another version of Solaris:

```
```

All the supported releases are here: [Solaris  11.4](conf)


# Under the hood

GitHub only supports Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS out of the box.

However, the MacOS support virtualization. It has VirtualBox installed.

So, we run the Solaris VM in VirtualBox on MacOS.

![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/avinal/github-pages-deploy-action?style=flat-square)

Plenty of people use Python site generators and lot other people use Javadoc to document their code. The process of hosting these are really time taking and often it is done manually in multiple steps such as, run site/documetnation generator on local machine then commit all changes to some branch and then push generated files to GitHub. How awesome it will be if you can automate these tasks? You just have to document your code and rest part will be automatically happen as soon as you push changes to GitHub. If you have used GitLab, this process is almost streamlined. Sadly GitHub doesn\'t natively support Python and other generators. GitHub only support Jekyll natively. 

No more worries now. GitHub Action can do that. You just have to document your code and rest part will be automatically happen as soon as you push changes to GitHub. Currently Java and Python are supported. Support for other languages will be available soon. 

## How to automate these actions ? 
1. A GitHub Actions WorkFlow configuration - Same workflow configuration can work for multiple repository using same generators. A general configuration is given below. 
```yml
```
2. A Makefile with commands to generate html files. Given below are two simplest Makefiles for Java and Python Pelican Static Site generator. Feel free to add more configurations.
    * Java
        ```makefile
            BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)
            OUTPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/docs # you may change docs with custom folder name
            PACKAGE=<your-java-package-name> # write the package name here

            html:
                javadoc ""$(PACKAGE)"" -d ""$(OUTPUTDIR)"" -encoding UTF-8

            .PHONY: html
        ```
    You can add additional command line arguments to javadoc. 
    * Pelican static site generator (Python)
        ```makefile
            PY?=python3
            PELICAN?=pelican
            PELICANTHEME?=pelican-themes

            BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)
            INPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/content
            OUTPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/output
            THEMEDIR=$(BASEDIR)/themes/alchemy
            CONFFILE=$(BASEDIR)/pelicanconf.py
            PUBLISHCONF=$(BASEDIR)/publishconf.py

            theme:
\t            ""$(PELICANTHEME)"" --install ""$(THEMEDIR)""

            html: theme
                ""$(PELICAN)"" ""$(INPUTDIR)"" -o ""$(OUTPUTDIR)"" -s ""$(CONFFILE)"" $(PELICANOPTS)

            .PHONY: theme html
        ```
    Most Python Static-site/documentation generators provides a default **Makefile**. You can use the same with minor changes.
3. After this action is ran first time, a new branch will be created. You have to tell GitHub to use that branch for GitHub Pages. 
    * Goto your repository *Settings* and scroll down to *GitHub Pages.
    * Under *Source* click on *Branch* drop-down menu and select the new branch(e.g- gh-pages) and click *Save*.
    * A message will appear above this setting e.g - **Your site is published at https://avinal.github.io/**. This is your website address. You can now use it anywhere. 
First deployment may take up to 30 minutes to be published.

**Hurray, You have successfully automated your site/documentation process \xf0\x9f\x98\x81**


## Useful Awesome code snippets and tricks used in this GitHub Action
1. Git
    * Clone a single specific git branch
        ```shell
                ```
    * Create empty branch and publish
        ```shell
            git checkout --orphan <empty-branch-name>
            git rm -rf .
            git commit --allow-empty -m ""<commit-message>""
            git push origin <empty-branch-name>
        ```
    * Reset every unstaged changes 
        ```shell
                ```
2. Shell Script
    * Use a command stored in a variable
        ```shell
            # let command be git branch -v
            command=""git branch -v""
            command_array=(${command})
            ""${command_array[@]}""
        ```
    * Copy a folder with exact same directory-structure and files to another folder
        ```shell
                ```
    * Install a package without recommended packages
        ```shell
                ```
3. Docker
    * Run commands in non interactive mode in Debian based containers while installing packages like tzdata
    ```dockerfile
        # add these to your Dockerfile
        ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
        ENV TZ=<TimeZone>/<City>
        # Now run
        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y tzdata <other-packages>

- Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release-with-release-notes) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

| Input                             | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `changelog_file` _(optional)_     | The input path of the changelog file. Default: `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `release_notes_file` _(optional)_ | The output path of the (optional) release notes file.         |

### Outputs

| Output          | Description                |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| `release_notes` | The escaped release notes. |

### Example workflow - create a release with release notes

On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `*.*.*`, extract the release notes from the `CHANGELOG.md` file and [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases):

```yaml
```

This code will extract the content between the second and third H2 header from the `CHANGELOG.md` file, store this content in the output variable `release_notes` and create a release using the [`gh release create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create) command.

## Examples

### Use a dedicated changelog file

```yaml
```

### Create a release notes file

```yaml
```

### Extract prerelease notes

To extract the content between the first (`## [Unreleased]`) and second H2 header, set the `prerelease` parameter to `true`.

```yaml
```

This GitHub Action downloads, installs and configures JFrog CLI, so that it can be used as part of the workflow.

In addition, the Action includes the following features, when using JFrog CLI to work with JFrog Platform.
* The connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets. Read more about it [here](#Storing-JFrog-Connection-Details-as-Secrets).
* There\'s no need to add the *build name* and *build number* options and arguments to commands which accept them.
All build related operations will be automatically recorded with the *Workflow Name* as build name and *Run Number* as build number.

# Usage
## General

```yml
```

## Storing JFrog connection details as secrets
The connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets.
You can use one of the following two methods to define and store the JFrog Platform connection details as secrets.
1. [Storing the connection details using separate environment variables](#Storing-the-connection-details-using-separate-environment-variables).
2. [Storing the connection details using single Config Token](#Storing-the-connection-details-using-single-Config-Token).

### Storing the connection details using separate environment variables
You can set the connection details to your JFrog Platform by using one of the following environment variables combinations:
1. JF_URL (no authentication)
2. JF_URL + JF_USER + JF_PASSWORD (basic authentication)
3. JF_URL + JF_ACCESS_TOKEN (authentication using a JFrog Access Token)

You can use these environment variables in your workflow as follows:
```yml
```

| Important: If both Config Token(JF_ENV_*) and separate environment variables(JF_URL, ...) are provided, the default config will be the Config Token. To make the above separate environment variables as the default config use ```jf c use setup-jfrog-cli-server``` |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Storing the connection details using single Config Token
1. Make sure JFrog CLI is installed on your local machine by running ```jf -v```.
2. Configure the details of the JFrog platform by running ```jf c add```.
3. Export the details of the JFrog platform you configured, using the server ID you chose. Do this by running ```jf c export <SERVER ID>```.
4. Copy the generated Config Token to the clipboard and save it as a secret on GitHub.

To use the saved JFrog platform configuration in the workflow, all you need to do it to expose the secret to the workflow.
The secret should be exposed as an environment variable with the *JF_ENV_* prefix.
Here\'s how you do this:
```yml
```
As you can see in the example above, we created a secret named *JF_SECRET_ENV_1* and exposed it to the workflow 
as the *JF_ENV_1* environment variable. That\'s it - the ping command will now ping the configured Artifactory server.

If you have multiple Config Tokens as secrets, you can use all of them in the workflow as follows:
```yml
```
| Important: When exposing more than one JFrog configuration to the Action, you should always add the ```jf c use``` command to specify the server to use. |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Setting the build name and build number when publishing build-info to Artifactory
The Action automatically sets the following environment variables:
*JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NAME* and *JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NUMBER* with the workflow name and run number respectively.
You therefore don\'t need to specify the build name and build number on any of the build related JFrog CLI commands.

In the following example, all downloaded files are registered as dependencies of the build and all uploaded files
are registered as the build artifacts. 
```yml
```

## Setting JFrog CLI version
By default, the JFrog CLI version set in [action.yml](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/blob/master/action.yml) is used. To set a specific version, add the *version* input as follows:

```yml
```

It is also possible to set the latest JFrog CLI version by adding the *version* input as follows:

```yml
```

| Important: Only JFrog CLI versions 1.29.0 or above are supported. |
| --- |

## Downloading JFrog CLI from Artifactory
If your agent has no Internet access, you can configure the workflow to download JFrog CLI from a [remote repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Remote+Repositories) in your JFrog Artifactory, which is configured to proxy the official download URL.

Here\'s how you do this:

1. Create a remote repository in Artifactory. Name the repository jfrog-cli-remote and set its URL to https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/
2. Set *download-repository* input to jfrog-cli-remote:
    ```yml
    - uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3
      env:
       # JFrog platform url (for example: https://acme.jfrog.io) 
        JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}
    
        # Basic authentication credentials
        JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}
        JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}
    
        # JFrog platform access token (if JF_USER and JF_PASSWORD are not provided)
        # JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
   
        # Same can be achieved with a Config Token using JF_ENV_1 environment variable
        # JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}
      with:
        download-repository: jfrog-cli-remote
    ```

* See instructions for configuring the JFrog connection details under [Storing JFrog connection details as secrets](#storing-jfrog-connection-details-as-secrets).

630,"find-latest-tag
===============

[GitHub Action][] to **find the latest tag in a GitHub repository**

## Examples

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

[Find usages in the wild!](https://github.com/search?l=YAML&q=%22oprypin%2Ffind-latest-tag%22&type=Code)

## Usage

### Inputs

* **`repository: username/reponame`**

  **Required.** Name of a repository on GitHub, with owner; this refers to https://github.com/username/reponame.git.

* **`releases-only: true`**

  Consider only tags that have an associated release.

* **`releases-only: false`** (default)

  Consider all tags.

* **`prefix: \'someprefix-\'`**

  Consider only tags starting with this string prefix, like ""someprefix-1.2.3"". The prefix will **not** be excluded from the result.

* **`regex: \'regex pattern\'`**

  Consider only tags that match the specified regular expression pattern (not anchored).
  For example, `regex: \'^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$\'` matches tags such as `1.2.3` etc.

* **`sort-tags: true`** (default)

  Look through all tags to find the one with the [greatest (semver-like) version](#version-precedence).

* **`sort-tags: false`** (default for `releases-only: true`)

  Return the first tag reported by GitHub. It\'s safe to rely on this being the **most recently created** release only for `releases-only: false`. When looking at tags, the behavior is undefined.

* **`token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}`**

  Required for scanning tags of **other private repositories** (referred to as *destination* repo), because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only gives access to the repository that\'s *running* the action (and public ones).

  Then a user that has access to the destination repository needs to [create](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `repo` access, and that token\'s value should be [added as a repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to the *running* repository under the name ""`PERSONAL_TOKEN`"".

  See also: [Example](https://github.com/oprypin/find-latest-tag/blob/85ce4ccf033896cde4cd274773bacb49758cca11/.github/workflows/release.yml#L26-L31), [Security considerations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#considering-cross-repository-access).

### Outputs

* **`tag`** (`${{ steps.some_step_id.outputs.tag }}`)

  The tag that was found is made available as the step\'s output.

### Errors

The action exits with an error if:

* the `repository` input is invalid;
* any HTTP error happens;
    * the repository doesn\'t exist;
    * the repository isn\'t public;
* no tags (or releases, if that\'s what chosen) are found;
* none of the tags match the `prefix`.

## Version precedence

The action looks at tags in [natural sort order][] (i.e. lexicographic with the consideration of multi-digit numbers), with a special exception for ""pre-release identifiers"" (letters that immediately follow a number).

Example in ascending order:

* `v1.3` (goes first just because others don\'t have the ""v"")
* `1.1.2` (lowest minor version)
* `1.2rc1` (precedes the following as a ""release candidate"" of 1.2)
* `1.2` (actual release)
* `1.2.1` (patch release)
* `1.11` (much later version; `11 > 2` even if `\'1\' < \'2\'`)

(and so `1.11` would be chosen as the ""greatest"").

This handling is compatible with [SemVer][], but more general.

There is no attempt to isolate the version number from other text that may be part of the tag name. But that\'s not a problem if the tags have a matching prefix, e.g. `Release-1.2.3` and `Release-1.2.4`. But, `Foo-3.4.5` would precede these just because `\'F\' < \'R\'`.

## Update from April 11th, 2022

**Semgrep now supports GitHub Actions natively!** :tada:

Refer to the [GitHub Actions configuration document](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file) to run Semgrep natively in CI environments.

## Project summary

| **:warning: Warning :warning:** |
| --------------------------  |
| This wrapper script is **deprecated**. It is recommended to stop using this wrapper script and migrate to native Semgrep support instead. Refer to the [GitHub Actions configuration document](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file). |

Semgrep Action runs Semgrep in CI environments. It can also connect to Semgrep App to configure rules and review findings on a web UI.

To see all the configuration options, [check Semgrep docs](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file).
Semgrep Action runs [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) in CI environments.
It can also connect to [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-app) to configure rules and review findings on a web UI.

- **Scan every commit.** Semgrep CI rapidly scans modified files on pull and merge requests, protecting developer productivity. Longer full project scans are configurable on merges to specific branches.
- **Block new bugs.** You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to fix existing bugs just to adopt a tool. Semgrep CI reports newly introduced issues on pull and merge requests, scanning them at their base and HEAD commits to compare findings. Developers are signficantly more likely to fix the issues they introduced themselves on PRs and MRs.
- **Get findings where you work.** Semgrep CI can connect to Semgrep App to present findings in Slack, on PRs and MRs via inline comments, email, and through 3rd party services.

> Semgrep runs fully in your build environment: code is never sent anywhere.

## Getting started

Semgrep behaves like other static analysis and linting tools:
it runs a set of user-configured rules and returns a non-zero exit code if there are findings,
resulting in its job showing a \xe2\x9c\x85 or \xe2\x9d\x8c.

Refer to [Getting started with Semgrep in CI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/overview/) to set up a CI job with Semgrep.

Once Semgrep Action is running, [explore the Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r) to find and add more project-specific rules.

## Configuration

See the [Semgrep in CI configuration reference](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/configuration-reference/) for further customizations, such as scanning with custom rules, ignoring files, and tuning performance.

## Metrics

Semgrep collects opt-out non-identifiable aggregate metrics for improving the user experience, guiding Semgrep feature development, and identifying regressions.

The [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) file describes the principles that guide our data-collection decisions, the breakdown of the data that are and are not collected, and how to opt-out of Semgrep CI\xe2\x80\x99s metrics.

> Semgrep never sends your source code anywhere.

## Technical details

### Packaging

The [Semgrep Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/semgrep-action) GitHub Marketplace listing
runs the [`semgrep-agent` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/returntocorp/semgrep-agent).

New versions of Semgrep CI and the Docker image above are released by Semgrep maintainers on a regular basis.
To run all jobs with the latest releases, use the `returntocorp/semgrep` Docker image, or the `returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1` action.

A GitHub Action that post comment on a GitHub Issue or Pull Request.
If the same content is posted before, this action will delete the existing one and post a new one.

This action extract the number from an issue or a pull request which has triggered this by default. You don't need to specify the issue number by `${{ github.event.issue.number }}` or `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` if you want to post to its issue or pull request.

## Usage

```yml
```

### Post a comment and close the previous same comment

This is just an example to show one way in which this action can be used.

```yml
```

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-only-first-line` | If `true`, If the first line is same, it is considered to be the same post. It works when `unique` is `true`. | `false` |  
| `comment` | Comment to post. | - (Required) |
| `unique` | If `true`, existing comment with same body will be deleted. | `true` |
| `number` | The number of the issue to post. | `github.event.issue.number` |
| `repository` | The GitHub repository containing the issue or pr. | Current repository |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

### Action outputs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `deleted-comment` | If there was existing same comments or not that was deleted |
| `deleted-comment-id` | The deleted comment ID | 
| `comment-id` | The posted comment ID | 
| `match-first-line` | If match first line or not | 

### Accessing issues in other repositories

You can close issues in another repository by using a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
The user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository.

## Acknowledgement
I've derived the design for this action from @peter-evans's GitHub Actions.
Thanks to @perter-evans and the contributors for all the hard work and sharing it as an opensource project.

634,"# Pull Request Comment Trigger

Look for a ""trigger word"" in a pull-request description or comment, so that later steps can know whether or not to run.

<!-- TODO release workflow-preprocessor This is most useful in tandem with [workflow-preprocessor], so that you don\'t have to be writing a ton of `if`s all down the line. -->

## Example usage in a workflow

Your workflow needs to listen to the following events:
```
```

And then you can use the action in your jobs like this:

```
```

Reaction must be one of the reactions here: https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#reaction-types
And if you specify a reaction, you have to provide the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env vbl.

## Inputs

| Input | Required? | Description |
| ----- | --------- | ----------- |
| trigger | Yes | The string to look for in pull-request descriptions and comments. For example ""#build/android"". |
| prefix_only | No (default \'false\') | If \'true\', the trigger must match the start of the comment. |
| reaction | No (default \'\') | If set, the specified emoji ""reaction"" is put on the comment to indicate that the trigger was detected. For example, ""rocket"". |


## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| triggered | \'true\' or \'false\' depending on if the trigger phrase was found. |
| comment_body | The comment body. |

## Supporting the Project

The continued development of Support Requests is made possible
thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them,
please consider contributing with
[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=support-requests&src=repo),
[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=support-requests&src=repo) or
[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=support-requests&src=repo).

## Description

Support Requests is a specialized version of
[Label Actions](https://github.com/dessant/label-actions),
and it can perform the following actions when an issue
is labeled, unlabeled or reopened:

- The support label is added: leave a comment, close and lock the issue
- The support label is removed: reopen and unlock the issue
- The issue is reopened: remove the support label, unlock the issue

## Usage

Create the `support.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory,
use one of the [example workflows](#examples) to get started.

### Inputs

The action can be configured using [input parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- **`github-token`**
  - GitHub access token, value must be `${{ github.token }}` or an encrypted
    secret that contains a [personal access token](#using-a-personal-access-token)

- **`support-label`**
  - Label used to mark issues as support requests
  - Optional, defaults to `support`
- **`issue-comment`**
  - Comment to post on issues marked as support requests,
    `{issue-author}` is an optional placeholder
  - Optional, defaults to `:wave: @{issue-author}, we use the issue tracker
    exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. However, this issue
    appears to be a support request. Please use our support channels
    to get help with the project.`
- **`close-issue`**
  - Close issues marked as support requests,
    value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `true`

  - Lock issues marked as support requests,
    value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`
- **`issue-lock-reason`**
  - Reason for locking issues, value must be one
    of `resolved`, `off-topic`, `too heated` or `spam`
  - Optional, defaults to `off-topic`

## Examples

The following workflow will comment on and close issues
marked as support requests.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Available input parameters

This workflow declares all the available input parameters of the action
and their default values. Any of the parameters can be omitted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          support-label: 'support'
          issue-comment: >
            :wave: @{issue-author}, we use the issue tracker exclusively
            for bug reports and feature requests. However, this issue appears
            to be a support request. Please use our support channels
            to get help with the project.
          close-issue: true
          lock-issue: false
          issue-lock-reason: 'off-topic'
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

## Overview

`SLUG` on a variable will

- put the variable content in lower case
- replace any character by `-` except `0-9`, `a-z`, `.`, and `_`
- remove leading `-` characters
- limit the string size to 63 characters
- remove trailing `-` characters

<details>
  <summary>Others <b>Slug-ish</b> commands are available</summary>
  <p>

- `SLUG_URL` on a variable to have a `slug` variable compliant to be used in an URL
  - Like `SLUG` but `.`, and `_` are also replaced by `-`
- `SHORT` on a variable will limit the string size to ~8 characters
  - Useful for _sha_ value
- `<KEY>_PART` on a variable will give a part of a variable defined by a key
  - Like `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER_PART` for the owner part of `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- `<VAR>_CS` on others variables to keep the value case-sensitive
  - Like `GITHUB_REF_SLUG_CS`

Additional enhanced environment variables can be compute to help you around GitHub environment variables.
  </p>
</details>

## Use this action

Add this in your workflow

```yaml
```

<details>
  <summary>Others configurations</summary>
  <p>

- With a prefix

  ```yaml
  - name: Inject slug/short variables
    uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4
    with:
      prefix: CI_
  ```

- With another max length for slug values

  ```yaml
  - name: Inject slug/short variables
    uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4
    with:
      slug-maxlength: 80 # Use 'nolimit' to remove use of a max length (Default to 63)
  ```

- With another length for short values

  ```yaml
  - name: Inject slug/short variables
    uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4
    with:
      short-length: 7 # By default it's up to git to decide, use 8 to have the v3.x behavior
  ```

  **Warning**: If you leave it empty, you need to checkout the source first in order to let git decide the size by itself.
  </p>
</details>

Check for more [examples][examples] (OS usage, URL use, ...)

**Tip:** Use [Dependabot][dependabot] to maintain your `github-slug-action` version updated in your GitHub workflows.

### Migration from previous versions

The short sha length is not the same as previous version.

- `v4` let git configuration decide of it (but you can override it),
- `v3` and before, it's always a length of 8 characters.

So to reproduce previous behavior, use

```yaml
  with:
    short-length: 8 # Same as v3 and before
```

## Available Environment variables

**Note**: If you don't find what you search for, read more about [available `GitHub` variables](docs/github-variables.md), and propose a [new custom variable][custom-variable].

### Enhanced variables

- `GITHUB_REF_NAME` will contains the reference name (branch or tag)
  - based on `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` in a [`pull-request*`][webhooks-and-events] event context,
  - based on `GITHUB_REF` in others event context.

**NOTE:** All enhanced variables are available in all **slug** formats.

## Troubleshooting

### The SHORT variables doesn't have the same lengths as before

Since `v4`, it's git who manage the short variables by using [git rev-parse][git-revparse] behaviour.
The length of a short sha depends of the size of our repository and can differ over time.

To manage that moving length, you can use `short-length` input

- set `7` to reproduce `small repository` behavior
- set `8` to reproduce `v3` behavior

**Warning**: The minimum length is 4, the default is the effective value of the [core.abbrev][git-core-abbrev] configuration variable.

### One of the environment variables doesn't work as intended

[**Note**][naming-conventions]: When you set a custom environment variable, you cannot use any of the default environment variable names. For a complete list of these, see [Default environment variables][default-environment-variables]. **If you attempt to override the value of one of these default environment variables, the assignment is ignored.**

If a variable start to be used as default environment variable, the environment variable may have a different behavior than the expected one.

If this append, the `${{ env.GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE }}` and `$GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE` expression will not works in the same way.

- `${{ env.GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE }}` will serve the behavior of this action,
- `$GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.

Otherwise the two expression will serve the behavior of this action.
This will not occurs if you use the `prefix` input to avoid the issue.

**NOTE:** If detected, the maintainers of this action will choose the best course of action depending of the impact.

#### Known environment variable conflicts

##### GITHUB_REF_NAME

The behavior is the same as the GitHub one except on `pull_request*` workflows ([Ready the full story][issue-104]).

- `${{ env.GITHUB_REF_NAME }}` will serve the behavior of this action,
- `$GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.

On `pull_request*` workflows, the content will be `<PR-number>/merge` instead of the branch name.

A possible workaround is to use `prefix` input

```yaml
  with:
    prefix: CI_
```

Then `${{ env.CI_GITHUB_REF_NAME }}`, and `$CI_GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of this action.
And `$GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.

### An action could not be found at the URI

If your workflow fail on the `Set up job` task with this kind of log

```text
```

If the `GIT_REFERENCE` value is

- `v4.x` or after, the branch don't exists anymore following the [end-of-life for a branch](SECURITY.md#end-of-life-of-a-branch) security process.
- `master`, the branch don't exists anymore, read more about it on the corresponding issue ([EOL issue][issue-15])

Please, use the current major tag `v4` or a version tag (see [releases pages][releases]) in order to fix your workflow.

639,"# setup-bazelisk v2
Set up your GitHub Actions workflow with a specific version of Bazelisk

Note that GitHub Actions includes Bazelisk by default as of <https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/pull/490> so this setup is not necessary unless you want to customize the Bazelisk version, or are running Bazel inside a container.

![Validate \'setup-bazelisk\'](https://github.com/bazelbuild/setup-bazelisk/workflows/Validate%20\'setup-bazelisk\'/badge.svg)

This action sets up Bazelisk for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a version of Bazelisk by version and adding to PATH
- setting up cache for downloaded Bazel versions

# What\'s new

- Updated to the node16 runtime by default
  - This requires a minimum [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.285.0) version of v2.285.0 to run, which is by default available in GHES 3.4 or later.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
```

# Known issues on Windows
* This action doesn\'t work with PowerShell. Make sure to have `shell: bash` in you `run:` steps. ([#3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/setup-bazelisk/issues/3))
* Windows removes one of the slashes (`/`) when two are present (`bazel test //tests/...` becomes `bazel test /tests/...` and fails). ([#4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/setup-bazelisk/issues/4))  
  As a workaround, don\'t have any prefix `//`. Since all runs start at WORKSPACE dir, it should work all the same.

Full workaround example on windows:
```yaml
```

# Replace Environment Variables Action

This action has the simple task of replacing the placeholders of Environment Variables with their values.

For example, you have a README.md file in a template repository, and you want to have a link that points to your
new repository just after you 'fork' it.

So in your template repository, you may have a line like this:

> https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/

And this will be translated (as in this repository) as:

> https://github.com/franzbischoff/replace_envs/

In [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/environment-variables) is the default 
list of environment variables that Github has set.

In addition, you may set your own variables in the workflow YAML file like this:

```yaml
```

That's all it does.

Lastly, just three comments:

- I've created two new variables called `REPOSITORY_ACCOUNT` and `REPOSITORY_ACCOUNT` that is derived from the
 `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` variable, to make it easier to use in some use-cases.
- The changes are by default `pushed` to the repository. If this action is part of a chain of steps, and you want to 
push the changes later, by yourself, you can disable this behavior with the parameter `commit: 'false'`.
- The input and output file can be either a `template -> definitive` or `definitive -> definitive`; this just means that
 the input and output may be the same file. The later attempts to replace, by this action, will 'fail' safely without an
  Error code.

# Why use this action?

I know there are other actions that accomplish the same objective, but:

- This is self-contained (only needs to be preceded by actions/checkout)
- It is plain JavaScript, few lines of code, easy to inspect and see that this action only does what it does.


# Usage

Create a YAML file at `.github/workflows/myworkflow.yml`
> GITHUB_TOKEN must be set, otherwise this action cannot perform changes in your repository.

```yaml
```

641,"# rsync deployments

This GitHub Action deploys files in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to a folder on a server via rsync over ssh. 

This action would usually follow a build/test action which leaves deployable code in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

# Required secrets

This action needs a `DEPLOY_KEY` secret variable. This should be the private key part of an ssh key pair. The public key part should be added to the authorized_keys file on the server that receives the deployment.

# Required inputs

This action requires six inputs:

1. `FLAGS` for any initial/required rsync flags, eg: `-avzr --delete`

2. `EXCLUDES` for any `--exclude` flags and directory pairs, eg: `--exclude .htaccess --exclude /uploads/`. Use `""""` if none required.

3. `USER` for the server user, eg: `deploybot`

4. `HOST` for the deployment target, eg: `myserver.com`

5. `LOCALPATH` for the local path to sync, eg: `/dist/`

5. `REMOTEPATH` for the remote path to sync, eg: `/srv/myapp/public/htdocs/`

# Example usage

```
```

## REMINDER! 

Check your keys. Check your deployment paths. Check your flags. And use at your own risk.

## Usage

Create a new dedicated workflow file:

`.github/workflows/update-gradle-wrapper.yml`

Paste this configuration:

```yaml
```

The action will run every day around midnight, check if a new Gradle version is
available and create a Pull Request to update the Gradle Wrapper script.

Check the detailed description of [action inputs](#action-inputs) and some more
[usage examples](#examples).

## Why should I use this action?

Gradle Wrapper is the recommended way to setup Gradle in your project. The
Wrapper is a script that downloads and invokes a declared Gradle version. By
checking the Wrapper into version control you make the build process more
standardised, easy and reliable.

Maintaining dependencies up-to-date is regarded as a good practice, and the
build system files should be no exception. Unfortunately, often times developers
add the Wrapper to the project repository once and just forget about it.

The Update Gradle Wrapper Action aims to help keeping Gradle projects on GitHub
polished to high standards and to strengthen the software supply chain in the
Gradle ecosystem.

### Hygiene

Gradle is under heavy development, with new releases available every few weeks.
Projects that stick to old Wrapper versions can\'t benefit from the tons of
features and bug fixes being rolled out.

Updating the build system only once or twice per year might become a tedious
task. You will need to walk through longer changelogs and handle any breaking
change. Updating frequently helps do less work, take advantage of new features
earlier and safely drop deprecated functionality.

This action runs automatically at the declared schedule and creates Pull
Requests with detailed information about the version update.

![Pull Request
description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316923/93386801-8af7bc00-f868-11ea-8bfb-3a931a596590.png
""Pull Request with Release Notes"")

### Security

At the hearth of the Gradle Wrapper script is a `.jar` binary blob of executable
code. Checking that blob into a repository makes the developer experience quite
convenient but has important security implications.

A `gradle-wrapper.jar` that has been tampered with could execute or fetch any
arbitrary code. Pull Requests that update the Wrapper are genuinely hard to
review, as GitHub will show an empty binary diff.

![Empty binary
diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316923/93386924-b7abd380-f868-11ea-9f95-74cbf2ffeb80.png
""gradle-wrapper.jar shows an empty diff"")

This action verifies the integrity of the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file being
updated by comparing its SHA-256 checksum against the official checksum value
published by Gradle authors. Moreover, the action configures the Wrapper so that
the Gradle executable itself can be verified once it is downloaded locally.

## Action inputs

This is the list of supported inputs:

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`repo-token`](#repo-token) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope. | No | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| [`reviewers`](#reviewers) | List of users to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |
| [`team-reviewers`](#team-reviewers) | List of teams to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |
| [`labels`](#labels) | List of labels to set on the Pull Request (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |
| [`base-branch`](#base-branch) | Base branch where the action will run and update the Gradle Wrapper. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |
| [`target-branch`](#target-branch) | Branch to create the Pull Request against. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |
| [`paths`](#paths) | List of paths where to search for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |
| [`paths-ignore`](#paths-ignore) | List of paths to be excluded when searching for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |
| [`set-distribution-checksum`](#set-distribution-checksum) | Whether to set the `distributionSha256Sum` property. | No | `true` |
| [`release-channel`](#release-channel) | Which Gradle release channel to use: either `stable` or `release-candidate`. | No | `stable` |
| [`merge-method`](#merge-method) | Which merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). Valid values include `MERGE`, `REBASE`, or `SQUASH`.  If unset, automerge will not be enabled on opened PRs. | No | (unset) No auto-merge |

---

### `repo-token`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `repo-token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope. | No | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

Set the authorisation token used by the action to perform tasks through the
GitHub API and to execute authenticated git commands.

If empty, it defaults to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that is installed in your
repository, which is equivalent to the following configuration:

```yaml
```

Note that, when using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, Pull Requests created by the Update
Gradle Wrapper action cannot trigger any workflow run in your repository. This
is a restriction of GitHub Actions to avoid accidentally creating recursive
workflow runs ([read
more](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)).

So, for example, if you have any `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflow that
runs CI checks on Pull Requests, they won\'t be triggered if the `repo-token` is
left empty or if you set it to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The recommended workaround is to [create a Personal Access Token
(PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with `repo` scope and add it [as a
secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
into your repository. Then, set the `repo-token` to access your secret PAT:

```yaml
```

Read this [paragraph](#running-ci-workflows-in-pull-requests-created-by-the-action) for more details on the topic.

---

### `reviewers`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reviewers` | List of users to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |

Request a review from these GitHub usernames (notifications will be triggered).

For example, use a comma-separated list:

```yaml
```

or add each reviewer on a different line (no comma needed):

```yaml
```

Note that if you\'re using a Personal Access Token (PAT) as `repo-token` you cannot request a review from the user that the PAT belongs to.

---

### `team-reviewers`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `team-reviewers` | List of teams to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |

Request a review from these teams (notifications will be triggered).

For example, use a comma-separated list:

```yaml
```

or add each team on a different line (no comma needed):

```yaml
```

Note that you might need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) as `repo-token` in order to request a review from a team in your organisation.

---

### `labels`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `labels` | List of labels to set on the Pull Request (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |

Add custom labels to the Pull Request.

For example, use a comma-separated list:

```yaml
```

or add each label on a different line (no comma needed):

```yaml
```

Label names can include spaces. Note that the action will create a label if it doesn\'t already exist within your organisation.

---

### `base-branch`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base-branch` | Base branch where the action will run and update the Gradle Wrapper. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |

The name of the branch used as a base when running the update process. The action will switch (i.e. `git checkout`) to this branch before updating the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file. By default the repository\'s ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" is used (most commonly `master`).

```yaml
```

---

### `target-branch`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target-branch` | Branch to create Pull Requests against. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |

The name of the branch to push changes into. By default the repository\'s ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" is used (most commonly `master`).

For example:

```yaml
```

---

### `paths`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `paths` | List of paths where to search for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |

By default all Gradle Wrapper files in the source tree will be autodiscovered and considered for update. Use `paths` to provide a specific list of paths where to look for `gradle-wrapper.jar`.

For example, use a comma-separated list:

```yaml
```

or add each path on a different line (no comma needed):

```yaml
```

This input accepts glob patterns that use characters like `*` and `**`, for more information see [GitHub\'s cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet).

`paths` and `paths-ignore` can be used together. `paths` is always evaluated before `paths-ignore`, look at [this example](#using-paths-and-paths-ignore-together).

---

### `paths-ignore`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `paths-ignore` | List of paths to be excluded when searching for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |

By default all Gradle Wrapper files in the source tree will be autodiscovered and considered for update. Use `paths-ignore` to specify paths that should be ignored during scan.

For example, use a comma-separated list:

```yaml
```

or add each path on a different line (no comma needed):

```yaml
```

This input accepts glob patterns that use characters like `*` and `**`, for more information see [GitHub\'s cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet).

`paths` and `paths-ignore` can be used together. `paths-ignore` is always evaluated after `paths`, look at [this example](#using-paths-and-paths-ignore-together).

---

### `set-distribution-checksum`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `set-distribution-checksum` | Whether to set the `distributionSha256Sum` property. | No | `true` |

The Gradle Wrapper provides a way to increase security against attackers
tampering with the Gradle distribuition file you download locally.
If the `distributionSha256Sum` property is added to
`gradle-wrapper.properties`, Gradle will report a build failure in case the
specified checksum doesn\'t match the checksum of the distribution downloaded
from server (this is only performed once, the first time you download a new
Gradle version).

The Update Gradle Wrapper action sets the expected checksum for you. If you
want to disable this behaviour change the `set-distribution-checksum` input
to `false`.

It is not recommended to change this value unless you\'ve got a very specific
need (e.g. [Android Studio warnings](#android-studio-warning-about-distributionsha256sum)).

For example:

```yaml
```

---

### `release-channel`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `release-channel` | Which release channel to use: `stable` or `release-candidate`. | No | `stable` |

Gradle\'s release channel used to update. By default `stable` is used which corresponds to the latest stable release.
Alternatively, `release-candidate` can be used to update to the most recent release candidate.

For example:

```yaml
```
### `merge-method`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`merge-method`](#merge-method) | Which merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). Valid values include `MERGE`, `REBASE`, or `SQUASH`.  If unset, automerge will not be enabled on opened PRs. | No | (unset) No auto-merge |

The merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). By default auto-merge will not be enabled; set this to one of the valid merge methods to enable auto-merge.

For example:

```yaml
```
### `pr-title-template`

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pr-title-template` | The template to use for the title of the pull request created by this action | No | `Update Gradle Wrapper from %sourceVersion% to %targetVersion%` |

This input is used for the title of the pull request created by this action. This allows, for example, for better integration into repositories which make use of commit message patterns like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

`%sourceVersion%` and `%targetVersion%` will be replaced by the current/old and the new version of the Gradle Wrapper
respectively.

There are cases in which the source version of the Gradle Wrapper can not be determined successfully. In such cases, the string \'undefined\' will be used to replace the source version placeholder.

For example:

```yaml
```

## Examples

### Scheduling action execution

You should run this action on a dedicated workflow using a `schedule` trigger
event:

```yaml
```

or

```yaml
```

Use the [POSIX cron
syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)
to specify your preferred time or frequency (tip: check your value is correct
with [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/examples.html)).

It is not recommended to run the action more frequently than once a day.

### Targeting a custom branch

The action will create Pull Requests against the ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" of your repository (say, `master` or any other branch you\'ve configured).

If you want Pull Requests to be created against a non-default branch use the `target-branch` input:

```yaml
```

### Updating to the latest Release Candidate version

The action supports more Gradle release channels. By default, when the action runs it will check for the latest `stable` release. If your project depends on the release candidate version of Gradle, use `release-channel` to configure which release information to download:

```yaml
```

### Ignoring subprojects folders with `paths-ignore`

There are cases where your repository contains folders for projects or subprojects that need to be kept at an older Gradle version.

If you want to ignore such files when the action runs, use `paths-ignore` to configure project paths that contain Gradle Wrapper files that should not be updated.

```yaml
```

### Using `paths` and `paths-ignore` together

`paths` and `paths-ignore` works as allowlist and blocklist systems. The evaluation rule is as follows:

- the source tree is searched for all `gradle-wrapper.jar` files and the list is passed to the next step
- if `paths` is not empty, the paths that match the specified patterns are passed to the next step
- if `paths-ignore` is not empty, the paths that match the specified patterns are removed from the list

For example, the following configuration will search for Gradle Wrapper files in the `sub-project` directory and its subdirectories, but not in the `sub-project/examples` directory.

```yaml
```

## FAQ

### Running CI workflows in Pull Requests created by the action

By default, if the `repo-token` input is left empty or if you set it to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, Pull Requests created by the Update Gradle Wrapper action do not trigger any other workflow. So, for example, if you have any `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflow that runs CI checks on Pull Requests, they won\'t normally be triggered.

This is a restriction imposed by GitHub Actions to avoid accidentally creating recursive workflow runs ([read more](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)).

Here is what you can do to trigger additional workflows:

- Manual trigger: when you use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` the Pull Request won\'t run any of the configured workflows, but you can manually close and immediately reopen the Pull Request to trigger the `on: pull_request` workflows.

- Use a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token): create a PAT with the `repo` scope and add it [as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) into your repository. Then configure the [`repo-token`](#repo-token) input to use such encrypted secret. Note that the Pull Request author will be set to the GitHub user that the PAT belongs to: as Pull Request author, this user cannot be assigned as reviewer and cannot approve it.

- Use a Personal Access Token of a dedicated account: use a PAT that belongs to a machine account with collaborator access to your repository.

### Android Studio warning about `distributionSha256Sum`

You might get a warning message in Android Studio that looks like this:

> It is not fully supported to define distributionSha256Sum in gradle-wrapper.properties.

This refers to the presence of the `distributionSha256Sum` property into
`gradle-wrapper.properties`, which Update Gradle Wrapper action sets by default
to increase security against the risk of the Gradle distribution being tampered
with.

It is totally safe to disable the warning in Android Studio, just choose the option:

> Use ""..."" as checksum for https://.../gradle-6.6.1-bin.zip and sync project

On the other hand, if for some reason you prefer to avoid the
`distributionSha256Sum` property being set automatically by the action use the
[`set-distribution-checksum`](#set-distribution-checksum):

```yaml
```

## Debugging

Debug logs are disabled by default in GitHub actions. To see any debug output
in the workflow execution logs, [add a
secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with value `true` in your repository.

![Adding a
secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316923/93029810-598bb000-f61e-11ea-914d-822fb44b2128.png

646,"# Has Changed Path - GitHub Action

<p align=""left"">
  <a href=""https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/actions""><img alt=""has-changed-path status"" src=""https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/workflows/unit-tests/badge.svg""></a>
</p>

This action outputs whether a path or combination of paths has changed in the previous commit.

It solves a common issue among monorepo setups: conditional actions. Deploying a project that did not change in the previous commit could be a waste of time and resources.

With this action, **you know if a deployment or any other job needs to run based on the changed paths of the most recent commit.**

It differs from [GitHub\'s paths](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) as our action is meant to be used inside your job steps, not at the root of your workflow file (see [this issue](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Path-filtering-for-jobs-and-steps/td-p/33617)).

My recommendation is to put this action in a workflow that runs on every push to `master`.

## Inputs

- `paths` (required): Path to detect changes. It\'s possible to pass one path, a combination or a wildcard. Valid options include: `packages/front`, `packages/front packages/shared`, `packages/**/tests`. See workflow examples below for more information.

## Outputs

- `changed`: boolean indicating if the paths changed at the latest commit

## Example workflows

### Important info:

Notice that **you must configure `fetch-depth` in your `actions/checkout@v2`**. That\'s because their default option now is to fetch only the latest commit instead of all history ([more info](https://github.com/actions/checkout))

If you want to fetch all history, pass `fetch-depth: 0`.

For monorepo packages, where history tends to be larger than single repos, it may take a while fetching all of it. That\'s why we used `fetch-depth: 100` in the examples. It will fetch the latest 100 commits.

### Detecting a simple one-path change:

```yaml
```

### Detecting changes in multiple paths:

Useful when you have dependencies between packages (eg. `/common` package used in `/front` and `/server`).
Below, the output would be truthy for any given change inside `packages/front` **or** `packages/common`.

```yaml
```

### Detecting a one-path change with checkout multiple repos:

```yaml
```

## How it works?

The action itself is pretty simple - take a look at [`src/hasChanged.js`](https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/blob/master/src/hasChanged.js) ;) .

Basically, we compare the latest HEAD with the previous one using `git diff` command. This allows us to effectively detect changes in most cases (squashed merges and merges with merge commit).

The algorithm works very similar with [Netlify\'s default way](https://community.netlify.com/t/monorepo-and-long-builds/7234/2) for detecting changes in monorepo builds.

## Why markdown-autodocs
To make your repo more appealing and useful you need to provide example code snippets in your README.md. Manually copy and pasting each code snippet in their respective places in your README would be inefficient and time-consuming.

This problem can be solved using <b>markdown-autodocs</b> a GitHub Action that automatically generates & updates markdown content (like your README.md) from external or remote files. You need to add markers in your README.md that will tell markdown-autodocs where to insert the code snippet.

## Features
*   <b>Code block:</b> Insert code snippet in your markdown file from external or remote files.
*   <b>JSON to HTML table:</b> Insert HTML Table in your markdown file by converting JSON file contents to HTML table.
*   <b>Github Workflow Artifacts table:</b> Insert the Github workflow artifacts table in your markdown file by getting the latest artifacts for a workflow run.

## Examples

### CODE Block

Get code from an external file or URL and insert it in your markdown.

**Options:**
* `src`: The relative path to the code to pull in, or the `URL` where the raw code lives
* `lines` (optional): a range with lines of code which will then be replaced with code from the file. The line range should be defined as: ""lines=*startLine*-*EndLine*"" (for example: ""lines=22-44""). Please see the example below
* `syntax` (optional): Syntax will be inferred by fileType if not specified
* `header` (optional): Will add header comment to code snippet. Useful for pointing to relative source directory or adding live doc links

Options are concatenated via the ```&``` sign.
For example ```(CODE:src=readme.md&lines=10-20)```

648,"# Sticky Pull Request Comment

Create a comment on a pull request, if it exists update that comment.
This library runs with GitHub Actions. If you feel that the example grammar below is not friendly enough, we recommend reading [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) first.

## Usage

### Basic

You need to add permissions for this tool.

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

### Keep more than one comment

In some cases, different actions may require different comments. The header allows you to maintain comments independently.

````yaml
        ```
        ${{ env.test_result }}
        ```
````

### Append after comment every time it runs

````yaml
        ```
        ${{ env.test_result }}
        ```
````

### Comment from push

If for some reason, triggering on pr is not possible, you can use push.

```yaml
```

### Read comment from a file

```yaml
```

### Delete the previous comment and add a comment at the end

```yaml
```

### Delete previous comment

```yaml
```

### Hide the previous comment and add a comment at the end

```yaml
```

### Hide previous comment

```yaml
```

### Error: Resource not accessible by integration

This tool requires write permission, and that message means the requester does not have enough permission.
Recently, GitHub sets permissions conservatively for newly created repositories. If it\'s a newly created repository, check your Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions, and make sure to enable read and write permissions.

Then, you can specify permissions for the job like this:

```yaml
```

For more detailed information about permissions, you can read from the link below:
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs>

## Inputs

### `header`

**Optional** Header to determine if the comment should be updated (it is not shown to users). It can be used when you want to add multiple comments independently to a given object.

### `append`

**Optional** Indicate if new comment messages should be appended to previous comment message. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.

### `recreate`

**Optional** Indicate if previous comment should be removed before creating a new comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.

### `delete`

**Optional** Delete a previously created comment. Use `header` to point to which comment you want to delete. Only `true` is allowed (i.e. delete this option if you don\'t need it).

### `only_create`

**Optional** Only create a new comment if there is no existing one, otherwise do nothing. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it. This options has higher priority than hide_and_recreate, hide.

### `only_update`

**Optional** Only update a exist comment if there is existing one, otherwise do nothing. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it.

### `hide`

**Optional** Hide a previously created comment. Use `header` to point to which comment you want to delete. Only `true` is allowed (i.e. delete this option if you don\'t need it).

### `hide_classify`

**Optional** The reasons a piece of content can be reported or minimized. SPAM, ABUSE, OFF_TOPIC, OUTDATED, DUPLICATE, RESOLVED are available. default is OUTDATED.

### `hide_details`

**Optional** Hide summary tags in the previously created comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it.

### `hide_and_recreate`

**Optional** Indicate if previous comment should be removed before creating a new comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.

### `message`

**Optional** Comment message

### `path`

**Optional** Path to file containing comment message

### `number`

**Optional** Pull request number for push event. Note that this has a **lower priority** than the number of a pull_request event.

### `owner`

**Optional** Another repository owner, If not set, the current repository owner is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.

### `repo`

**Optional** Another repository name. Of limited use on GitHub enterprise. If not set, the current repository is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.

### `ignore_empty`

**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, no comment will be posted if the comment body is empty. Note that enabling this will prevent comment hiding & deletion from working when the body is empty.

### `skip_unchanged`

**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, recreating or updating a comment will be skipped if the new message is identical to the current message.

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**Optional**, You can set [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) here. If not set, this will use `${{ github.token }}`.

## Outputs

### `previous_comment_id`

ID of previous comment, if found

### `created_comment_id`

ID of newly created comment, if any

# Context and motivation

Get Workflow Origin is an action that provides information about the pull requests that triggered the
workflow for the `pull_request` and `pull_request_review` events or for the `workflow_run` event
that is triggered by one of those events.

Often in those events you want to get more information about the source run than the
one provided directly via GitHub context.

For example, you would like to know what is the merge commit generated by pull request in case
the workflow is triggered by a pull request, or labels associated with the Pull Request.

This action provides outputs that give that information. You should add this action as first
one in your workflow and then you will be able to use those outputs using \'needs\' dependency.

The `sourceRunId` input should not be specified in case of the `pull_request` event, but it should
be set to `${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}` in case of the `workflow_run` event.

## Development environment

It is highly recommended tu use [pre commit](https://pre-commit.com). The pre-commits
installed via pre-commit tool handle automatically linting (including automated fixes) as well
as building and packaging Javascript index.js from the main.ts Typescript code, so you do not have
to run it yourself.

This action sets up a `base`
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment by one of:

- locating the `conda` installation [bundled] with the available runners and
  available in `$CONDA`
- installing a specific (or latest) version of
  - [Miniconda3][miniconda-repo]
  - [Miniforge][miniforge-releases] (or Mambaforge)
  - any [constructor]-based installer by or URL or filesystem path

A `conda-build-version` or `mamba-version` may be provided to install into
`base`.

The base `condabin/` folder is added to `$PATH` and shell integration is
initialized across all platforms.

By default, this action will then create, and _activate_, an environment by one
of:

- creating a mostly-empty `test` environment, containing only the latest
  `python-version` and its dependencies
- creating an `test` environment described in a given `environment-file`:
  - an `environment.yml`-like file (which can be patched with `python-version`)
    - the patched environment will be cleaned up unless
      `clean-patched-environment-file: false` is given
  - a [lockfile](#example-7-lockfiles)

This action correctly handles activation of environments and offers the
possibility of automatically activating the `test` environment on all shells.

## Environment activation

This action will by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_
activate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the
`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the
`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.

## Inputs and outputs

For a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see
[action.yml](action.yml).

### Use a different environment name or path

You can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path
by setting the `activate-environment` input option.

```yaml
```

This will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is
the path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""
Miniconda installation.

> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will
>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology. Use this to
>   avoid ""path too long""-style errors, especially on Windows.
> - Self-hosted runners can emulate the ""bundled"" Miniconda approach by
>   pre-installing a [constructor]-based installer and ensuring `$CONDA` is set
>   prior to starting `setup-miniconda`

### Activate `base` environment

If your specific workflow still needs to activate and use `base` you will need
to do **both** of:

- set `activate-environment` to an empty string
- set `auto-activate-base` to `true`

```yaml
```

## Usage examples

### Example 1: Basic usage

This example shows how to set a basic python workflow with conda using the
crossplatform available shells: `bash` and `pwsh`. On this example an
environment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`
installed for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.

```yaml
```

### Example 2: Other shells

This example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating
systems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version
available and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.

```yaml
```

### Example 3: Other options

This example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for
easier creation of test/build environments and
[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration
management. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an
environment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment
before activating the `anaconda-client-env`.

```yaml
```

### Example 4: Conda options

This example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The
priority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will
result in:

- conda-forge
- spyder-ide
- defaults

```yaml
```

### Example 5: Custom installer

Any installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)
which includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not
yet supported by Miniconda. For more, see [Example 10](#example-10-miniforge).

> Notes:
>
> - Installer downloads are cached based on their full URL: adding some
>   non-functional salt to the URL will prevent this behavior, e.g.
>   `#${{ github.run_number }}`

```yaml
```

### Example 6: Mamba

Experimental! Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.
`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires
you specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest
priority.

> Notes:
>
> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it
>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)
>   with `use-mamba: true`.

```yaml
```

### Example 7: Lockfiles

`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit
environment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution
step altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to
reproduce the environment.

This means explicitly-defined environments...

- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:
  - channels are not queried for their repo data
  - no solver is run
- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain
  platform/architecture information
- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable

This approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow
that runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.

[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock
[explicit-spec]:
  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments

```yaml
```

### Example 10: Miniforge

[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) provides a number of
alternatives to Miniconda, built from the ground up with `conda-forge` packages
and with only `conda-forge` in its default channels.

If only `miniforge-version` is provided, `Miniforge3` will be used.

```yaml
```

In addition to `Miniforge3` with `conda` and `CPython`, for each of its many
supported platforms and architectures, additional variants including
`Mambaforge` (which comes pre-installed `mamba` in addition to `conda` on all
platforms) and `Miniforge-pypy3`/`Mamabaforge-pypy3` (which replace `CPython`
with `pypy3` on Linux/MacOS) are available.

```yaml
```

### Example 11: Alternative Architectures

In addition to the default 64-bit builds of Miniconda, 32-bit versions are
available for Windows. Note that although some x86 builds are available for
Linux and MacOS, these are too old (<4.6) to be supported by this action.

```yaml
```

## Caching

### Caching packages

If you want to enable package caching for conda you can use the
[cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) using `~/conda_pkgs_dir` as
path for conda packages.

The cache will use a explicit key for restoring and saving the cache.

This can be based in the contents of files like:

- `setup.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `environment.yml`

```yaml
```

If you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then
you may want to
[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),
as they are not included in the conda package cache.

### Caching environments

The first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without specifying
a environment file.

```yaml
```

It\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies of
package versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. Here we ensure
that this happens by adding the current date to the cache key. You can remove
the ""Get Date"" step below if you use a resolved environment file product of
`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.

```yaml
```

Keep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the same
as hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves the
dependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages available on
the channels at installation time. Since packages are updated all the time, you
will not see these changes reflected in the cache until the key gets updated by
date.

**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally but
fail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache manually to
see if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved environment file.**

Finally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache does
not exist.

```yaml
```

### Use a default shell

Assuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -el {0}` to
every single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all
the steps.

By adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -el {0}`, all steps in
the job will default to that value.

For other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default
value. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.

More information the
[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).

```yaml
```

## IMPORTANT

- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -el {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are
  executed with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated
  on bash profile files made by `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)
  and
  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).
- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly
  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed
  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by
  `conda init bash`. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be
  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are
  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag
  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which
  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See
  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).
- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`
  option to `true`.
- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda
  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a
  version of conda compatible with the option.
- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the
  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide
  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was
  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts
  and result in very long install times.
- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`. Please use `bash`.

652,"install-crystal
===============

[GitHub Action][] to **install [Crystal][] programming language** and [Shards][] package manager.

Works on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows.

### Quickstart

**[Configurator][]**: get a pre-made config for your exact use case!

## Examples

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

[Find usages in the wild!](https://github.com/search?l=YAML&q=%22oprypin%2Finstall-crystal%22&type=Code)

Alternatively, you can use the container-based approach [as in the starter workflow][crystal-starter] (without this action), but the advantage here is the unified approach to installation across 3 systems. [Using a custom container has disadvantages on its own, too](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t//2837).

## Usage

### Inputs

 *   *  **`crystal: 1.1.0`**, **`crystal: 1.2`**

        Install a particular release of Crystal (if the full version is specified), or the latest patch version of a release series.

     *  **`crystal: latest`** (default)

        Install the latest released version of Crystal.

     *  **`crystal: nightly`**

        Install Crystal from the latest continuous build on [crystal.git][] master.

     *  **`crystal: ""branch:foo/bar""`**

        Install Crystal from the latest maintenance build on [crystal.git][] branch specified after `branch:`.

 *   *  **`shards: true`** (default)

        Ensure that *some* released version of [Shards][] is available.
        This uses the build that\'s bundled with Crystal\'s releases. Other options are slower, as building Shards is a necessary step then.

     *  **`shards: false`**

        Ensure that `shards` executable is *not* available.

     *  **`shards: latest`**

        Build and install the latest released version of Shards.

     *  **`shards: 0.14.0`**, **`shards: 0.16`**

        Build and install a particular release of Shards (if the full version is specified), or the latest patch version of a release series.

653,"# setup-smalltalkCI

This GitHub Action sets up [smalltalkCI] for testing Smalltalk projects.

## Usage

### Basic

```yaml
```

### Testing Different Smalltalk Images

```yaml
```

### Testing Different Smalltalk Images with Different Configurations
```yaml
```

### Use a different branch or fork

```yaml
```


### Pharos-specific: Registering Repository in Iceberg  

Registering a repository in Iceberg allows developers to access the directory of the repository regardless of where it is located in the file system.
This eases access to non-Smalltalk resources.
To register the repository in Iceberg, you need to add `#registerInIceberg : true` to your `.smalltalk.ston` file.

```smalltalk
```

However, Iceberg requires the full commit history.
`actions/checkout` provides by default only the latest one.
Therefore we need to use an option to get all commits.
(Only available for Pharo 7 and later version at this time). 

```yaml
```

## Example

Following setup does not work in workflows triggered by pull request from forked repository.
If that\'s fine for you, using this action is as simple as:

```yaml
```

## Recommended setup for public repositories

Workflows triggered by pull requests from forked repositories are executed with read-only token and therefore can\'t create check runs.
To workaround this security restriction, it\'s required to use two separate workflows:
1. `CI` runs in the context of the PR head branch with the read-only token. It executes the tests and uploads test results as a build artifact
2. `Test Report` runs in the context of the repository main branch with read/write token. It will download test results and create reports

The second workflow will only run after it has been merged into your default branch (typically `main` or `master`), it won\'t run in a PR unless after the workflow file is part of that branch.

**PR head branch:**  *.github/workflows/ci.yml*
```yaml
```
**default branch:**  *.github/workflows/test-report.yml*
```yaml
```

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Output parameters
| Name       | Description              |
| :--        | :--                      |
| conclusion | `success` or `failure`   |
| passed     | Count of passed tests    |
| failed     | Count of failed tests    |
| skipped    | Count of skipped tests   |
| time       | Test execution time [ms] |

## Supported formats

<details>
  <summary>dart-json</summary>

Test run must be configured to use [JSON](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md#reporter) reporter.
You can configure it in `dart_test.yaml`:

```yml
```

Or with CLI arguments:

[`dart test --file-reporter=""json:test-results.json""`](https://pub.dev/packages/test)

For more information see:
- [test package](https://pub.dev/packages/test)
- [test configuration](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>dotnet-trx</summary>

Test execution must be configured to produce *Visual Studio Test Results* files (TRX).
To get test results in TRX format you can execute your tests with CLI arguments:

`dotnet test --logger ""trx;LogFileName=test-results.trx""`

Or you can configure TRX test output in `*.csproj` or `Directory.Build.props`:
```xml
```

Supported testing frameworks:
- [xUnit](https://xunit.net/)
- [NUnit](https://nunit.org/)
- [MSTest](https://github.com/Microsoft/testfx-docs)

For more information see [dotnet test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test#examples)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>flutter-json</summary>

Test run must be configured to use [JSON](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md#reporter) reporter.
You can configure it in `dart_test.yaml`:
```yml
```

Or with (undocumented) CLI argument:

`flutter test --machine > test-results.json`


According to documentation `dart_test.yaml` should be at the root of the package, next to the package\'s pubspec.
On current `stable` and `beta` channels it doesn\'t work, and you have to put `dart_test.yaml` inside your `test` folder.
On `dev` channel, it\'s already fixed.

For more information see:
- [test package](https://pub.dev/packages/test)
- [test configuration](https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/test/doc/configuration.md)

- [unit testing introduction](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>java-junit (Experimental)</summary>

Support for [JUnit](https://Junit.org/) XML is experimental - should work but it was not extensively tested.
To have code annotations working properly, it\'s required your directory structure matches the package name.
This is due to the fact Java stack traces don\'t contain a full path to the source file.
Some heuristic was necessary to figure out the mapping between the line in the stack trace and an actual source file.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>jest-Junit</summary>

[JEST](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework support requires the usage of [jest-Junit](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-Junit) reporter.
It will create test results in Junit XML format which can be then processed by this action.
You can use the following example configuration in `package.json`:
```json
```

Configuration of `uniqueOutputName`, `suiteNameTemplate`, `classNameTemplate`, `titleTemplate` is important for proper visualization of test results.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>mocha-json</summary>

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework support requires:
- Mocha version [v7.2.0](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/releases/tag/v7.2.0) or higher
- Usage of [json](https://mochajs.org/#json) reporter.

You can use the following example configuration in `package.json`:
```json
```

Test processing might fail if any of your tests write anything on standard output.
Mocha, unfortunately, doesn\'t have the option to store `json` output directly to the file, and we have to rely on redirecting its standard output.
There is a work in progress to fix it: [mocha#4607](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4607)
</details>

## GitHub limitations

Unfortunately, there are some known issues and limitations caused by GitHub API:

- Test report (i.e. Check Run summary) is markdown text. No custom styling or HTML is possible.
- Maximum report size is 65535 bytes. Input parameters `list-suites` and `list-tests` will be automatically adjusted if max size is exceeded.
- Test report can\'t reference any additional files (e.g. screenshots). You can use `actions/upload-artifact@v2` to upload them and inspect them manually.
- Check Runs are created for specific commit SHA. It\'s not possible to specify under which workflow test report should belong if more
  workflows are running for the same SHA. Thanks to this GitHub ""feature"" it\'s possible your test report will appear in an unexpected place in GitHub UI.
  For more information, see [#67](https://github.com/dorny/test-reporter/issues/67).

657,"# cosign-installer GitHub Action

This action enables you to sign and verify container images using `cosign`.
`cosign-installer` verifies the integrity of the `cosign` release during installation.

For a quick start guide on the usage of `cosign`, please refer to https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start.
For available `cosign` releases, see https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases.

## Usage

This action currently supports GitHub-provided Linux, macOS and Windows runners (self-hosted runners may not work).

Add the following entry to your Github workflow YAML file:

```yaml
```

Example using a pinned version:

```yaml
```

Example using the default version:

```yaml
```

If you want to install cosign from its main version by using \'go install\' under the hood, you can set \'cosign-release\' as \'main\'. Once you did that, cosign will be installed via \'go install\' which means that please ensure that go is installed.

Example of installing cosign via go install:

```yaml
```

This action does not need any GitHub permission to run, however, if your workflow needs to update, create or perform any
action against your repository, then you should change the scope of the permission appropriately.

For example, if you are using the `gcr.io` as your registry to push the images you will need to give the `write` permission
to the `packages` scope.

Example of a simple workflow:

```yaml
```

### Optional Inputs
The following optional inputs:

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cosign-release` | `cosign` version to use instead of the default. |
| `install-dir` | directory to place the `cosign` binary into instead of the default (`$HOME/.cosign`). |
| `use-sudo` | set to `true` if `install-dir` location requires sudo privs. Defaults to false. |

</p>

This action sets by [redis](https://redis.io/) database for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a version of redis
- start redis-server

## Motivation

- GitHub Actions supports Docker services, and there is the official [redis image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). but it works on only Linux.
- Some test utils for redis (such as [Test::RedisServer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::RedisServer)) requires redis-server installed on the local host.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
```

Matrix Testing:
```yaml
```

## Configuration

### redis-version

The version of Redis.
The `redis-version` input supports the following syntax:

- `latest`: the latest version of stable Redis
- `6`, `5`, `4`: major versions
- `6.2`, `6.0`: minor versions
- `6.2.0`, `6.2.1`: patch versions

The default value is `latest`.
The actions supports only stable versions.

### redis-port

The port number that `redis-server` listens.
The default value is `6379`.

### redis-tls-port

The port number that `redis-server` listens TLS connections.
The default value is `0` and TLS is disabled.

### auto-start

If the `auto-start` is `true`, the action starts `redis-server` as a daemon.
If it is `false`, the action just install Redis commands, doesn\'t start `redis-server`.
It is a boolean value, valid values are `true` or `false`.
The default value is `true`.

### redis-conf

Extra configurations for `redis.conf`.
See [Redis configuration](https://redis.io/topics/config).

## Outputs

### redis-port

The port number that `redis-server` listens.

```yaml
```

### redis-unix-socket

The unix domain socket path that `redis-server` listens.

```yaml
```

### redis-tls-port

The port number that `redis-server` listens TLS connections.

### redis-tls-port

The directory path for TLS sample certificates/keys.

```yaml
```

## Why

Compromised workflows, dependencies, and build tools typically make outbound calls to exfiltrate credentials, or may tamper source code, dependencies, or artifacts during the build.

Harden-Runner GitHub Action monitors process, file, and network activity to:

Read this [case study](https://infosecwriteups.com/detecting-malware-packages-in-github-actions-7b93a9985635) on how Harden-Runner detected malicious packages in the NPM registry.

## How

1. Add `step-security/harden-runner` to your GitHub Actions workflow file as the first step in each job.

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: step-security/harden-runner@8ca2b8b2ece13480cda6dacd3511b49857a23c09 # v2.5.1
       with:
         egress-policy: audit
   ```

2. In the workflow logs and the job markdown summary, you will see a link to security insights and recommendations.

    <p align=""left"">
      <img src=""images/buildlog1.png"" alt=""Link in build log"" >
    </p>

3. Click on the link ([example link](https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/microsoft/msquic/actions/runs/5577342236)). You will see a process monitor view of network and file events correlated with each step of the job.

    <p align=""left"">
      <img src=""images/Insights4.png"" alt=""Insights from harden-runner"" >
    </p>

4. Under the insights section, you\'ll find a Recommended Policy. You can either update your workflow file with this Policy, or alternatively, use the [Policy Store](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/how-tos/block-egress-traffic#2-add-the-policy-using-the-policy-store) to apply the policy without modifying the workflow file.

    <p align=""left"">
      <img src=""images/rec-policy1.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >
    </p>

## Support for ARC and Private Repositories

Actions Runner Controller (ARC) and Private repositories are supported with a commercial license. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/stepsecurity-platform/billing) for more details.

Install the [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) to use Harden-Runner GitHub Action for `Private` repositories.

- If you use Harden-Runner GitHub Action in a private repository, the generated insights URL is NOT public.
- You need to authenticate first to access insights URL for private repository. Only those who have access to the repository can view it.
- [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) only needs `actions: read` permissions on your repositories.

Read this [case study on how Kapiche uses Harden-Runner](https://www.stepsecurity.io/case-studies/kapiche/) to improve software supply chain security in their private repositories.

## Features at a glance

For details, check out the documentation at https://docs.stepsecurity.io

### \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa6 Restrict egress traffic to allowed endpoints

Once allowed endpoints are set in the policy in the workflow file, or in the [Policy Store](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/how-tos/block-egress-traffic#2-add-the-policy-using-the-policy-store)

- Harden-Runner blocks egress traffic at the DNS (Layer 7) and network layers (Layers 3 and 4).
- It blocks DNS exfiltration, where attacker tries to send data out using DNS resolution
- Blocks outbound traffic using IP tables
- Wildcard domains are supported, e.g. you can add `*.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443` to the allowed list, and egress traffic will be allowed to `eastus.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443` and `westus.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443`.

<p align=""left"">
  <img src=""images/block-outbound-call.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >
</p>

### \xf0\x9f\x95\xb5\xef\xb8\x8f Detect tampering of source code during build

Harden-Runner monitors file writes and can detect if a file is overwritten.

- Source code overwrite is not expected in a release build
- All source code files are monitored, which means even changes to IaC files (Kubernetes manifest, Terraform) are detected
- You can enable notifications to get one-time alert when source code is overwritten

<p align=""left"">
  <img src=""images/fileoverwrite.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >
</p>

### \xf0\x9f\x9a\xab Run your job without sudo access

GitHub-hosted runner uses passwordless sudo for running jobs.

- This means compromised build tools or dependencies can install attack tools
- If your job does not need sudo access, you see a policy
  recommendation to disable sudo in the insights page
- When you set `disable-sudo` to `true`, the job steps run without sudo access to the Ubuntu VM

### \xf0\x9f\x94\x94 Get security alerts

Install the [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) to get security alerts.

- Email and Slack notifications are supported
- Notifications are sent when outbound traffic is blocked or source code is overwritten
- Notifications are not repeated for the same alert for a given workflow

## Discussions

If you have questions or ideas, please use [discussions](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/discussions). For support for ARC and Private repositories, email info@stepsecurity.io.

## How does it work?

For GitHub-hosted runners, Harden-Runner GitHub Action downloads and installs the StepSecurity Agent.

- The code to monitor file, process, and network activity is in the Agent.
- The agent is written in Go and is open source at https://github.com/step-security/agent
- The agent\'s build is reproducible. You can view the steps to reproduce the build [here](http://app.stepsecurity.io/github/step-security/agent/releases/latest)

## Limitations for GitHub-Hosted Runners

1. Only Ubuntu VM is supported. Windows and MacOS GitHub-hosted runners are not supported. There is a discussion about that [here](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/discussions/121).
2. Harden-Runner is not supported when [job is run in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) as it needs sudo access on the Ubuntu VM to run. It can be used to monitor jobs that use containers to run steps. The limitation is if the entire job is run in a container. That is not common for GitHub Actions workflows, as most of them run directly on `ubuntu-latest`.

  Only publishes if the version number in `package.json` differs from the latest on npm.

- \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0 **Configurable**<br>
  Customize the version-checking behavior, the registry URL, and path of your package.

- \xf0\x9f\x94\x90 **Secure**<br>
  Keeps your npm authentication token secret. Doesn\'t read from or write to `~/.npmrc`.

- \xe2\x9a\xa1 **Fast**<br>
  100% JavaScript (which is faster than Docker) and bundled to optimize loading time.

- \xf0\x9f\x93\xa4 **Outputs**<br>
  Exposes the old and new version numbers, and the type of change (major, minor, patch, etc.) as variables that you can use in your workflow.

## Usage

This package can be used three different ways:

- \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96 A [**GitHub Action**](#github-action) as part of your CI/CD process

- \xf0\x9f\xa7\xa9 A [**function**](#javascript-api) that you call in your JavaScript code

- \xf0\x9f\x96\xa5 A [**CLI**](#command-line-interface) that you run in your terminal

## v2 Migration Guide

The v1 to v2 upgrade brought a few notable **breaking changes**. To migrate, make the following updates:

- The `type` output is now an empty string instead of `\'none\'` when no release occurs
  ```diff
    - run: echo ""Version changed!""
  -   if: ${{ steps.publish.outputs.type != \'none\' }}
  +   if: ${{ steps.publish.outputs.type }}
  ```
- The `--ignore-scripts` option is now passed to `npm publish` as a security precaution. If you define any publish lifecycle scripts - `prepublishOnly`, `prepack`, `prepare`, `postpack`, `publish`, `postpublish` - run them explicitly or set the `ignore-scripts` input to `false`.
  ```diff
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  +   ignore-scripts: false
  ```
- The workflow\'s `.npmrc` file is no longer modified. If you have any workarounds to adjust for this misbehavior - for example, if you\'re using `actions/setup-node` to configure `.npmrc` - you should remove them.

  ```diff
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: \'18\'
        registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/

    - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

    - name: Do some more stuff with npm
      run: npm whoami
      env:
  -     INPUT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  +     NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  ```

- The `check-version` and `greater-version-only` options have been removed and replaced with `strategy`.
  - Use `strategy: all` (default) to publish all versions that do not yet exist in the registry.
    ```diff
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    -   check-version: true
    -   greater-version-only: false
    +   strategy: all
    ```
  - Use `strategy: upgrade` to only publish versions that upgrade the selected tag.
    ```diff
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    -   check-version: true
    -   greater-version-only: true
    +   strategy: upgrade
    ```
  - `check-version: false` has been removed. You may not need this action if you\'re not checking already published versions; [you can `npm` directly][publishing-nodejs-packages], instead.
    ```diff
    - - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v1
    -   with:
    -     token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    -     check-version: false
    + - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    +   with:
    +     node-version: \'18\'
    +     registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
    + - run: npm publish
    +   env:
    +     NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
    ```

## GitHub Action

To use the GitHub Action, you\'ll need to add it as a step in your [workflow file][]. By default, the only thing you need to do is set the `token` parameter to your [npm authentication token][].

```yaml
```

You can also publish to third-party registries. For example, to publish to the [GitHub Package Registry][], set `token` to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` and `registry` to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`:

```yaml
```

[workflow file]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions
[npm authentication token]: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens
[GitHub Package Registry]: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry

### Output

npm-publish exposes some output variables, which you can use in later steps of your workflow. To access the output variables, you\'ll need to set an `id` for the npm-publish step.

```yaml
```

## JavaScript API

To use npm-package in your JavaScript code, you\'ll need to install it using [npm][] or other package manager of choice:

```bash
```

You can then import it and use it in your code like this:

```javascript
```

[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/

### Usage

As shown in the example above, you should pass an options object to the `npmPublish` function. In TypeScript, the `Options` interface is available as an import.

```ts
```

  ### Outputs
  None.

  ## Example
  ```yml
name: ""test""
on: # run on any PRs and main branch changes
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

662,"# Setup cmake for GitHub Actions

Github action to setup the cmake build script generator.

This action will update the path for your workflow to include cmake
matching the platform and version requirements.

### Usage

Adding a step that uses this action to your workflow will setup cmake
and make it available to subsequent steps:

```yaml
```

### Options

There are three options for the action:

* `cmake-version` controls the version of CMake that is added to the path. This
  can be a fully specified verison `3.3.0`, partly specified `3.2`, a wildcard
  version `3.2.x`. By default it is empty which will give the latest CMake
  version available on GitHub.

  The version can also be specified to be `latest` which is equivalent to
  leaving it blank and will give the latest version.

  The [version tests] show some expected values for given versions.

* `github-api-token` is optional, but is used to authenticate with GitHub's
  API. By default it will use the token generated by the workflow. If set to
  blank then no authentication is used to access the API and there is a chance
  that the test runner will have hit the API rate limit causing the action to
  fail to download the available versions from GitHub.

  See also:
   - [GitHub API rate limiting]
   - [GITHUB_TOKEN]

* `use-32bit` forces the use of a 32 bit binary, instead of first looking for a
  64 bit binary. Note that more recent releases of cmake only have 32 bit
  packages for windows and not for linux or macos, so this option may cause
  failures in those cases.

  Possible values are `true` or `false`. The default is `false`.

### How it works

The action will download the list of releases of CMake available on GitHub and
choose the best match for the test runner's platform and the version
requirements given as as option. The CMake package is then either downloaded
from GitHub, or a cached version from the action's tool cache is used, and the
executables are provided on the path for subsequent workflow steps.

665,"# Close issues that don\'t follow the issue template

## How it works

This GitHub action will fetch all the files inside of `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, parse the titles and compare those titles with the content of the opened/edited issue, if they don\'t match, it will:

1. Add a label to the issue (configurable with the input property `closed-issues-label`);
   > This step won\'t run if no label is provided.
1. Add a message to the issue;
1. Close it.

If the user happens to edit the issue to match the template, the action will run again and, if it matches, it will remove the label and reopen the issue automatically.

> This will only work if you have the input property `closed-issues-label` provided.

## Installation

Put the following content in the file `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

```yml
```

## Configuration

You can configure `issue-close-message` and `closed-issues-label`, which are, respectively, the message that is shown when closing the issue and the label added to the issue when it being closed.

For `issue-close-message` the example configuration uses `issue.user.login` to mention the user\'s username, you can check what you can specify on the message on [GitHub webhook documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-15).

666,"# Auto Assign Action

An action which adds reviewers to the pull request when the pull request is opened.

## :arrow_forward: Usage

Create a workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/action.yml` For more detail, refer to [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) for running the auto-assign action.

```yml
```

Change event that triggers a workflow to the `pull_request_target` if you want to enable the auto-assign action when opening pull requests from fork repositories or bots like Dependabot.

Using dangerous misuse of the `pull_request_target` event can be a security risk, so make sure you understand pros and cons before using it. 

See below for details:

- [Events that trigger workflows / Pull request target - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)
- [Events that trigger workflows / Pull request events for forked repositories - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories)

```diff
```

Create a separate configuration file for the auto-assign action (e.g. `.github/auto_assign.yml`).

### Single Reviewers List

Add reviewers/assignees to the pull request based on single reviewers list.

```yaml
```

### Multiple Reviewers List

Add reviewers/assignees to the pull request based on multiple reviewers list.

If you and peers work at the separate office or they work at the separate team by roles like frontend and backend, you might be good to use adding reviewers from each group.

```yaml
```

### Assign Author as Assignee

Add the PR creator as the assignee of the pull request.

```yaml
```

### Filter by label

The action will only run if the PR meets the specified filters

```yaml
```

### Filter draft PRs

The action will only run for non-draft PRs. If you want to run for all PRs, you need to enable it to run on drafts.

```yaml
```

# Badge action

This action generates a SVG badge using GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflow CPU time (no 3rd parties servers). The badge is generated using the NPM package [gradient-badge](https://github.com/bokub/gradient-badge) and [Github Badge Action](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-badge-action) to read and write the GitHub Actions inputs and outputs.

## Inputs

### `label`

**Required** The left label of the badge, usually static.

### `label-color`

**Required** Hex or named color for the label. Default: `555`

### `status`

**Required** The right status as the badge, usually based on results.

### `color`

**Required** An array (comma separated) with hex or named colors of the badge value background. More than one creates gradient background. Default: `blue`.

### `style`

**Required** Badge style: flat or classic. Default: `classic`

### `icon`

Use icon.

### `icon-width`

Set this if icon is not square. Default: `13`

### `scale`

Set badge scale. Default: `1`

### `path`

The file path to store the badge image file. Only output to `badge` action output if not defined.

## Outputs

### `badge`

The badge SVG contents.

## Example usage

```
```

### Commit the changes to dedicated branch

Create the dedicated branch `badges` with (extracted from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11487993/2928168)):

```
```

And then, [follow the example](https://github.com/emibcn/badge-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L44).

### Commit the changes to same branch

See a [workflow example](https://github.com/emibcn/badge-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L60).
Or another [more complex example](https://github.com/emibcn/pywisp/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L178).

Note: You will need to pull auto-generated commits with this technique, or your repo will mess up.

# ssh-scp-deploy

## \xe2\x9d\x94 Why should I use this action?

Because this action provide an easy and highly customizable way to upload files via scp and execute a set of command via ssh before or/and after.  
I use this action to deploy my personal projects to remote server, restarting the needed services or to do a simple upload via scp.

671,"# Code Sign Action

This is a GitHub action that allows you to code sign files. It was developed specifically to code sign binaries built using [@lando/pkg-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pkg-action) so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. It also can do basic [mac OS notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).

### Caveats

* Does not currently code sign on Linux
* Does not staple the notarized file
* You may need to set `options: --options runtime --entitlements entitlements.xml` for notarization to work correctly

## Required Inputs

These keys must be set correctly for the action to work.

| Name | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | The file to sign.  | `bin/test` |
| `certificate-data` | A `base64` encoded string of your `p12` or `pfx` cert contents. | `${{ secrets.APPLE_CERT_DATA }}` |
| `certificate-password` | The password to unlock the `certificate-data`. | `${{ secrets.APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD }}` |

## Optional Inputs

These keys are set to sane defaults but can be modified as needed.

| Name | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apple-notary-user` | **(Required)** for `macOS` notarization. Does nothing on `linux` and `win`. The Apple Developer account email to use in notarization. | `null` | `${{ secrets.APPLE_NOTARY_USER }}` |
| `apple-notary-password` | **(Required)** for `macOS` notarization. Does nothing on `linux` and `win`. The Apple Developer account password to use in notarization. | `null` | `${{ secrets.APPLE_NOTARY_PASSWORD }}` |
| `apple-notary-tool` | The `xcrun` tool to use for notarization. Does nothing on `linux` and `win`. | `notarytool` | `altool` |
| `apple-product-id` | **(Required)** for `macOS` notarization. Does nothing on `linux` and `win`. The Apple Developer Product ID to use in notarization. | `null` | `dev.lando.code-sign-action` |
| `apple-team-id` | **(Required)** for `macOS`. Does nothing on `linux` and `win`. The Apple Developer Program Team ID. | `null` | `FY8GAUX287` |
| `options` | Additional options to pass to the signing tool. | `null` | `--options runtime --entitlements entitlements.xml` |

## Outputs

```yaml
```

##  Usage

### Basic Usage

**macOS**

```yaml
```

**macOS with notarization**

```yaml
```

**Windows**

```yaml
```

This automation provides the ability to automate issues and pull requests related to [Github Projects (Beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects).
If the issue or pull request is not attached to a project, it is automatically added to the project and its desired column.
In addition to status automation, this automation also supports custom field management.

Note: GITHUB_TOKEN does not have the necessary scopes to access projects (beta).
You must create a token with ***org:write*** scope and save it as a secret in your repository or organization.
For more information, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## V1 vs V2

In June 2022, [GitHub announced a breaking change to the Projects API](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-23-the-new-github-issues-june-23rd-update/). Therefore, the @v1 tag of this action will stop working on October 1, 2022. You can switch to the @v2 tag at any time (by updating the reference in your workflow file).

## Project board

Since the issues and pull requests from this repository are also managed by this automation, you can take an example from the public project board to see what it looks like.

## Variables

| Variable                 | Required | Description |
| ------------------------ | -------- |------------ |
| `gh_token`               | false    | The GitHub token to use for the automation. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |
| `gh_app_ID`              | false    | The GitHub App ID used for App authentication. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |
| `gh_app_installation_ID` | false    | The Github App installation ID binding the App to the target org. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |
| `gh_app_secret_key`      | false    | The Github App Secret key used to sign App JWT tokens. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |
| `user`                   | false    | The GitHub username that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |
| `organization`           | false    | The GitHub organization that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |
| `project_id`             | true     | The projectboard id. |
| `resource_node_id`       | true     | The id of the resource node. |
| `status_value`           | false    | The status value to set. Must be one of the values defined in your project board **Status field settings**. If left unspecified, new items are added without an explicit status, and existing items are left alone. |
| `operation_mode`         | false    | The operation mode to use. Must be one of `custom_field`, `status`. Defaults to: `status` |
| `custom_field_values`    | false    | Provides the possibility to change custom fields. To be applied the **operation_mode** must be set to `custom_field`. For the json definition refer to [JSON-Definition](#JSON-Definition) |
| `move_related_issues` | false | If set to `true` and the operation mode is set to `status`, the automation will also move related issues to the same column. This is useful if you want to move an issue to the same column as its related pull request. Defaults to: `false` |

## Getting started

The following example assumes that you have a project board with the following columns:

- **Todo**
- **In Progress**
- **Done**

Before we start to automate the project board, we need to decide whether we want to manage the **Status** field using this action or the workflow definition of the project board. Keep in mind that until now there is no way to automatically add issues or pull requests to the project board using the provided workflow functionality by GitHub. The next example assumes that you decided to use this action to manage the **Status** field.

| Current Status | Target Status   | Event name  | GitHub event  | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **any**        | **Todo**        | issues | `github.event.action == \'opened\'`, `github.event.action == \'reopened\'` | Define an automation that moves an issue to the *Todo* column. |
| **any**        | **In Progress** | pull_request    | `github.event.action == \'opened\'`, `github.event.action == \'reopened\'`, `github.event.action == \'review_requested\'` | Define an automation that moves a pull request to the *In Progress* column. |
| **any**        | **Closed**      | issues, pull_request | `github.event.action == \'closed\'` | Define an automation that moves an issue or pull request to the *Done* column. |

The resulting workflow file is defined as follows:

```yaml
```

### Allowing the workflow to run on PR\'s coming from forks

To allow PR from a fork to run the workflow use `pull_request_target` instead of `pull_request` like the example below.

```yaml
```

Without replacing `pull_request` by `pull_request_target` the workflow will fail with `No GH Auth method configured, provide PAT or App ID/Key`.

```
```

> :warning: Warning
>
> For workflows that are triggered by the `pull_request_target` event, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is granted read/write repository permission unless the `permissions` key is specified and the workflow can access secrets, even when it is triggered from a fork. Although the workflow runs in the context of the base of the pull request, you should make sure that you do not check out, build, or run untrusted code from the pull request with this event. Additionally, any caches share the same scope as the base branch. To help prevent cache poisoning, you should not save the cache if there is a possibility that the cache contents were altered.

## GH App Auth

To leverage the App authentication with this action the following steps are needed:

- Create a GitHub App under your user or organisation as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app), note the App ID
- Set the needed GitHub App permissions in order for the newly create App to access and manage Org Project, as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/editing-a-github-apps-permissions). The minimum required permissions are:
  - Repo: Actions: RW
  - Repo: Checks: RO
  - Repo: Contents: RO
  - Repo: Environments: RO
  - Repo: Issues: RW
  - Repo: Metadata: RO
  - Repo: PR: RW
  - Repo: Commit statuses: RO
  - Org: Members: RO
  - Org: Projects: RW
- Create a private key to authenticate the newly created GitHub App as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps), treat the downloaded key as sensitive material, store it in a GitHub secret accessible by this action.
- Install the app in the target organisation, note the installation ID
- Configure this action with
  - `gh_app_secret_key` containing the aforementioned private key
  - `gh_app_ID` containing the app ID, auto-generated by GitHub in the first step
  - `gh_app_installation_ID` containing the installation ID, auto-generated by GitHub in the previous step. Binging the App to the Org

## JSON-Definition

A single json object is defined as follows:

```json
```

The json definition that must be passed to the `custom_field_values` argument looks like:

```json
```

A detailed example can be found inside the [test.sh](test.sh) file. Note that json definition must be enclosed in an array and escaped with double quotes and backslashes.

Example:

```yaml
```

The following example assumes that your project has the following fields defined:

- `Priority`: As *text* field
- `Number`: As *number* field
- `Date`: As *date* field
- `Single Select`: As *single_select* field with options:
  - `Option 1`
  - `Option 2`
  - `Option 3`
- `Iteration`: As *iteration* field with iterations:
  - `Iteration 1`
  - `Iteration 2`
  - `Iteration 3`

Since version 1.3.0 the iteration field also supports the following values:

- @current: the current iteration
- @next: the next iteration

Both of these values are provided by the `project-beta-automations` package. The following json provides an example of how to use these values:

Next iteration:

```yaml
```

Current iteration:

```yaml
```

## Detailed example

Since this repository is also covered by this automation, you can take a look at the definition within the [project-automation.yml](.github/workflows/project_automations.yml) file to check how it is defined here.

## Debugging

Since debugging is key when tracing a bug, we decided to provide a two step debugging process. To enable the different debugging outputs, you can set the following environment variables:

| Variable         | Option | Default behaviour | Description |
| ---------------- | -------| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEBUG_COMMANDS` | `true` | Do nothing        | Enables the stacktrace for command executions.     |
| `DEBUG_LOG`      | `true` | Do nothing        | Prints out the responses produced by the commands. |

Example workflow definition:

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

A simple [Action] sending [Telegram] notifications for workflows set up with [GitHub Actions].

There's an [article on Medium](https://xinthink.com/build-your-own-github-actions-f3454f22f202) described in detail how I build this [Action].

## Usage

Add a step to your [workflow] in order to receive [Telegram] notifications, for example:

```yml
```

> You can find more details in [action.yml]

The [Telegram] message will look like:
  - BOT name

    \xf0\x9f\x94\xb4 [owner/repo]() Check **Failure**

    `refs/heads/master` `5cabc6f` by **author**

    [View details]()

> Where `Check` will be the name of your workflow

## Development

[Yarn] is preferred for everyday tasks, so there's a `yarn.lock` instead of `package-lock.json` on the *master* branch. We will use [yarn run] ([npm scripts]) for handling the *node_modules* stuff, and also compiling [TypeScript] sources.

- Run command `yarn release` before committing to *release* branches
- Run command `yarn dev` before doing development tasks or committing to the *master* branch

## Usage

Inputs and Outputs are as follows:

| Input | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `inputFile` | `.github/workflows/matrix_includes.json` | The file that contains the JSON configuration of the matrix includes elements. Must come after a Checkout. |
| `filter` | \xe2\x9d\x97 none, user must supply value! | The [JMESPath JSON](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) query to apply to the input file. |
| `addInclude` | true | Wrap the output from the JSON query in an `{include: ...}` object. |

| Output | Description |
| - | - |
| `matrix` | The filtered ""strategy.matrix"" statement created from filtering the ""inputFile"". |

### Sample

```yml
```

### Filtering on Branch Name

The following workflow sample uses the `nelonoel/branch-name` Action so that the branch name itself can be used in the filter:

```yml
```

## Tips

### Necessary JSON File

This Action requires a JSON file that contains the information you would normally include in a `strategy.matrix.include` block (example is [included below](#sample-json-file)). By default, the action will look for a file in your `.github/workflows/` folder named `matrix_includes.json`. If you want to name the file differently, or place it in a different folder, set the path via the `inputFile` input.

If you need to define the entire `strategy.matrix` value, you will need to set `addInclude` to `false`. Please note that you must then ensure your **input file** and **JSON query** provide the results your workflow needs.

#### Sample JSON File

The following is the sample file (`matrix_includes.json`) that was used in the workflow above.

```json
```

### JSON File Placement

For a cleaner repository, I recommend placing the `matrix_includes.json` file in your `.github/workflows/` folder. Doing so will also help communicate the purpose of the file. You do not have to follow this advice, of course, as this Action allows the location of the file to be passed via the `inputFile` input.

## Troubleshooting

This Action requires an output to be passed between jobs. For this Action to run properly, make sure you have defined the output of the `matrix_prep` job appropriately (or whatever you have named it), and that the other jobs have their `needs` block configured to point to the `matrix_prep` job (if they need to use the custom matrix).

## Use Case 

If you have two workflows where the only difference is the matrix elements, you may want to consider using a single workflow file with *conditional* matrix elements (which this Action makes easier):

*Build for main branch*
![Build for main branch](https://i.stack.imgur.com/O95fj.png)
*Build for v2.1-Release branch*

# Get GitHub release information 

Allows you to get a release information by release id, tag, commit SHA or get the last release.

If release not found, it finishes with an error.

## Inputs

### Search by:

Set **exactly 1 input** from the list to search release by:

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `releaseId` 
Release id (number).

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `tag` 
Tag name.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `commitSha`
SHA of commit. Can be used to find a draft release.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `releaseName`
Exact release name. Returns most recent found. Can be used to find a draft release.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `releaseNameRegEx` 
Regexp to test release name

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb8 `latest` 
Set `1` or `true` to get the latest non-draft release.

_If no inputs specified, the action will try to get release for the current commit SHA._

### Additional filters

With any of inputs above you can also use 2 additional filter inputs:

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb9 `draft`
Set `true` to search only for draft releases. <br>
Set `false` to search only releases that are not draft.
Leave empty to not check if a release is a draft.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xb9 `prerelease`
Set `true` to search only for prerelease releases.<br>
Set `false` to search only releases that are not prerelease.
Leave empty to not check if a release is a prerelease.

### Options

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xbb `doNotFailIfNotFound` _Optional, default: `false`_

Set `true` to force the action to finish with success even if release was not found. 
Can be useful in composite actions, where `continue-on-error` is not available.
If set, you can examine `id` output to know if release was found.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xbb `searchLimit` _Optional, default: `90`_
If you use one of `commitSha`, `releaseName`, 
`releaseNameRegEx` inputs you can also specify how many releases action should retrieve to perform 
a search. Specify more than 90 if
you age going to search for old releases and less if you want to speed up the search.

#### \xf0\x9f\x94\xbb `repo` _Optional, default: current repository_

Repository name in form of ""owner/name"". If not set, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env variable is used that by 
default points to a current repository.

## Env variables

You should set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable to enable action to access GitHub API. See example.

## Outputs
Values from [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#releases) response object:

* `html_url`
* `upload_url` can be used to upload assets
* `tarball_url`
* `zipball_url`
* `id`
* `tag_name`
* `target_commitish`
* `name`
* `body`
* `draft` contains `true` or `false` string value
* `prerelease` contains `true` or `false` string value
* `created_at`
* `published_at`
* `url`
* `assets_url`
* `node_id`
* `author` (JSON with author object)
* `assets` (JSON with assets object)

The jacoco-badge-generator can be used in one of two ways: as a GitHub Action or as a command-line 
utility (e.g., such as part of a local build script). The jacoco-badge-generator parses a `jacoco.csv` 
from a JaCoCo coverage report, computes coverage percentages 
from [JaCoCo\'s Instructions and Branches counters](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html), and 
generates badges for one or both of these (user configurable) to provide an easy 
to read visual summary of the code coverage of your test cases. The default behavior directly
generates the badges internally with no external calls, but the action also provides an option
to instead generate [Shields JSON endpoints](#direct-badge-generation-vs-json-endpoint). It supports
both the basic case of a single `jacoco.csv`, as well as multi-module projects in which
case the action can produce coverage badges from the combination of the JaCoCo reports
from all modules, provided that the individual reports are independent. It can also be configured to 
generate a simple JSON file containing the coverages as double-precision floating-point values, either 
instead of or in addition to generating the badges, which may be useful as input to other tools.

When used as a GitHub Action, the jacoco-badge-generator can also optionally be used as part of a pull-request 
check. Specifically, you can configure it to fail the workflow run if coverage decreased relative to prior run, 
and/or if coverage is below a target threshold. See the [Inputs](#inputs) section for details of how to configure 
it for this purpose. 

_The developers of the jacoco-badge-generator are not affiliated with the developers of JaCoCo, although we are a 
fan and user of their excellent test coverage tool._

## The Coverage Metrics

The jacoco-badge-generator currently supports generating badges for 
the two primary coverage metrics generated by JaCoCo: Instructions (C0 Coverage), and 
Branches (C1 Coverage). Here is a summary of what these compute and why they were chosen
for inclusion by this badge generator.

### Instructions Coverage (C0 Coverage)

The default behavior of the badge generator is to generate only the Instructions Coverage
badge, which is labeled on the badge simply as ""coverage"". JaCoCo 
measures [C0 Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)
from the Java bytecode instructions in the compiled `.class` files. One of the advantages
to counting the bytecode instructions executed or missed, rather than lines of source code, 
is that it is independent of coding style and formatting. As a simple example, consider
the sequence of Java statements to swap the values in two 
variables: `int temp = a; a = b; b = temp;`.  A line counter will count this as 1 line if
written on a single line, or 3 lines if each statement is written on its own line. However,
JaCoCo\'s instructions counter treats these two cases as equivalent since they compile
to the same bytecode. Consider a more complex example of calling a method while passing a simple
value, such as `foo(5)` versus passing the result of a calculation to the method, such as
`foo(2.0 + bar/11.0)`. Line counting considers both of these as 1 line; while the second case
will factor in more heavily into JaCoCo\'s instruction counting than will the first case. For
these reasons, although JaCoCo also provides line coverage data, we do not currently support
generating a badge from JaCoCo\'s line counter data. JaCoCo\'s use of bytecode instructions
in its definition of C0 Coverage is a more meaningful measure of coverage than is counting
lines of code.

### Branches Coverage (C1 Coverage)

The badge generator also optionally supports generating a badge for Branches Coverage
(or C1 Coverage), with the generated badge labeled as ""branches"".  See 
the [inputs](#inputs) section for a description of the action
inputs.  JaCoCo 
measures [C1 Coverage or Branches Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)
from the Java bytecode in the compiled `.class` files, so the result may be a bit
different than what you might expect from branch coverage. At first, you may even mistakenly
guess that it is counting conditions (C2 coverage) rather than branches, but it is counting
branches (in bytecode rather than in source code). Consider this example to illustrate
the difference: `if (a && b) foo(); else bar();`. If we count branches in source code,
there are 2 branches, which would require a minimum of two tests for full coverage, one where
both `a` and `b` are `true`, and a second test where at least one of them is `false`.
If we instead count conditions, there are 4 conditions (`a==true`, `a==false`, `b==true`, 
`b==false`), which can be covered with as few as two tests (e.g., `a==true` and `b==false`
as test one, and `b==true` and `a==false` as test two), without actually covering both
branches. JaCoCo\'s branches counter is neither of these. JaCoCo\'s branches counter
counts branches in the Java bytecode. What does that mean for this example? Imagine instead
that the if statement above was written as a pair of nested if 
statements: `if (a) { if (b) { foo(); } else { bar(); } } else { bar(); }`. There are
a total of 4 branches in this case (and is essentially what JaCoCo would count as branches).
To cover all 4 branches would require a minimum of 3 test cases: one where `a` and `b` are both
`true`, one in which `a` is `true` and `b` is `false`, and a third where `a` is `false` and `b`\'s 
value doesn\'t matter. In this way, JaCoCo\'s branches counter leads to a stronger form
of C1 Coverage than is usually implied by branches coverage.


## Badge Style and Content

### Default Color Scheme

Here are a few samples of what the badges look like if you use
the default colors:

| Coverage range | Direct badge generation | Badge generation from endpoint |
| :---  | :--- | :--- | 
| Bright green for 100% coverage  | ![Coverage 100%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/100.svg) | ![Coverage 100%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/100.json) |
| Green for 90% through 99.9% coverage | ![Coverage 99.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999.svg) | ![Coverage 99.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999.json) |
| Yellow green for 80% through 89.9% coverage | ![Coverage 80%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/80.svg) | ![Coverage 80%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/80.json) |
| Yellow for 70% through 79.9% coverage | ![Coverage 70%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/70.svg) | ![Coverage 70%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/70.json) |
| Orange for 60% through 69.9% coverage | ![Coverage 60%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/60.svg) | ![Coverage 60%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/60.json) |
| Red for 0% through 59.9% coverage | ![Coverage 59.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/599.svg) | ![Coverage 59.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/599.json) |
| Sample of a branch coverage badge | ![Branches Coverage 99.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999b.svg) | ![Branches Coverage 99.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999b.json) |

### Customizing Colors or Coverage Intervals

The jacoco-badge-generator provides two inputs that can be used to customize 
the colors used for the badges. The `colors` input enables you to pass a list 
of colors to the action. The `intervals` input enables you to pass a list of 
percentages used to determine color choice. If you like the default colors, 
but want to start the colors at different percentages, then you can use the 
`intervals` input to accomplish that. These two inputs can be used either
individually or in combination depending upon what you want to do. See the
[Inputs](#inputs) section for more details.

### Displayed Percentages

The coverage displayed in the badge is the result of truncating to one 
decimal place.  If that decimal place is 0, then it is displayed as an 
integer.  The rationale for truncating to one decimal place, rather than 
rounding is to avoid displaying a just failing coverage as passing. For
example, if the user of the action considers 80% to be a passing level,
then we wish to avoid the case of 79.9999% being rounded to 80% (it will
instead be truncated to 79.9%). 

### Direct Badge Generation vs JSON Endpoint

The default behavior generates badges that are inspired by the style of the badges 
of [Shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields), and generates the badges entirely
within the jacoco-badge-generator, with no external calls. However, it also supports 
an optional alternative to instead generate [Shields JSON endpoints](https://shields.io/endpoint). 
Most users will likely prefer the default behavior, for a variety of reasons, such as 
simpler insertion of badge into README and probable faster loading. The main reason to 
consider generating a JSON endpoint instead is if you are trying to match the style of 
the coverage badges to other badges in your README that use one of Shields\'s alternative 
styles. The default internally generated badges match the default Shields style. See 
the [Inputs](#inputs) section for more details on how to generate JSON endpoints instead 
of badges.

### Adding the Badges to your README

#### If you generate the badges (default behavior)....

If you use the default badges directory and default badge filenames, then 
you can add the coverage badge to your repository\'s readme with the following 
markdown: 
```markdown
```

And likewise for the branch coverage badge: 
```markdown
```

See the [Inputs](#inputs) section for how to change the directory and filenames of
the badges. You can of course also link these to the JaCoCo coverage report if you host it
online, or perhaps to the workflow that generated it, such as with (just replace 
USERNAME and REPOSITORY with yours):
```markdown
```
The above assumes that the relevant workflow is `build.yml` (replace as needed). This will
link the badge to the runs of that specific workflow.

#### If you generate JSON endpoints instead....

Inserting coverage badges into your README is more complex if you use
the alternate behavior of generating JSON endpoints. It involves
passing the URL of your coverage endpoint to Shields custom badge endpoint.
Assuming that you use the default badge directory, you would then use
the following markdown:
```markdown
```
In the above, replace USERNAME, REPOSITORY, and BRANCHNAME with yours. You can do
something similar for the branches coverage badge, such as:
```markdown
```
And of course, you can also link these to your workflow runs just as before with:
```markdown
```

If you do have reason to prefer generating endpoints over generating the badges directly,
then you might consider pushing the endpoints to a GitHub Pages site instead, such
as a project site served from a docs directory of your default branch, or from a gh-pages
branch. To do so, in addition to configuring GitHub Pages, you would need to use the
`badges-directory` input to change the directory where the endpoints are stored
(e.g., in ""docs"" or in a subdirectory of ""docs""). Doing so would probably speed up Shields\'s
access to your JSON endpoint, since you\'d gain the benefit of the CDN that backs GitHub
Pages; whereas passing Shields the URL to the JSON file on GitHub\'s raw server will probably
be slower. Note that the potential benefit is probably small, so if doing so would complicate
your workflow, you can simply pass the URL of the endpoint from GitHub\'s raw server
(e.g., the examples of generating badges from an endpoint in the rightmost column
of the table in section [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme) were done that way,
without the use of GitHub Pages).

This is not an issue if you use the default behavior of directly generating the badge,
since in that case the image is served directly to the viewer from the repository whose 
README is being viewed.


## GitHub Action Usage

The jacoco-badge-generator\'s primary use-case is as a GitHub Action. The subsections of this
section documents how to use it as a GitHub Action.

### Inputs

All inputs include default values, and are thus optional provided the
defaults are relevant to your use-case.

#### `jacoco-csv-file`

This input is the full path, relative to the root of the repository, to 
the `jacoco.csv` file, including filename.  It defaults 
to `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`, which is the default location and filename
assuming you are using the JaCoCo Maven plugin and don\'t change the default
output location. Note that if you are using Gradle to run your build, you will
definitely need to use this input, because the default location and name of the
jacoco csv report is different than it is in Maven. If you use Gradle\'s default
output directories, then you will need to set this input with something 
like: `jacoco-csv-file: build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.csv`.

If you have a multi-module project, you can pass the paths (including filenames)
to all of the `jacoco.csv` files for all of the sub-projects. Separate these by spaces,
and in particular see the [Multi-Module Example Workflows](#multi-module-example-workflows)
for an example of how to do this. Multi-module support is limited to cases where
each module has its own test coverage report, and where those reports don\'t overlap.

You can also use a glob pattern to specify the set of JaCoCo reports for your modules.
For example, `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/jacoco.csv""` will match all `jacoco.csv` files found
across all directories within your project. Or for example `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/*.csv""`
will match all `csv` files found within your project, but be careful with such a pattern
if your project has other `csv` files that are not JaCoCo reports. Or as another example,
maybe all of your JaCoCo reports are in the same directory, but with names with numbers.
The pattern `jacoco-csv-file: ""target/site/jacoco/module*.csv""` will match all `csv` files
in the directory `target/site/jacoco/` whose name begins with `module`. Note that in all of 
these examples you need the quotes around the glob pattern or else GitHub Actions will 
give you an error that your workflow file is invalid.

The action assumes that all reports passed via this input are 
independent of each other. If you are using matrix testing, such that 
each group of tests produces a report, and where the groups overlap in what
they are testing (e.g., one group tests a portion of a class or method, 
and another group tests another portion, etc), then the coverage computed by 
this action will not be correct. The csv reports don\'t contain enough information
to properly merge such overlapping reports. If this applies to your use-case, then
you will need to have JaCoCo produce a single JaCoCo report first (for example, 
see [jacoco:report-aggregate](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/report-aggregate-mojo.html)). 

#### `badges-directory`

This input is the directory for storing badges, relative to the root of the 
repository. The default is `.github/badges`. The action will create the badges
directory if it doesn\'t already exist, although the action itself does not commit.

#### `generate-coverage-badge`

This input controls whether or not to generate the coverage badge (Instructions 
Coverage), and defaults to `true`.

#### `coverage-badge-filename`

This input is the filename for the coverage badge (Instructions or C0 
Coverage). The default filename 
is `jacoco.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn\'t commit the badge file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

#### `generate-branches-badge`

This input controls whether or not to generate the branches coverage badge, and defaults
to `false`. This defaults to `false` to avoid surprising users who upgrade from earlier
versions with a badge they didn\'t know would be generated.

#### `branches-badge-filename`

This input is the filename for the branches coverage badge (C1 
Coverage). The default filename 
is `branches.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn\'t commit the badge file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

#### `generate-coverage-endpoint`

This input controls whether or not to generate a JSON endpoint 
for coverage (Instructions Coverage), and defaults to `false`.

#### `coverage-endpoint-filename`

This input is the filename for the coverage endpoint (Instructions or C0 
Coverage) if you have opted to generate a JSON endpoint instead of the
badge. The default filename is `jacoco.json`, and will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

#### `generate-branches-endpoint`

This input controls whether or not to generate a JSON endpoint 
for branches coverage, and defaults to `false`.

#### `branches-endpoint-filename`

This input is the filename for the branches coverage endpoint (C1 
Coverage) if you have opted to generate a JSON endpoint instead of the
badge. The default filename is `branches.json`, and will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

#### `generate-summary`

This input controls whether or not to generate a simple JSON
summary report of the following form:

```JSON
```

The default is `generate-summary: false`. To enable, use
`generate-summary: true`.

#### `summary-filename`

This input is the filename for the summary report (see above). The
default is `summary-filename: coverage-summary.json`, and will be
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

#### `coverage-label`

This input is the text for the label on the left side of the coverage badge, which
defaults to `coverage`.

#### `branches-label`

This input is the text for the label on the left side of the branches coverage badge, which
defaults to `branches`.

#### `colors`

This input can be used to change the colors used for the badges.
It defaults to `colors: \'#4c1 #97ca00 #a4a61d #dfb317 #fe7d37 #e05d44\'`,
which are the hex color codes for the colors described previously in 
section [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme).
Because `#` has special meaning to YAML (it is used for comments), you 
must either put quotes around the input value as shown in this example, or
you can escape each `#`. The list of colors that you pass here can either
be space separated (as shown) or comma separated. The colors in this list
can be specified either with hex (as in the example above), or with any
named colors that are recognized by SVG, or some combination of the two.
Here is an example with named 
colors: `colors: green yellow orange red purple blue`. Notice that you don\'t need
quotes around the input if none of the colors are specified by hex.
Although the default uses six colors and six coverage intervals, you can have
as many or as few as you want. For example, if you want to use `green` regardless
of percentage, you can set colors like this: `colors: green`. If you pass more
colors than there are intervals, then the extra colors will be ignored. If you 
pass an empty list of colors, then the action will simply use the default colors.
__The action does not do any validation of the colors that you pass.__

#### `intervals`

This input enables specifying the coverage intervals for the 
different colors. It is a simple list of percentages. The default
is `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`, which corresponds to what is
described in the section [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme)
earlier.  The action assumes that the percentages in this list are in 
decreasing order. You can space separate or
comma separate the percentages. For example, `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`
is equivalent to `intervals: 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 0`. A mix of spaces and commas
will also work.

If you specify too many intervals, the extras will simply be ignored. If there
are C colors altogether, then only the first (C-1) percentages specified in 
this input are used, with the last color designated for coverages that are below 
that last cutoff.  For example, if you use the default set of 6 colors, then
`intervals: 100 90 80 70 60` is equivalent to `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`.

Although these examples have integer percentages, the action 
supports floating-point values. For example, you can specify something 
like `intervals: 99.5 90 80 70 60`.

If you only want to use the first three default colors (bright green, green, 
and yellow green), then you don\'t necessarily need to change the value
of the `colors` input. You can keep the default colors, and
then you can use something like `intervals: 80 60`, which will assign
80 and above to bright green, 60 and above to green, and less than 60 to yellow
green.

If you like some of the default colors, but want to skip over some of them,
then you can either use a combination of the `colors` input and `intervals`
input to accomplish this, or you can leave `colors` at the default and
exploit the action\'s assumption of decreasing percentages in the `intervals`
input to skip the ones you don\'t like. For example, if 
you want to use bright green for 80 and above, 
yellow for 60 and above, and red for less than 60, you might do something like the
following: `intervals: 80 80 80 60 60 0`. The 0 at the end is optional.  

#### `on-missing-report`

This input controls what happens if one or more `jacoco.csv` files do not exist.
This input accepts one of three possible values: `fail`, `quiet`, or `badges`.
The behavior of these is defined as follows:
* The default is `on-missing-report: fail`, in which case the action will 
  return a non-zero exit code (causing the workflow run to fail) if one 
  or more files listed in the `jacoco-csv-file` input do not exist, or if
  an empty list of files is passed to the action. We recommend that you use
  this default since missing coverage report files in most cases probably means
  that there is either a bug in your workflow (e.g., typo in path to jacoco.csv)
  or that something went wrong in an earlier step (e.g., unit tests failed, halting
  generation of the coverage report).
* You can use `on-missing-report: quiet` if you would rather the workflow
  itself not fail, in which case the action will instead quietly exit 
  without producing badges if any JaCoCo reports are missing.
* Although not recommended, a third option, `on-missing-report: badges`, will
  cause the action to produce badges from the report files that do exist, simply
  ignoring missing report files, provided that at least one such report file 
  exists. We do not recommend this option since such a case is likely due to an 
  error in your workflow, and any badges produced are likely computed with missing data.

Regardless of value passed to this input, the action will log warnings for
any files listed in the `jacoco-csv-file` input that do not exist, for your 
inspection in the workflow run. 

#### `fail-if-coverage-less-than`

This input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if
the computed coverage is less than a minimum. The default is 0, effectively
disabling the option. You can specify it as either a floating point value
in the interval 0.0 to 1.0, or as a percent (with or without the percent sign).
For example, all of the following are equivalent: `fail-if-coverage-less-than: 0.6`,
`fail-if-coverage-less-than: 60`, or `fail-if-coverage-less-than: ""60%""`.
Note that in the last case, you need the quotes due to the percent sign.
Values greater than 1 are assumed percents.

#### `fail-if-branches-less-than`

This input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if
the computed branches coverage is less than a minimum. The default is 0, effectively
disabling the option. You can specify it as either a floating point value
in the interval 0.0 to 1.0, or as a percent (with or without the percent sign).
For example, all of the following are equivalent: `fail-if-branches-less-than: 0.6`,
`fail-if-branches-less-than: 60`, or `fail-if-branches-less-than: ""60%""`.
Note that in the last case, you need the quotes due to the percent sign.
Values greater than 1 are assumed percents.

#### `fail-on-coverage-decrease`

This input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if
the computed coverage is less than it was on the previous run as recorded in either the
existing coverage badge, the existing coverage Shields endpoint, or the JSON summary 
report (see the `generate-summary` input), if one of these exists. The default 
is `false`.  Use `fail-on-coverage-decrease: true` to enable. 

Additionally, at least one of the `generate-summary`, `generate-coverage-badge`, 
or `generate-coverage-endpoint` inputs must also be `true`, as the action will otherwise assume
that there is no existing badge or summary report from which to get the prior coverage.
If more than one of these exist, this feature will use the summary report to determine if coverage
decreased since it is more precise than the truncated coverage percentage stored in 
the badge or Shields endpoint. __Therefore, when using this feature, it is recommended that
you also set `generate-summary: true` and commit the summary report JSON file to the repository.__

#### `fail-on-branches-decrease`

This input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if
the computed branches coverage is less than it was on the previous run as recorded in either the
existing branches coverage badge, the existing branches coverage Shields endpoint, or the JSON summary 
report (see the `generate-summary` input), if one of these exists. The default is `false`. 
Use `fail-on-branches-decrease: true` to enable. 

Additionally, at least one of the `generate-summary`, `generate-branches-badge`, 
or `generate-branches-endpoint` inputs must also be `true`, as the action will otherwise assume
that there is no existing badge or summary report from which to get the prior coverage.
If more than one of these exist, this feature will use the summary report to determine if branches coverage
decreased since it is more precise than the truncated coverage percentage stored in 
the badge or Shields endpoint. __Therefore, when using this feature, it is recommended that
you also set `generate-summary: true` and commit the summary report JSON file to the repository.__

#### `generate-workflow-summary`

This input controls whether or not to log the coverage percentages to the GitHub Actions
Workflow Job Summary. The default is `generate-workflow-summary: true`. This input is only 
relevant when running in GitHub Actions mode, and not when running as a CLI tool.


### Outputs

The action also outputs the actual computed coverage percentages as double-precision
floating-point numbers. So you can add a step to your workflow to access these if 
desired (these action outputs are values in the interval from 0.0 to 1.0).

#### `coverage`

This output is the actual computed coverage percentage in the interval 
from 0.0 to 1.0.  This is coverage computed from the instructions
coverage data in the JaCoCo csv report.

#### `branches`

This output is the actual computed branches coverage percentage 
in the interval from 0.0 to 1.0.  This is the percentage of branches
covered, computed from the branches data in the JaCoCo csv report.

##### Running JaCoCo via Maven

The example workflows assume that you are using Maven to build and test
a Java project, and that you have the `jacoco-maven-plugin`
configured in your `pom.xml` in the test phase with something
along the lines of the following:

```XML
```

Note that the jacoco-badge-generator action has been tested with
the `jacoco.csv` files generated by `jacoco-maven-plugin` versions
0.8.6 through 0.8.10, and has not been tested with earlier versions
of JaCoCo.

##### Running JaCoCo via Gradle

If you use gradle as your build tool, then you can configure JaCoCo
in `build.gradle.kts` with:

```Kotlin
```

Or the equivalent in `build.gradle`:

```Gradle
```

#### Basic Action Syntax

If you use Maven as your build tool, then you will have steps
in your workflow along the lines of the following (which assumes
that Maven is configured to run JaCoCo during the test phase:

```yml
```

The equivalent for Gradle is:

```yml
```

You can also use a specific release with:

```yml
```

#### All Possible Action Inputs

This shows a workflow step that uses all of the
possible inputs of the `jacoco-badge-generator` action.
It simply shows all of the inputs with their default values.
See the [Inputs](#inputs) section for complete details of
what these inputs do.

```yml
```

Since the above shows all of the default values of the action inputs, 
it is equivalent to:

```yml
```

#### Example Workflow 1: Generate instructions (or C0) coverage badge only.

This sample workflow runs on pushes to the main
branch.  It first sets up Java, and runs the tests with Maven. If you
have JaCoCo configured to run during the test phase, this will also
produce the JaCoCo reports.  The jacoco-badge-generator action is then
run to parse the `jacoco.csv`, compute the coverage percentage, and
generate the badge.  The coverage percentage is then logged in the
workflow so you can inspect later if necessary. The next step of the workflow
checks if any changes were made to the badge, and if so, does a commit and a push (note
that there are also GitHub Actions that you can use for that step). And 
finally, the JaCoCo coverage reports are uploaded as a workflow
artifact using the [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
GitHub Action, so you can inspect them if necessary.

```yml
```

#### Example Workflow 2: Generate instructions coverage and branches coverage badges.

This example workflow is just like the above example, however, it generates
both badges (instructions coverage percentage and branches coverage percentage).
This example also uses 
the [EndBug/add-and-commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit) action to 
commit and push the badge, whereas the previous example did this step with 
shell commands.

```yml
```

### Multi-Module Example Workflows

#### Example Workflow 3: Generate Instructions and Coverage Badges for a Multi-Module Project.

This example workflow generates both badges (instructions coverage percentage 
and branches coverage percentage) for a multi-module project. The badges that are generated
are computed over all modules. To do so, simply pass the paths to all of the JaCoCo reports
that you want to include via the `jacoco-csv-file` input. The `>` is just Yaml\'s way of writing
a string across multiple lines. You can also just list all on a single space-separated line,
but your workflow file will be easier for you to read if you put them one per line.
In this example, there are three subprojects: `module1`, `module2`, and `module3`.

```yml
```

#### Example Workflow 4: Glob Pattern to Specify Reports of a Multi-Module Project.

This example workflow uses a glob pattern to specify the reports of a multi-module project,
and generates both badges (instructions coverage percentage and branches coverage percentage). 
The badges that are generated are computed over all modules. In this example, all of the JaCoCo
reports are named `jacoco.csv` but reside in different directories. You can match all of them
with `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/jacoco.csv""`. The quotes around the glob are required to avoid an
invalid workflow error from GitHub Actions.

```yml
```

#### Example Workflow 5: Multi-Module Project with Separate Badges for Each Module.

If you would prefer to generate separate coverage badges for each of the
modules of a multi-module project, then just include multiple steps of the
`jacoco-badge-generator` in your workflow, such as in this example. Be sure to use
the inputs to specify names for the badge files, otherwise with the defaults
the subsequent steps will overwrite the previous. This example assumes that there
are two modules. You also will likely want to use the `coverage-label` and `branches-label`
inputs to change the text on the left side of the badges if you are displaying badges
for multiple modules in the README of the same repository. This example demonstrates that
as well.

```yml
```

### Examples in Other Projects

#### Template Repository with Runnable Workflow Examples 
We now have
a [template repository](https://github.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator) 
with a simple Maven Java project, using the `jacoco-maven-plugin`,
along with several live, runnable workflows to demonstrate a variety of use-cases
for the `jacoco-badge-generator` action. That repository,
[cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator),
is a template so that you can potentially use it as a project starter. You can of course
fork it instead. Its README
explains the contents of that repository, especially the details of the various 
workflows it contains, and includes examples inserting the badges into its README.

#### Live Real Examples

If you would like to see examples where the action is actively used, here 
are a few repositories that are actively using the `jacoco-badge-generator` action.
The table provides a link to repositories using the action, and direct links to the
relevant workflow as well as the relevant build configuration (e.g., Maven `pom.xml` 
or Gradle `build.gradle.kts`) so you can see how JaCoCo is 
configured. Note that in all of the Maven examples, JaCoCo is configured within a 
Maven profile within the `pom.xml`, which is then activated via a command line 
option when `mvn` is run by the workflow on all push/pull request events. Configuration 
can instead be done in the `<build>` section if you\'d rather not use a profile.

| Repository | Workflow | Build Configuration |

## Command-Line Usage

The jacoco-badge-generator started its life as a GitHub Action, but due to interest can now
be used as a command-line utility outside of GitHub Actions. 

### Installing from PyPI

The jacoco-badge-generator requires Python 3 (and has been tested with 3.8 and above).

To install from PyPi (Unix and MacOS):

```Shell
```

To install from PyPi (Windows):

```Shell
```

To upgrade to the latest version from PyPi (Unix and MacOS):

```Shell
```

To upgrade to the latest version from PyPi (Windows):

```Shell
```

### Running for the First Time

After installing, we recommend running it once with the `-h` or `--help` flag
to see the details of all of the available command-line options.

On Unix or MacOS:

```Shell
```

On Windows:

```Shell
```

### CLI Examples

All GitHub Action inputs have a counterpart command-line option that can be
used in CLI mode. See the [Inputs](#inputs) section earlier for details. If the GitHub 
Actions input is named `input-name`, then in CLI mode, the corresponding command-line 
option is `--input-name`. All options are optional and provide relevant defaults 
for the basic use-case. The defaults are nearly identical to those of the GitHub Action, 
with a few exceptions.

Here are a few examples. Note that all examples assume Unix (e.g., Python command is
`python3`). If on Windows, just change `python3` to `py` in all of the examples below.

#### All Defaults

As an example, from the root of your project (assuming you\'ve already run JaCoCo), execute
the following. In this example, all of the defaults are used, which will generate only the
instructions coverage badge, and will place it in a `badges` directory (creating it if it 
doesn\'t exist). Note that the default directory for the generated badges is one of the differences
between the defaults in CLI mode vs GitHub Actions mode.

```Shell
```

#### Generating Instructions Coverage and Branches Coverage Badges

```Shell
```

#### Generating Shields JSON Endpoints Instead of Badges

If you want to generate Shields JSON endpoints instead of badges, you need
to disable generating the coverage badge, and enable the JSON endpoints:

```Shell
```

#### Changing Colors and Coverage Intervals

If you want to change the colors used and the coverage intervals for each color,
you can use the `--colors` and `--intervals` options. In the following example,
green is used if coverage is at least 90 percent, yellow if coverage is less than 90 but
at least 75 percent, orange is used if coverage is less than 75 percent but at least 60
percent, and red is used if coverage is less than 60 percent.

```Shell
```

Colors can be specified as either SVG named colors as above or as 6-digit or 3-digit hex colors
(see the [Inputs](#inputs) earlier for more detail).

#### Changing the Badges Directory

```Shell
```

#### Gradle Location of JaCoCo Report

The utility by default assumes that the JaCoCo report is the Maven default 
of `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`. If it is somewhere else, there is an option
to specify its location. Here is an example with Gradle\'s standard location
and name of the JaCoCo csv report.

```Shell
```

#### Multi-Module Example

If you have a multi-module project with multiple coverage reports that you want to combine (provided
they are independent), then you can specify the locations and names of all of the report files with
something like:

```Shell
```

In CLI mode, glob patterns will be handled by your shell. You can accomplish the above with:

```Shell
```

Or perhaps all of your reports are named `jacoco.csv` but in different directories, then you can
match all of them with:

```Shell
```

## Summary of Input Defaults

The following table summarizes the default values of all inputs for both the GitHub Actions
usage as well as the CLI usage. If your use-case requires the defaults as specified below, then
you do not need to include them.

| GitHub Actions Default | CLI Default |

## Example

### Simple

```yaml
```

### All Options

```yaml
    github_user: github-user
    workflow_file_name: main.yml
    ref: release-branch
    wait_interval: 10
    client_payload: \'{}\'
    propagate_failure: false
    trigger_workflow: true
    wait_workflow: true
```

### Comment the current running workflow URL for a PR

```yaml
    comment_downstream_url: ${{ github.event.pull_request.comments_url }}
```

## Testing

You can test out the action locally by cloning the repository to your computer. You can run:

```shell
```

You will have to create a Github Personal access token. You can create a test workflow to be executed. In a repository, add a new `main.yml` to `.github/workflows/`. The workflow will be:

```shell
```

You can see the example [here](https://github.com/keithconvictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait-example-repo1/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml). For testing a failure case, just add this line after the sleep:

```yaml
```

## Potential Issues

A NO-FREE-USAGE action for github. (Only worked with github action.)

# TL;DR
Sometimes you don't want some own the permission to file an issue on your repository, especially when you are being volunteered by this person to do a free bang job for him/her.
It's wasting time if you always close them manually. So here we provide an action to detect whether the user starred or forked or both done, then close & lock the issue if they don't.

\r
> Queries the GitHub actions runner's public IP address using [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/)\r
\r
### Motivation\r
GitHub actions shared runners are hosted in **Azure** (Windows & Linux) and **Mac Stadium** for macOS, so whitelisting all these infrastructures can be difficult and needs to be updated every once in a while.\r
\r
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners)\r
\r
This action allows you to whitelist the runner's address and remove it once the pipeline finishes.\r
\r
## Usage\r
\r
### Inputs\r
\r
* `maxRetries` - How many retries on the ipify API before failing. Default: `5`\r
\r
### Outputs\r
\r
* `ipv4` - Public IPv4 of the runner\r
* `ipv6` - Public IPv6 of the runner. If not available the `ipv4` will be returned\r

## Features \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80

*   Fast execution, averaging 0-10 seconds.
*   Leverages either [Github\'s REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-commits) or [Git\'s native diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) to determine changed files.
*   Facilitates easy debugging.
*   Scales to handle large repositories.
*   Supports Git submodules.
*   Supports [merge queues](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) for pull requests.
*   Generates escaped [JSON output for running matrix jobs](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/.github/workflows/matrix-test.yml) based on changed files.
*   Lists changed directories.
    *   Limits matching changed directories to a specified maximum depth.
    *   Optionally excludes the current directory.
*   Writes outputs to a designated `.txt` or `.json` file for further processing.
*   Restores deleted files to their previous location or a newly specified location.
*   Supports Monorepos by fetching a fixed number of commits.
*   Compatible with all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
*   Supports [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).
*   Supports [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.3/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server).
*   Supports [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
*   Lists all files and directories that have changed:
    *   Between the current pull request branch and the last commit on the target branch.
    *   Between the last commit and the current pushed change.
    *   Between the last remote branch commit and the current HEAD.
*   Restricts change detection to a subset of files and directories:
    *   Provides boolean output indicating changes in specific files.
    *   Uses [Glob pattern](https://codepen.io/mrmlnc/pen/OXQjMe) matching.
        *   Supports Globstar.
        *   Supports brace expansion.
        *   Supports negation.
    *   Uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) syntax for specifying patterns.
        *   Supports [YAML anchors & aliases](https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors).
        *   Supports [YAML multi-line strings](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

## Usage \xf0\x9f\x92\xbb

> **Warning**
>
> *   For `push` events: When configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage), make sure to set [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) to either `0` or `2`, depending on your use case.
> *   For mono repositories where pulling all branch history might not be desired, you can still use the default [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage), which is set to `1` for `pull_request` events.
> *   Avoid using single or double quotes for multiline inputs, as the value is already a string separated by a newline character. See [Examples](#examples) for more information.
> *   If [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) isn\'t set to `0`, ensure that `persist-credentials` is set to `true` when configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).
> *   For repositories that have PRs generated from forks, when configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage), set the [`repository`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) to `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}`. See [Example](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L47-L51).

## Known Limitation \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f

> **Warning**
>
> *   Spaces in file names can introduce bugs when using bash loops. See: [#216](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/issues/216)
>     However, this action will handle spaces in file names, with a recommendation of using a separator to prevent any hidden issues.

## Migration guide \xf0\x9f\x94\x84

With the switch from using grep\'s Extended regex to match files to the natively supported workflow glob pattern matching syntax introduced in [v13](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/releases/tag/v13) you\'ll need to modify patterns used to match `files`.

A GitHub action to find an issue or pull request comment.

The action will output the comment ID of the comment matching the search criteria.

## Usage

### Find the first comment containing the specified string

```yml
```

### Find the first comment by the specified author

```yml
```

### Find the first comment containing the specified string AND by the specified author

```yml
          body-includes: search string 1
```

### Find the first comment matching the specified regular expression

```yml
```

### Find the last comment containing the specified string

```yml
          direction: last
```

### Find the nth comment containing the specified string

```yml
          nth: 1 # second matching comment (0-indexed)
```

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The full name of the repository containing the issue or pull request. | `github.repository` (Current repository) |
| `issue-number` | The number of the issue or pull request in which to search. | |
| `comment-author` | The GitHub user name of the comment author. | |
| `body-includes` | A string to search for in the body of comments. | |
| `body-regex` | A regular expression to search for in the body of comments. | |
| `direction` | Search direction, specified as `first` or `last` | `first` |
| `nth` | 0-indexed number, specifying which comment to return if multiple are found | 0 |

#### Outputs

The `comment-id`, `comment-body`, `comment-author` and `comment-created-at` of the matching comment found will be output for use in later steps.
They will be empty strings if no matching comment was found.
Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

Tip: Empty strings evaluate to zero in GitHub Actions expressions.
e.g. If `comment-id` is an empty string `steps.fc.outputs.comment-id == 0` evaluates to `true`.

```yml
      - run: |
          echo ${{ steps.fc.outputs.comment-id }}
          echo ${{ steps.fc.outputs.comment-body }}
          echo ${{ steps.fc.outputs.comment-author }}
          echo ${{ steps.fc.outputs.comment-created-at }}
```

### Accessing issues and pull requests in other repositories

You can search the comments of issues and pull requests in another repository by using a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

A GitHub action that facilitates [""ChatOps""](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/what-is-chatops/) by creating dispatch events for slash commands.

### How does it work?

The action runs in `issue_comment` event workflows and checks the first line of comments for slash commands.
When a valid command is found it creates a [repository dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) event that includes a payload containing full details of the command and its context.
It also supports creating [workflow dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events with defined input parameters.

### Why create dispatch events?

""ChatOps"" with slash commands can work in a basic way by parsing the commands during `issue_comment` events and immediately processing the command.
In repositories with a lot of activity, the workflow queue will get backed up very quickly trying to handle new `issue_comment` events *and* process the commands themselves.

Dispatching commands to be processed elsewhere keeps the workflow queue moving quickly. It essentially enables parallel processing of workflows.

An additional benefit of dispatching is that it allows non-sensitive workloads to be run in public repositories to save using private repository GitHub Action minutes.

## Documentation

- [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)
- [Examples](docs/examples.md)
- [Standard configuration](#standard-configuration)
- [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md)
- [Workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md)
- [Updating to v3](docs/updating.md)

## Dispatching commands

### Standard configuration

The following workflow should be configured in the repository where commands will be dispatched from. This example will respond to comments containing the slash commands `/deploy`, `/integration-test` and `/build-docs`.

```yml
```

Note that not specifying the `repository` input will mean that dispatch events are created in the *current* repository by default. It\'s perfectly fine to use the current repository and not dispatch events to a separate ""processor"" repository.

This action also features [advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) that allows each command to be configured individually if necessary. Use the standard configuration shown above unless you require advanced features.

### Action inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | (**required**) A `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Note: `GITHUB_TOKEN` *does not* work here. See [token](#token) for further details. | |
| `reaction-token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). See [reaction-token](#reaction-token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `reactions` | Add reactions. :eyes: = seen, :rocket: = dispatched | `true` |
| `commands` | (**required**) A comma or newline separated list of commands. | |
| `permission` | The repository permission level required by the user to dispatch commands. See [permission](#permission) for further details. (`none`, `read`, `triage`, `write`, `maintain`, `admin`) | `write` |
| `issue-type` | The issue type required for commands. (`issue`, `pull-request`, `both`) | `both` |
| `allow-edits` | Allow edited comments to trigger command dispatches. | `false` |
| `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch events. | Current repository |
| `event-type-suffix` | The repository dispatch event type suffix for the commands. | `-command` |
| `static-args` | A comma or newline separated list of arguments that will be dispatched with every command. | |
| `dispatch-type` | The dispatch type; `repository` or `workflow`. See [dispatch-type](#dispatch-type) for further details. | `repository` |
| `config` | | JSON configuration for commands. See [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) | |
| `config-from-file` | | JSON configuration from a file for commands. See [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) | |

#### `token`

This action creates [repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) and [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events.
The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have scopes to create these events, so a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required.
If you will be dispatching commands to public repositories *only* then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.

When using the action in a GitHub organization, the user the PAT is created on must be a member of the organization.
Additionally, the PAT should be given the `org:read` scope.

#### `reaction-token`

If you don\'t specify a token for `reaction-token` it will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
Reactions to comments will then be made by the @github-actions bot user.
You can use a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you would prefer reactions to be made by the user account associated with the PAT. 

```yml
```

#### `permission`

This input sets the repository permission level required by the user to dispatch commands.
It expects one of the [five repository permission levels](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization), or `none`.
From the least to greatest permission level they are `none`, `read`, `triage`, `write`, `maintain` and `admin`.

Setting `write` as the required permission level means that any user with `write`, `maintain` or `admin` permission level will be able to execute commands.

Note that `read`, `triage` and `maintain` are only applicable to organization repositories.
For repositories owned by a user account there are only two permission levels, the repository owner (`admin`) and collaborators (`write`).

There is a known issue with permissions when using [nested teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#nested-teams) in a GitHub organization. See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/issues/120) for further details.

#### `dispatch-type`

By default, the action creates [repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) events.
Setting `dispatch-type` to `workflow` will instead create [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events.
There are significant differences in the action\'s behaviour when using `workflow` dispatch. See [workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md) for usage details.

For the majority of use cases, the default `repository` dispatch will likely be the most suitable for new workflows.
If you already have `workflow_dispatch` workflows, you can execute them with slash commands using this action.

| Repository Dispatch (default) | Workflow Dispatch |
| --- | --- |
| Events are created with a `client_payload` giving the target workflow access to a wealth of useful [context properties](#accessing-contexts). | A `client_payload` cannot be sent with [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events. The target workflow can only make use of up to 10 pre-defined inputs, the names of which must match named arguments supplied with the slash command. |
| Slash commands can only execute workflows in the target repository\'s default branch. | Slash commands can execute workflows in any branch using the `ref` named argument. The reference can be a branch, tag, or a commit SHA. This can be useful to test workflows in PR branches before merging. |
| Immediate command validation feedback is unavailable when creating the dispatch event. | Immediate command [validation feedback](docs/workflow-dispatch.md#validation-errors) is available as an action output. |

### How comments are parsed for slash commands

Slash commands must be placed in the first line of the comment to be interpreted as a command.

- The command must start with a `/`
- The slash command extends to the last non-whitespace character on the first line
- Anything after the first line is ignored and can be freely used for comments

![Comment Parsing](docs/assets/comment-parsing.png)

## Handling dispatched commands

The following documentation applies to the `dispatch-type` default, `repository`, which creates [repository_dispatch](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event) events.
For `workflow` dispatch documentation, see [workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md).

### Event types

Repository dispatch events have a `type` to distinguish between events. The `type` set by the action is a combination of the slash command and `event-type-suffix`. The `event-type-suffix` input defaults to `-command`.

For example, if your slash command is `integration-test`, the event type will be `integration-test-command`.

```yml
```

### Accessing contexts

Commands are dispatched with a payload containing a number of contexts.

#### `slash_command` context

The slash command context contains the command and any arguments that were supplied by the user.
It will also contain any static arguments if configured.

To demonstrate, take the following configuration as an example.
```yml
```

For the above example configuration, the slash command `/deploy branch=main dry-run reason=""new feature""` will be converted to a JSON payload as follows.

```json
```

The properties in the `slash_command` context from the above example can be used in a workflow as follows.

```yml
```

#### `github` and `pull_request` contexts

The payload contains the `github` context of the `issue_comment` event at path `github.event.client_payload.github`.
Additionally, if the comment was made in a pull request, the action calls the [GitHub API to fetch the pull request detail](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) and attach it to the payload at path `github.event.client_payload.pull_request`.

You can inspect the payload with the following step.
```yml
```

Note that the `client_payload.github.payload.issue.body` and `client_payload.pull_request.body` context properties will be truncated if they exceed 1000 characters.

### Responding to the comment on command completion

Using [create-or-update-comment](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-comment) action there are a number of ways you can respond to the comment once the command has completed.

The simplest response is to add a :tada: reaction to the comment.

```yml
```

Another option is to reply with a new comment containing a link to the run output.

```yml
```

686,"# Repo Visualizer

A GitHub Action that creates an SVG diagram of your repo. Read more [in the writeup](https://octo.github.com/projects/repo-visualization).

**Please note that this is an experiment. If you have feature requests, please submit a PR or fork and use the code any way you need.**

For a full demo, check out the [githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo) repository.

## Inputs

### `output_file`

A path (relative to the root of your repo) to where you would like the diagram to live.

For example: images/diagram.svg

Default: diagram.svg

### `excluded_paths`

A list of paths to folders to exclude from the diagram, separated by commas.

For example: dist,node_modules

Default: node_modules,bower_components,dist,out,build,eject,.next,.netlify,.yarn,.vscode,package-lock.json,yarn.lock

### `excluded_globs`

A semicolon-delimited array of file [globs](https://globster.xyz/) to exclude from the diagram, using [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) syntax. Provided as an array.

For example:

```yaml
```

### `root_path`

The directory (and its children) that you want to visualize in the diagram, relative to the repository root.

For example: `src/`

Default: `\'\'` (current directory)

### `max_depth`

The maximum number of nested folders to show files within. A higher number will take longer to render.

Default: 9

### `should_push`

Whether to make a new commit with the diagram and push it to the original repository.

Should be a boolean value, i.e. `true` or `false`. See `commit_message` and `branch` for how to customise the commit.

Default: `true`

### `commit_message`

The commit message to use when updating the diagram. Useful for skipping CI. For example: `Updating diagram [skip ci]`

Default: `Repo visualizer: updated diagram`

### `branch`

The branch name to push the diagram to (branch will be created if it does not yet exist).

For example: `diagram`

### `artifact_name`

The name of an [artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) to create containing the diagram.

If unspecified, no artifact will be created.

Default: `\'\'` (no artifact)

### `file_colors`

You can customize the colors for specific file extensions. Key/value pairs will extend the [default colors](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer/pull/src/language-colors.json).

For example: \'{""js"": ""red"",""ts"": ""green""}\'
default: \'{}\'

## Outputs

### `svg`

The contents of the diagram as text. This can be used if you don\'t want to handle new files.

## Example usage

You\'ll need to run the `actions/checkout` Action beforehand, to check out the code.

```yaml
```


## Accessing the diagram

By default, this action will create a new commit with the diagram on the specified branch.

If you want to avoid new commits, you can create an artifact to accompany the workflow run,
by specifying an `artifact_name`. You can then download the diagram using the
[`actions/download-artifact`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact)
action from a later step in your workflow,
or by using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#artifacts).

Example:
```yaml
```
In this example, the diagram will be available at downloads/my-diagram.svg
Note that this will still also create a commit, unless you specify `should_push: false`!

Alternatively, the SVG description of the diagram is available in the `svg` output,
which you can refer to in your workflow as e.g. `${{ steps.make_diagram.outputs.svg }}`.

**Visual config**

Add this to the file `.github/workflows/stats.yml`:

```yml
name: Pull Request Stats

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ADD_A_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          organization: \'piedpiper\'
          period: 7
          charts: true
          disableLinks: true
          sortBy: \'COMMENTS\'
```

This config will:

* Calculate the reviewer stats for all the repos in the ""piedpiper"" organization in the lasts 7 days.
* Display charts for the metrics.
* Remove the links to detailed charts.
* Sort results by the ""comments"" column.

and print a table like this:

|                                                                                                                                                                     | User                 | Total comments      | Total reviews      | Median time to review     |

## Stats

The stats are calculated as follows:

* **Time to review:** The time a reviewer takes from the _Pull Request publication_ or the last _Commit push_ (whatever happens last) to the first time the pull request is reviewed.
* **Time to review:** The **median** of the _times to review_ of all Pull Requests reviewed by a person in the period.
* **Total reviews:** The count of all Pull Requests reviewed by a person in the period.
* **Total comments:** The count of all the comments while reviewing other users\' Pull Requests in the period (comments in own PRs don\'t count).

## Integrations \xf0\x9f\x94\x8c

Check the guide for the tool you want to integrate:

* [Slack](/docs/slack.md)
* [Microsoft Teams](/docs/teams.md)
* [Webhooks](/docs/webhook.md)

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>The action is printing an empty table.</summary>

  1. Make sure the repositories have pull request reviews during the configured `period`.
  2. When specifying `repositories` or `organization` parameters, a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required in the `token` parameter.
  3. If providing a Personal Access Token, ensure it has the `repo` permission for the projects you want.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I get the error ""Error commenting on the pull request..."".</summary>

  This error happens when the organization configures the action\'s permissions as `read`. To fix it, overwrite them by adding a [`permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) configuration in the workflow file. The minimum required permissions are `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`:

  ```yml
  jobs:
    stats:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      permissions:
        contents: read
        pull-requests: write
      steps:
        - name: Run pull request stats
          uses: flowwer-dev/pull-request-stats@master
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I\'m a sponsor but still getting the error ""...is a premium feature, available to sponsors"".</summary>

  1. Check the sponsorship comes from the account that owns the configured repos (usually an organization).
  2. Make sure the sponsorship is configured as `public`, otherwise, the action cannot access the sponsorship information. If you prefer to keep it `private`, please reach me out to make it work for you that way \xf0\x9f\x98\x89.
</details>

## Premium features \xe2\x9c\xa8

This action offers some premium features only for sponsors:

* Disabling telemetry.
* Slack integration.
* Microsoft Teams integration.
* Coming soon: Discord integration, web version.

The **suggested sponsorship is $20 USD / month**. However, if it\'s not possible for you or your organization, please consider supporting it with any amount you can. Even a one-time sponsorship will enable the Premium features and encourage the progress of this project.

Being a sponsor will also give you access to the premium features in all of my [other projects](#related-projects).

Thanks for your support! \xf0\x9f\x92\x99

## Examples

### Working with Issues

This example auto-assigns new issues to two users randomly chosen from `octocat`, `cat` and `dog`.
It won't self-assign to the issue author.

```yml
```

### Working with PRs

This example assigns PRs to a random member of the `support` team:

```yml
```

### Working with Project Cards

> **Warning** > `project_card` events are only supported on legacy Project (Classic) ([see docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#project_card)).

This example assigns a project card to the `triage` team when the card is moved.
It removes previously assigned users.

```yml
```

### Specifying a dynamic user

Instead of hardcoding the user name in the workflow, you can use a repository variable:

-   create a GitHub repo variable named `DEFAULT_ISSUE_ASSIGNEE` with the name of the user
-   use this value `${{ vars.DEFAULT_ISSUE_ASSIGNEE }}` instead of the username in the workflow.
","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
692,"# Rust Cache Action

A GitHub Action that implements smart caching for rust/cargo projects with
sensible defaults.

## Example usage

```yaml
```

Further examples are available in the [.github/workflows](./.github/workflows/) directory.

## Outputs

**`cache-hit`**

This is a boolean flag that will be set to `true` when there was an exact cache hit.

## Cache Effectiveness

This action only caches the _dependencies_ of a crate, so is more effective if
the dependency / own code ratio is higher.

It is also most effective for repositories with a `Cargo.lock` file. Library
repositories with only a `Cargo.toml` file have limited benefits, as cargo will
_always_ use the most up-to-date dependency versions, which may not be cached.

Usage with Stable Rust is most effective, as a cache is tied to the Rust version.
Using it with Nightly Rust is less effective as it will throw away the cache every day,
unless a specific nightly build is being pinned.

## Cache Details

This action currently caches the following files/directories:

- `~/.cargo` (installed binaries, the cargo registry, cache, and git dependencies)
- `./target` (build artifacts of dependencies)

This cache is automatically keyed by:

- the github [`job_id`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_id),
- the rustc release / host / hash,
- the value of some compiler-specific environment variables (eg. RUSTFLAGS, etc), and
- a hash of all `Cargo.lock` / `Cargo.toml` files found anywhere in the repository (if present).
- a hash of all `rust-toolchain` / `rust-toolchain.toml` files in the root of the repository (if present).
- a hash of all `.cargo/config.toml` files in the root of the repository (if present).

An additional input `key` can be provided if the builtin keys are not sufficient.

Before being persisted, the cache is cleaned of:

- Any files in `~/.cargo/bin` that were present before the action ran (for example `rustc`).
- Dependencies that are no longer used.
- Anything that is not a dependency.
- Incremental build artifacts.
- Any build artifacts with an `mtime` older than one week.

In particular, the workspace crates themselves are not cached since doing so is
[generally not effective](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache/issues/37#issuecomment-944697938).
For this reason, this action automatically sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` to disable
incremental compilation, so that the Rust compiler doesn\'t waste time creating
the additional artifacts required for incremental builds.

The `~/.cargo/registry/src` directory is not cached since it is quicker for Cargo
to recreate it from the compressed crate archives in `~/.cargo/registry/cache`.

The action will try to restore from a previous `Cargo.lock` version as well, so
lockfile updates should only re-build changed dependencies.

The action invokes `cargo metadata` to determine the current set of dependencies.

Additionally, the action automatically works around
[cargo#8603](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8603) /
[actions/cache#403](https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/403) which would
otherwise corrupt the cache on macOS builds.

## Cache Limits and Control

This specialized cache action is built on top of the upstream cache action
maintained by GitHub. The same restrictions and limits apply, which are
documented here:
[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)

In particular, caches are currently limited to 10 GB in total and exceeding that
limit will cause eviction of older caches.

Caches from base branches are available to PRs, but not across unrelated
branches.

The caches can be controlled using the [Cache API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache)
which allows listing existing caches and manually removing entries.

## Debugging

The action prints detailed information about which information it considers
for its cache key, and it outputs more debug-only information about which
cleanup steps it performs before persisting the cache.

You can read up on how to [enable debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)
to see those details as well as further details related to caching operations.

## Known issues

- The cache cleaning process currently removes all the files from `~/.cargo/bin`
  that were present before the action ran (for example `rustc`).

## Usage

![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub&color=181717&logo=GitHub&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

Add a GitHub Actions workflow file to your `.github/workflows/` folder similar
to the example shown below.

```yml
```

\xe2\x98\x9d This workflow will mirror the `wiki/` folder in your GitHub repository to the
`user/repo.wiki.git` Git repo that houses the wiki documentation! You can use
any of the [supported markup languages] like MediaWiki, Markdown, or AsciiDoc.

\xf0\x9f\x94\x91 In order to successfully push to the `.wiki.git` Git repository that backs
the wiki tab, we need the `contents: write` permission! Make sure you have
something like shown above either for your entire workflow, or just for one
particular job. This will give the auto-generated `${{ github.token }}` that we
use by default permission to push to the `.wiki.git` repo of the repository that
the action runs on.

<img align=""right"" alt=""Screenshot of \'Create the first page\' button"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/ABKIS4h.png"" />

\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f You must create a dummy page manually! This is what initially creates the
GitHub wiki Git-based storage backend that we then push to in this Action.

After creating your workflow file, now all you need is to put your Markdown
files in a `wiki/` folder (or whatever you set the `path` option to) and commit
them to your default branch to trigger the workflow (or whatever other trigger
you set up).

\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 Each page has an auto-generated title. It is derived from the filename by
replacing every `-` (dash) character with a space. Name your files accordingly.
The `Home.md` file will automatically become the homepage, not `README.md`. This
is specific to GitHub wikis.

### Inputs

- **`strategy`:** Select from `clone` or `init` to determine which method to use
  to push changes to the GitHub wiki. `clone` will clone the `.wiki.git` repo
  and add an additional commit. `init` will create a new repo with a single
  commit and force push to the `.wiki.git`. `init` involves a force-push! The
  default is `clone`.

- **`repository`:** The repository housing the wiki. Use this if you\'re
  publishing to a wiki that\'s not the current repository. You can change the
  GitHub server with the `github-server-url` input. Default is
  `${{ github.repository }}`.

- **`github-server-url`:** An alternate `https://github.com` URL, usually for
  GitHub Enterprise deployments under your own domain. Default is
  `${{ github.server_url }}` (usually `https://github.com`).

- **`token`:** `${{ github.token }}` is the default. This token is used when
  cloning and pushing wiki changes.

- **`path`:** The directory to use for your wiki contents. Default `wiki/`.

- **`commit-message`:** The message to use when committing new content. Default
  is `Update wiki ${{ github.sha }}`. You probably don\'t need to change this,
  since this only applies if you look really closely in your wiki.

- **`ignore`:** A multiline list of files that should be ignored when committing
  and pushing to the remote wiki. Each line is a pattern like `.gitignore`. Make
  sure these paths are relative to the path option! The default is none.

- **`dry-run`:** Whether or not to actually attempt to push changes back to the
  wiki itself. If this is set to `true`, we instead print the remote URL and do
  not push to the remote wiki. The default is `false`. This is useful for
  testing.

- **`preprocess`:** If this option is true, we will preprocess the wiki to move
  the `README.md` to `Home.md` as well as rewriting all `.md` links to be bare
  links. This helps ensure that the Markdown works in source control as well as
  the wiki. The default is true.

#### `strategy:` input

There are some specific usecases where using `strategy: init` might be better
than the default `strategy: clone`.

1. **Your wiki is enormous.** And I don\'t mean in terms of text. Text is nothing
   compared with images. If your wiki has a lot of included images, then you
   probably don\'t want to store the complete history of those large binary
   files. Instead, you can use `strategy: init` to create a single commit each
   time.

2. **You prefer the ""deploy"" semantics.** If you just like the feel of having
   your GitHub wiki act more like GitHub Pages, that\'s great! You can `--force`
   push using `strategy: init` on each wiki deployment and none of that pesky
   history will be saved.

### Outputs

- **`wiki_url`:** The HTTP URL that points to the deployed repository\'s wiki
  tab. This is essentially the concatenation of `${{ github.server_url }}`,
  `${{ github.repository }}`, and the `/wiki` page.

### Cross-repo wikis

You _can_ use this action to deploy your octocat/mega-docs repository to the
octocat/mega-project repository\'s wiki tab! You just need to:

1. Create a custom GitHub Personal Access Token with the permissions to push to
   the octocat/mega-project repository. That\'s the target repo where your wiki
   pages will be pushed to the `.wiki.git`.
2. In the octocat/mega-docs repo (the source code for the wiki), you need to set
   the `repository:` option to `repository: octocat/mega-project` to tell the
   action to push there.
3. You need to set the `token:` option to the Personal Access Token that you
   created with the ability to push to the wiki Git repo. You can use repository
   secrets for this! Something like `token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}` is good!

Here\'s an example of the octocat/mega-docs repo that will push the contents of
the root folder (`./`) to the octocat/mega-project repo\'s wiki tab!

```yml
```

## Development

![Deno](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Deno&color=000000&logo=Deno&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

This GitHub Action uses a self-downloaded version of Deno. See `cliw` for the
`cli.ts` wrapper script that downloads the Deno binary and runs the TypeScript
code. The main script itself is ~100 lines of code, so it\'s not too bad.

\xe2\x84\xb9 Because the version of Deno is _pinned_, it\'s recommended to every-so-often
bump it to the latest version.

To test the action, open a PR! The `test-action.yml` workflow will run the code
with `dry-run: true` as well as a real run! Yes, this does get tedious swapping
between your IDE and the PR, but it\'s the easiest way to test the action.

## Usage

### Docker Hub

To authenticate against [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) it\'s strongly recommended to create a
[personal access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) as an alternative to your password.

```yaml
```

### GitHub Container Registry

To authenticate against the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry),
use the [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow) for the best
security and experience.

```yaml
```

You may need to [manage write and read access of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions#upgrading-a-workflow-that-accesses-ghcrio)
for repositories in the container settings.

You can also use a [personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the [appropriate scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#authenticating-with-the-container-registry).

### GitLab

```yaml
```

If you have [Two-Factor Authentication](https://gitlab.com/help/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication) enabled, use a [Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens) instead of a password.

### Azure Container Registry (ACR)

[Create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#create-a-service-principal)
with access to your container registry through the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
and take note of the generated service principal\'s ID (also called _client ID_) and password (also called _client secret_).

```yaml
```

> Replace `<registry-name>` with the name of your registry.

### Google Container Registry (GCR)

> [Google Artifact Registry](#google-artifact-registry-gar) is the evolution of Google Container Registry. As a
> fully-managed service with support for both container images and non-container artifacts. If you currently use
> Google Container Registry, use the information [on this page](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr)
> to learn about transitioning to Google Artifact Registry. 

You can use either workload identity federation based keyless authentication or service account based authentication.

#### Workload identity federation based authentication

Configure the workload identity federation for github actions in gcloud (for steps, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)). In the steps, your service account should the ability to push to GCR. Then use google-github-actions/auth action for authentication using workload identity like below:

```yaml
```

> Replace `<workload_identity_provider>` with configured workload identity provider. For steps to configure, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation).

> Replace `<service_account>` with configured service account in workload identity provider which has access to push to GCR

#### Service account based authentication

Use a service account with the ability to push to GCR and [configure access control](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control).
Then create and download the JSON key for this service account and save content of `.json` file
[as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
called `GCR_JSON_KEY` in your GitHub repo. Ensure you set the username to `_json_key`,
or `_json_key_base64` if you use a base64-encoded key.

```yaml
```

### Google Artifact Registry (GAR)

You can use either workload identity federation based keyless authentication or  service account based authentication.

#### Workload identity federation based authentication

Configure the workload identity federation for github actions in gcloud (for steps, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)). In the steps, your service account should the ability to push to GAR. Then use google-github-actions/auth action for authentication using workload identity like below:

```yaml
```
> Replace `<workload_identity_provider>` with configured workload identity provider

> Replace `<service_account>` with configured service account in workload identity provider which has access to push to GCR

> Replace `<location>` with the regional or multi-regional [location](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repo-organize#locations)
> of the repository where the image is stored.

#### Service account based authentication

Use a service account with the ability to push to GAR and [configure access control](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control).
Then create and download the JSON key for this service account and save content of `.json` file
[as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
called `GAR_JSON_KEY` in your GitHub repo. Ensure you set the username to `_json_key`,
or `_json_key_base64` if you use a base64-encoded key.

```yaml

> Replace `<location>` with the regional or multi-regional [location](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repo-organize#locations)
> of the repository where the image is stored.

### AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

Use an IAM user with the ability to [push to ECR with `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser` managed policy for example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html#AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser).
Then create and download access keys and save `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` [as secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
in your GitHub repo.

```yaml
```

If you need to log in to Amazon ECR registries associated with other accounts, you can use the `AWS_ACCOUNT_IDS`
environment variable:

```yaml
        env:
          AWS_ACCOUNT_IDS: 012345678910,023456789012
```

> Only available with [AWS CLI version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/get-login.html)

You can also use the [Configure AWS Credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) action in
combination with this action:

```yaml
```

> Replace `<aws-account-number>` and `<region>` with their respective values.

### AWS Public Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

Use an IAM user with the ability to [push to ECR Public with `AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicPowerUser` managed policy for example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-ecr-managed-policies.html#AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicPowerUser).
Then create and download access keys and save `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` [as secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
in your GitHub repo.

```yaml
```

> Replace `<region>` with its respective value (default `us-east-1`).

### OCI Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR)

To push into OCIR in specific tenancy the [username](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/oci/registry/index.html#LogintoOracleCloudInfrastructureRegistryfromtheDockerCLI)
must be placed in format `<tenancy>/<username>` (in case of federated tenancy use the format
`<tenancy-namespace>/oracleidentitycloudservice/<username>`).

For password [create an auth token](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/oci/registry/index.html#GetanAuthToken).
Save username and token [as a secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
in your GitHub repo. 

```yaml
```

> Replace `<region>` with their respective values from [availability regions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/Concepts/registryprerequisites.htm#Availab)

### Quay.io

Use a [Robot account](https://docs.quay.io/glossary/robot-accounts.html) with the ability to push to a public/private Quay.io repository.

```yaml
```

## Customizing

### inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys

| Name             | Type    | Default                     | Description                        |

## Keep up-to-date with GitHub Dependabot

Since [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-github-dependabot)
has [native GitHub Actions support](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#package-ecosystem),
to enable it on your GitHub repo all you need to do is add the `.github/dependabot.yml` file:

```yaml
```

695,"# GitHub Action: Retrieve issues closed by commits
This simple Action provides you a way to retrieve issues that were recently closed via a commit.<br>
The GitHub API currently does not allow us to retrieve that information in any easily accessible way, hence why I made this Action myself.

This Action adheres to the syntax of [Closing issues via keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) provided by GitHub.
It also works with multiple issues being closed in the same commit and it is case-insensitive.<br>
Examples:
* Fixed #123
* Resolves #123
* In this commit we closed #123
* Closed #123 I have
* Closed #123 but also fixed #124

This can be very useful if you want to assign labels to closed tickets for example.<br>
[You can find an example workflow right here](#assign-a-label-to-an-issue-if-it-was-closed-by-a-ticket)

## Inputs

### `token`
**Required** The token is just a standard Access Token from GitHub, this is used for authentication.<br>
You can use the built-in ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} variable for this.

### `max_commits`
**Required** This parameter determines how many commits should be retrieved. The maximal value for this is 100.

## Outputs

### `issues`
The output of this is a JSON Array of numbers, corresponding to the issue numbers that were closed via commits.

## Example usages

### Print out recently closed tickets

```yaml
```

### Assign a label to an issue if it was closed by a ticket
This example will add a ""Resolved"" label to any issue that was closed via a commit.<br>
I am using the GitHub Action [maxkomarychev/octions@master](https://github.com/maxkomarychev/octions) to add the label, any action that can add labels will suffice though, this is just an example.

You can use GitHub\'s [expressions syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#contains) to create a simple if-statement that will make a step only trigger if the currently closed issue was closed via a commit.

### Merge current branch with commit message

```yaml
```

### On labeled

Merge pull request branch using GitHub labels.

When you set a label in a pull request this action can merge the pull request branch to other branch, useful for develop branch or staging environments.

> All credits go to the initial release by [baked-libs/discord-webhook](https://github.com/baked-libs/discord-webhook).

This is a hard fork of the original Discord Webhook GitHub Action, which was specifically catered towards Java development. This is one a slightly more generic one where we just want to post commits via webhooks.

![preview](./docs/preview.png)

## :mailbox_with_no_mail: Inputs

### `webhook_url`

**Required** The GitHub webhook URL comprised of both `id` and `token` fields.

### `id`

> This is ignored if `webhook_url` is set

**Required** This is the id of your Discord webhook, if you copy the webhook url, this will be the first part of it.

### `token`

> This is ignored if `webhook_url` is set

**Required** Now your Discord webhook token, it's the second part of the url. 

### `censor_username`

Censor username with by only showing the first and last character. For example, `j...y` as `johnnyhuy`.

### `repo_name`

Specify a custom repository name to overwrite the `username/repo` format.

### `hide_links`

Hide links on embedded view.

### `color`

Color of the Discord embed.

## :scroll: Usage

To set up this Action, create a new workflow file under `.github/workflows/workflow_name.yml`.

```yaml
```

### Alternatives

```yaml
```

## Development

NodeJS should be the only hard requirement to get this project working to make changes. Optionally, we can use Docker Compose to provide this dependency in container with a volume to our host to make additional code changes.

```bash
```

### Versioning

Changes are versioned via GitHub Actions that use [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to create Git tags and [`conventional-github-releaser`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/releaser-tools/tree/master/packages/conventional-github-releaser) to submit GitHub releases.

We follow the [`Conventional Commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) standard where commit messages get *automatically* analysed to produce a generated semantic version.
","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
698,"# PR Labels Github Action

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A Github action that extracts labels from the PR that this build belongs to, and makes them available to other actions. Labels are available as step outputs and environment variables that you can use in later steps in your action.

## Outputs

### `labels`

The labels on this PR. A string containing tag identifiers surrounded with spaces for easy use with `contains`.

### `labels-object`

The labels on this PR. A dictionary containing `true` where a label exists.

## Example usage

```yaml
```

## How do I use this?

Perhaps you have a test that you only want to run when PR label `Test Flimbomble` is set. Your workflow should look like this:

```yaml

      # GITHUB_PR_LABEL_TEST_FLIMBOMBLE was set by pr-labels-action
      - run: |
          bin/run_normal_tests
          if [ -n ""$GITHUB_PR_LABEL_TEST_FLIMBOMBLE"" ]; then
            bin/run_flimbomble_tests
          fi

      # or you can use the action output.
      # For the label name, use lowercase kebab-case and surround with spaces
      - run: |

[![Builds, tests & co](https://github.com/fossa-contrib/fossa-action/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fossa-contrib/fossa-action/actions)
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B7767%2Fgithub.com%2Ffossa-contrib%2Ffossa-action.svg?type=small)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B7767%2Fgithub.com%2Ffossa-contrib%2Ffossa-action?ref=badge_small)

## Synopsis

The action sets up and caches the latest release of `fossa-cli`, infer the
correct configuration from the current system state, analyze the project for a
list of its dependencies, and upload the results to FOSSA.

## Roadmap

This action aims to provide an OS-neutral interface to `fossa-cli`, and so will
not add features that only work on one operating system. It will also track the
latest release of `fossa-cli`.

## Usage

### Push-only API token

If you are an open-source project maintainer, you probably want to check pull
requests from external contributors with FOSSA, but it's impossible to do with
secrets when the workflow runs on the pull request event due to GitHub's
constraints. However, FOSSA has the
[push-only API](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token)
token, allowing you to safely check pull requests.

There is no problem with this:

```yml
```

This will cause an error on the pull request event:

```yml
```

#### References

- https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token
- https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests

### How to specify the version

There is a point that is particularly easy to misunderstand. It's where you
specify the version of the action _itself_.

```yml
```

We recommend that you include the version of the action. We adhere to
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org), it's safe to use the major version
(`v1`) in your workflow. If you use the master branch, this could break your
workflow when we publish a breaking update and increase the major version.

```yml
```

### Example workflow

```yml
```

## Inputs

- `fossa-api-key`: This input is used to upload the results of the build
  analysis.
- `github-token`: This input is used to get the latest release of `fossa-cli`
  from GitHub API.
- `endpoint`: This input is used to specify which fossa endpoint to use.
- `skip-test`: This input is used to specify whether to execute
  [`fossa test`](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md/#fossa-test).
  This takes a long time, so it's set to `true` by default.

701,"# jsdoc-action

> A GitHub Action to build JSDoc documentation

This is a GitHub Action to build your JavaScript documentation with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc). This action can easily be combined with other deployment actions, in order to publish the generated documentation to for example [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). JSDoc [templates](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc#templates) are also supported.

The following example [workflow step](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) will generate documentation for all source files in the `./src` directory and output the built files to the `./out` directory.

```yml
```

## Supported platforms

The jsdoc-action is a JavaScript action and is supported on both Linux, MacOS and Windows. The action supports stable versions of Node.js 14 and later. 

| OS (runs-on) | ubuntu-latest | macos-latest | windows-latest |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Support | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |

## Options \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f

The following input variables options can/must be configured:

|Input variable|Necessity|Description|Default|
|----|----|----|----|
|`source_dir`|Optional|Source directory to build documentation from.||
|`output_dir`|Optional|Output folder for the generated documentation.|`./out`|
|`recurse`|Optional|Recurse into subdirectories when scanning for source files.|`false`|
|`config_file`|Optional|The path to a JSDoc configuration file.||
|`template`|Optional|The JSDoc template package to install. Will run `npm install template`.||
|`template_dir`|Optional|The relative location of the template files directory within the template package.||
|`front_page`|Optional|The path to a Markdown file to be used as a the front page. Normally `README.md`.||

## Templates \xf0\x9f\x92\x85

You can use JSDoc [templates](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc#templates) with this action.  
Just set the `template` input variable to the name of the template you want to use. This needs to be template's package name.

If the template's template files is located somewhere else than the package's root, you need to specify this. Set the `template_dir` input variable to the location of the template folder (contains a `publish.js` file).

For example, to use the JSDoc [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) template, set the `template` input variable to `ink-docstrap` and the `template_dir` to the string `template`.

## JSDoc Configuration file \xf0\x9f\x93\x84

To use a JSDoc [configuration file](https://jsdoc.app/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) located in your repository, you will need to specify the path to the file in the `config_file` input variable. Normally, if you use the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout), this will just resolve to `conf.json` or `conf.js`.

## Examples

### GitHub Pages \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80

An example for deploying JSDoc generated documentation to GitHub Pages with [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#table-of-contents).

This jsdoc-action workflow configuration uses the [Minami](https://github.com/nijikokun/minami) JSDoc template and uses the root `README.md` file as the front page.

702,"# Slack API Action
This action wraps the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) in an action to facilitate usage within workflows.

## Setup
This actions performs it\'s actions using a slack bot token. To acquire one you need to create a Slack App, add the Bot token scope permissions required for the api calls you intend to perform and install it into your workspace. Once this is done the workspace token is available on the permissions page of your app and you can start using this action. 

## Usage
Send a basic text message to a channel.
```
```

The `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable must be present and have the necessary permissions for the method being used.

By default the api method is [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) but you can define any other method suported by the [`@slack/web-api`](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api) package provided by the [Node Slack SDK](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/).

```
```

The args parameter expects a string in the JSON format with any parameter that the method accepts. This way any custom message formatting is allowed.

A more complex message:
```
```

## Development
To build the action simply run:
```
```

## ToDo
Custom predefined message formats might be added in the future if needed.

## **Ownership**

As of 2022/02/15 ownership of this project has been transferred to my personal `nick-fields` account due to me leaving InVision. Previously on 2021/04/28 ownership of this project was transferred from the `InVisionApp` organization to my work account `nick-invision` due to changes to our organization level security settings that conflicts with public GitHub Actions.  I am the author and have been the primary maintainer since day one and will continue to maintain this as needed.  

No immediate action is required if you rely on this as GitHub handles ownership transfers pretty well. Any current workflow reference to `nick-invision/private-action-loader@<whatever>` will still work, but will just pull from `nick-fields/private-action-loader@<whatever>` instead.  Who knows how long that will work, so at some point it would be beneficial to update your workflows to reflect the new owner accordingly.

704,"# get-gke-credentials

This action configures authentication to a [GKE cluster][gke] via a `kubeconfig` file that can be used with `kubectl` or other methods of interacting with the cluster.

Authentication is performed by generating a [short-lived token][token] (default behaviour) or via the [GCP auth plugin][gcp-auth-plugin] present in `kubectl` which uses the service account keyfile path in [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS][gcp-gcloud-auth].

**This is not an officially supported Google product, and it is not covered by a
Google Cloud support contract. To report bugs or request features in a Google
Cloud product, please contact [Google Cloud
support](https://cloud.google.com/support).**

## Prerequisites

This action requires:

-   Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to view a GKE cluster. See the
    Authorization section below for more information. You also need to
    [create a GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart).

-   This action runs using Node 16. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
    runners, you must use runner version [2.285.0](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)
    or newer.

-   If you plan to create binaries, containers, pull requests, or other
    releases, add the following to your .gitignore to prevent accidentially
    committing the KUBECONFIG to your release artifact:

    ```text
    # Ignore generated kubeconfig from google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials
    gha-kubeconfig-*
    ```

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Inputs

-   `cluster_name` - (Required) Name of the cluster for which to get
    credentials. If specified as a full resource name (e.g.
    ""projects/p/locations/l/clusters/c""), then then ""project_id"" and ""location""
    inputs are optional. If only specified as the name (e.g. ""my-cluster""), then
    the ""project_id"" and ""location"" inputs may be required.

-   `location` - (Optional) Location (e.g. region or zone) in which the cluster
    resides. This value is required unless you specify ""cluster_name"" as a full
    resource name.

-   `project_id` - (Optional) Project ID where the cluster is deployed. If
    provided, this will override the project configured by previous steps or
    environment variables. If not provided, the project will be inferred,
    best-effort.

-   `use_auth_provider` - (Optional) If true, use the Google Cloud auth plugin in
    kubectl instead of a short-lived access token. The default value is false.

-   `use_internal_ip` - (Optional) If true, use the internal IP address for the
    cluster endpoint. This is mostly used with private GKE clusters. The default
    value is false.

-   `use_connect_gateway` - (Optional) If true, uses the [Connect Gateway
    endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/gateway)
    to connect to the cluster. The default value is false.

-   `fleet_membership_name` - (Optional) Fleet membership name of form
    ""projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/memberships/MEMBERSHIP_NAME"" to use
    for generating the Connect Gateway endpoint. This only applies if
    ""use_connect_gateway"" is true. Defaults to auto discovery if empty.

-   `quota_project_id` - (Optional) Project ID from which to pull quota. The
    caller must have `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the project. If
    unspecified, this defaults to the project of the authenticated principle.
    This is an advanced setting, most users should leave this blank.

## Outputs

-   `kubeconfig_path` - Path on the local filesystem where the generated
    KUBECONFIG file resides.

-   Exports env var `KUBECONFIG` which is set to the generated `kubeconfig` file
    path.

## Authorization

There are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed
with **at least** the following roles:

- Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer (`roles/container.clusterViewer`)

If you are using the Connect Gateway, you must also have:

-   GKE Hub Viewer (`roles/gkehub.viewer`)


### Via google-github-actions/auth

Use [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) to authenticate the action. You can use [Workload Identity Federation][wif] or traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] authentication.
by specifying the `credentials` input. This Action supports both the recommended [Workload Identity Federation][wif] based authentication and the traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] based auth.

See [usage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#usage) for more details.

#### Authenticating via Workload Identity Federation

```yaml
```

#### Authenticating via Service Account Key JSON

```yaml
```

### Via Application Default Credentials

If you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,
you can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will
authenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This
only works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**

```yaml
```

The action will automatically detect and use the Application Default
Credentials.

## With Connect gateway

You can utilize the [Connect gateway][connect-gw] feature of [Fleets][fleets] with this action
to connect to clusters without direct network connectivity. This can be useful for connecting to [private clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept)
from GitHub hosted runners.

```yaml
```

Follow the [Connect gateway documentation][connect-gw] for initial setup.
Note: The Connect Agent service account must have the correct [impersonation policy][connect-gw-impersonation] on the service account used to authenticate this action.

## Versioning

We recommend pinning to the latest available major version:

```yaml
```

While this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we\'re ultimately
human and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you
can also pin to a specific version:

```yaml
```

However, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without
explicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions. There is **not** a floating alias for
`MAJOR.MINOR`.

705,"# Label Actions

Label Actions is a GitHub bot that performs certain actions when issues,
pull requests or discussions are labeled or unlabeled.

<img width=""800"" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dessant/label-actions/master/assets/screenshot.png"">

## Supporting the Project

The continued development of Label Actions is made possible
thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you\'d like to join them,
please consider contributing with
[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=label-actions&src=repo),
[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=label-actions&src=repo) or
[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=label-actions&src=repo).

## How It Works

The bot performs certain actions when an issue, pull request or discussion
is labeled or unlabeled. No action is taken by default and the bot
must be configured. The following actions are supported:

- Post comments
- Add labels
- Remove labels
- Close threads
- Reopen threads
- Lock threads
- Unlock threads

## Usage

1. Create the `.github/workflows/label-actions.yml` workflow file,
   use one of the [example workflows](#examples) to get started
2. Create the `.github/label-actions.yml` configuration file
   based on the [example](#configuring-labels-and-actions) below
3. Start labeling issues, pull requests and discussions

### Inputs

The bot can be configured using [input parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- **`github-token`**
  - GitHub access token, value must be `${{ github.token }}` or an encrypted
    secret that contains a [personal access token](#using-a-personal-access-token)
  - Optional, defaults to `${{ github.token }}`
- **`config-path`**
  - Configuration file path
  - Optional, defaults to `.github/label-actions.yml`
- **`process-only`**
  - Process label events only for issues, pull requests or discussions,
    value must be a comma separated list, list items must be
    one of `issues`, `prs` or `discussions`
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`

### Configuration

Labels and actions are specified in a configuration file.
Actions are grouped under label names, and a label name can be prepended
with a `-` sign to declare actions taken when a label is removed
from a thread. Actions can be overridden or declared only for issues,
pull requests or discussions by grouping them under the
`issues`, `prs` or `discussions` key.

#### Actions

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- **`comment`**
  - Post comments, value must be either a comment or a list of comments,
    `{issue-author}` is an optional placeholder
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`label`**
  - Add labels, value must be either a label or a list of labels
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`unlabel`**
  - Remove labels, value must be either a label or a list of labels
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`close`**
  - Close threads, value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`
- **`close-reason`**
  - Reason for closing threads, value must be:
    - `completed` or `not planned` for issues
    - `duplicate`, `outdated` or `resolved` for discussions
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`reopen`**
  - Reopen threads, value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`
- **`lock`**
  - Lock threads, value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`
- **`lock-reason`**
  - Reason for locking threads, value must be one
    of `resolved`, `off-topic`, `too heated` or `spam`,
    ignored for discussions
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`unlock`**
  - Unlock threads, value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`

## Examples

The following workflow will perform the actions specified
in the `.github/label-actions.yml` configuration file when an issue,
pull request or discussion is labeled or unlabeled.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Available input parameters

This workflow declares all the available input parameters of the app
and their default values. Any of the parameters can be omitted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          config-path: \'.github/label-actions.yml\'
          process-only: \'\'
```

### Ignoring label events

This step will process label events only for issues.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

This step will process label events only for pull requests and discussions.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

Unnecessary workflow runs can be avoided by removing the events
that trigger workflows from the workflow file instead.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Configuring labels and actions

Labels and actions are specified in a configuration file.
The following example showcases how desired actions may be declared:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

```yaml
```

  - required
  - GitHub Token using by Danger
  - recommendation value: `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

## Additional Example
```yml
```
danger-action can escape path of `Gemfile`. so you can put Gemfile on no-current directory.

## Attention: For repository OSS or using dependabot
`github-actions` token has not write permission at triggered by `pull_request` that created from forked repository or created by dependabot. This reason is for security

ref: [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)

In this case, danger cannot use GitHub API because readonly token. And, Using `pull_request_target` is an option, but it have the security concerns.

If your needs is report of lint-result, recommending [MeilCli/common-lint-reporter](https://github.com/MeilCli/common-lint-reporter). Its action resolve this problem by using `workflow_run`.

[![GitHub Action Build](https://github.com/coditory/changelog-parser-action/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coditory/changelog-parser-action/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/coditory/changelog-parser-action/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/coditory/changelog-parser-action?branch=master)

> A [GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/changelog-parser) that parses `CHANGELOG.md` written in [Keep a Changelog format](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog).

## Usage

### Inputs
- `path` (optional) - Path to the changelog file.
  - By default action will look for a changelog is standard locations (`changelog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, ...).
- `version` (optional) - Version of the changelog entry to parse.
  - By default the last released version is used. If changelog has no released versions, action will return an empty entry (no error raised).
  - When version is defined but not available in the changelog then an error is raised.

### Outputs
- `version` - Version from the changelog entry. Example: `2.1.0`.
- `versionMajor` - Major version part. Example: `2` for version `2.1.0`.
- `versionMinor` - Minor version part. Example: `1` for version `2.1.0`.
- `versionPatch` - Patch version part. Example: `0` for version `2.1.0`.
- `date` - Release date from the changelog entry. Example: `2020-08-22`.
- `status` - Status from the changelog entry. One of: (`prerelease`, `release`, `unreleased`).
- `description` - Content from the changelog entry found.

### Example
Typical `README.md` file:
```md
```

Action executed with no inputs
```bash
```

Action executed with input `version: 0.1.1`
```bash
```

## Sample usage in actions

### Trigger release process from CHANGELOG.md

Release steps are triggered when:
- it\'s a master branch
- changelog has different latest version then last published tag matching `v*`

This is just a sample action that uses java with gradle.

```yaml
```

### Create GitHub Release when new tag is pushed

This action simply creates a [GitHub Release](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) on a newly pushed tag matching `v*`.

```yaml
```

[![Docker build](https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata/workflows/Docker/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata/actions/workflows/docker.yaml)
[![Docker image size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata?sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated)

A Github Action to statically validate [Fastlane][fastlane] metadata for Android
([supply][supply]) using a simple validation logic written in Golang.

[fastlane]: https://docs.fastlane.tools
[supply]: https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/

## Features

- Zero config
- Supports GitHub file annotations
- Checks title, short description, full description and changelog texts
- Checks promo images
- Checks screenshots
- Optionally checks if Google Play supports provided locales
- Tiny docker image ~700KB
- Usable without GitHub actions

## Example Use Case

In one of my [Android projects][noice], I was facing a situation where other
developers would translate the metadata for the Android app. But, there was no
way to check its validity on a new Pull Request. I could create a dedicated CI
job to run the `fastlane supply` action with the `validate_only` option.
However,to run this job on PRs, I would need to expose a service account key for
accessing the Google Play Developer API. Needless to say that it would be a
security flaw.

This action uses a docker image built using a simple validation logic written in
Go. It validates the Fastlane metadata for Android against the constraints
enforced by Google Play.

[noice]: https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/noice

## Usage

_See [v1 README][v1-readme] if you\'re using v1._

[v1-readme]: https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata/blob/v1/README.md

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------: |
| `fastlaneDir`         | Directory where Fastlane Android metadata is located. It is the directory that contains individual locale directories. | `./fastlane/metadata/android` |
| `usePlayStoreLocales` | Throw an error if Google Play doesn\'t recognise a locale code. See [available languages][al] on Google Support.        |            `false`            |

[al]: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844778?hl=en#zippy=%2Cview-list-of-available-languages

### Without GitHub actions

The GitHub action runs a [docker image][dmg] under the hood. You can use it
directly for environments other than GitHub actions.

# tag-ur-it

A GitHub Action to automatically tag issues with labels and assignees based on a rules yml file in the repo

## Development

```sh
```

## Example Usage

First, set up an `issue_template.md` that encourages users to enter required information for our tool. See how this is done at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/issue_template.md).

For our example, we will use the following:

```
```

Next, set up a .yml file `issue-rules.yml` with rules in your repository. These rules should correspond to your issue template. See an example of how [Microsoft does this](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/issue-rules.yml).

The basic formatting of this yml file should be as follows:

```
```

Finally, setup your action workflow to run this action. Try out our routing (using this example) by opening up an issue in this repo!

```
```

## **Limitations**

- If running on self-hosted runner, NodeJS must be installed.

## **Ownership**

As of 2022/02/15 ownership of this project has been transferred to my personal account `nick-fields` from my work account `nick-invision` due to me leaving InVision.  I am the author and have been the primary maintainer since day one and will continue to maintain this as needed.

No immediate action is required if you rely on this as GitHub handles ownership transfers pretty well. Any current workflow reference to `nick-invision/assert-action@<whatever>` will still work, but will just pull from `nick-fields/assert-action@<whatever>` instead.  Who knows how long that will work, so at some point it would be beneficial to update your workflows to reflect the new owner accordingly.

717,"# Accelerate builds using buildcache

Use this GitHub Action to accelerate compilation in your GitHub workflows using [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache)

![Compilation Improvement Example](./docs/Buildcache_Example_Improvement.png)

## Usage

1. Workflow integration
1. Build integration
1. ??
1. Profit

### Workflow Integration

#### Default Style

The defaults fit most projects well.

The defaults definitely fit react-native projects well.

```yaml
```

- 500MB cache, cache is in `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, just needs build integration and you\'re set!

When using with `actions/checkout@v2`, add this action as a step after the checkout, or the `buildcache` binary will be clobbered in the post-job cleanup of the checkout action:

```yaml
```
#### Customize if you need to

All [buildcache options](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) are available to override via environment variables set in the workflow env area

A few options are used internally by this action, but if you override them this action will respect the override you have set.

```yaml
```

### Build Integration

buildcache is available now, but is unused until you call `clang` and`clang++` wrapped by buildcache.

Xcode puts `clang` and `clang++` on your `PATH` (in `/usr/bin`), and this action puts buildcache wrappers for it in your `PATH` first, before the normal Xcode ones.

This `PATH` manipulation is the key to an easy build integration.

You may rely on calling `clang` and `clang++` from `PATH` at all times, instead of via fully-specified paths. In environments where buildcache is availble, it will work. In environments that do not have buildcache, _it will still work_

#### Minimal change: override compiler on command line

If you want to isolate the integration to the Github Actions CI environment, run your Xcode build using specific overrides.

```sh
```

Here is [a real example of a project integrating it](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera/pull/131/files) this way

#### Maximum change: allow buildcache use everywhere

After seeing the acceleration, you may want to use buildcache locally as well (I do!)

This is possible if you change your project definition to override the compiler to use the value from `PATH` all the time. This should be backwards-compatible - it should still work on machines that do not have buildcache installed, but it is more intrusive because it changes your Xcode project file.

You can may do this via a `Podfile` hook like this:

```ruby
```

## Verification

How do you know it is working?

The overall buid time should make it obvious, but the real test is your cache hit/miss rate.

To verify things are working using the default configuration, look at the output of the workflow run, expand the ""Post buildcache"" step and check the statistics printed out. If you you ""Re-run jobs"" using the GitHub Actions web interface to re-run a job a second time, you _should_ see 100% hit rate, on quite a few objects.

The output of this repositories [react-native compile test action](https://github.com/mikehardy/buildcache-action/actions/workflows/react-native-build-test.yml) are a good example.

If you need more information, the default `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG` level of `2` is likely enough, you just need to add the `upload_buildcache_log` flag to your workflow integration and set it to `true`, then you may examine the actual output of buildcache as it worked, using the logfile attached as an artifact to the workflow run. If that still is not enough you may need a debug level of `1` See [Debugging Buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#debugging) for more information.

In practice, that is all I have needed to do to be certain the integration was successful in other projects.

## Benchmarks - 40-50% improvement

iOS compile performance improvements of approximately 40-50% may be expected when using this action

- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native-firebase app with all modules: 5min 52s (vs 10min)
- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native 0.64 demo app without Flipper: 2min 55s (vs 5min 20s)
- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native-vision-camera: [7min 13s (vs 13min 13s)](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/pull/131#issuecomment-832687144)

The _first_ build - the ""cold"" cache case - will be slower by around 15%, since buildcache has overhead to determine if it can use the cached object or not. On the cache miss case it then delegates to the compiler and stores the object for the next run which takes longer than a normal compile call.

If you experience low cache hit rates on a project with a largely static codebase (i.e., one that should be very cacheable and 2 runs with nearly no changes do not cache for some reason), you should definitely increase the debugging level for the buildcache log and examine stats output before and after each run. A common and easy fix may be as simple as increasing your cache size.

## Implementation Details

### Approach

This action does these things - if they interact poorly with your project, perhaps they could be altered slightly and made to work better if you propose a PR:

- fetches the latest version of [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache)
- installs it in your project directory as `buiildcache/bin/buildcache`
- makes symoblic links from `buildcache` to `clang` and `clang++`
- adds that directory to your `$GITHUB_PATH` for future steps
- configures the cache directory (defaults to `.buildcache` in your project directory if not set via environment variable)
- configures buildcache storage limit (defaults to 500MB if not set via environment variable)
- restores previous caches, and at the end saves the current one
- turns on `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG=2` if not set in environment variable
- will upload debug log if `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG` is not -1 and if `upload_buildcache_log` is true
- zeros cache stats by default after restore, so you get clean stats per-run, `zero_buildcache_stats` can disable it

### Things that don\'t work

- Direct mode did not work in testing when compiling react-native apps. Dependency files aren\'t created, but are needed. Direct mode is not enabled.
- `ccache` did not work when compiling react-native apps. It can\'t handle ""multiple source files"" so cache misses all the time.
- copying `buildcache` to `clang` and `clang++`, it has to be symbolic links. This means this is not quite a drop-in replacement on windows

## Contributing

If you set up a personal access token on GitHub, then export it as well as a couple other items, the whole thing runs well from a local mac for development.

```bash
```

I usually have two terminals open side by side, one with `yarn build-watch` and one to run `yarn test`

PRs are welcome. This action is new and is in the ""works for me"" and ""works for react-native-firebase"" state, so it _is_ useful, but maybe not generic enough to be useful for others yet.

## Inspiration + Gratitude

I work on [react-native-firebase](https://rnfirebase.io) and [FlutterFire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/) for [Invertase](https://invertase.io) and they have a truly inspiring dedication to automated testing. I sincerely love it, but...CI is slow for iOS testing!

I was inspired to try iOS compile acceleration after seeing [Codified](https://getcodified.com/services/) applying ccache with 10-20% improvements to CI Xcode builds, but it wasn\'t packaged up or redistributable

I then found [ccache-action](https://github.com/hendrikmuhs/ccache-action) - Henrik has done a great job there! Unfortunately in my testing with react-native projets ccache did not speed things up much because ccache misses cache on ""multiple_source_files"" compile calls, and that is seemingly all react-native projects do. `ccache-action` was the inspiration for this action though, thanks Hendrik!

Then I found [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache) and saw with a quick test I could achieve nearly 50% performance improvements

Combining the motivation to try it, the template of the idea already existing with ccache, and the good performance of buildcache and here we are.

<!-- ## Migrate to v2

### input `job` is now `title`

`job` input is deprecated and now removed in v2.

Just change `job` to `title` in your workflow file to make it work. -->

## Tips

### Using markdown

Some fields support markdown syntax.

```yaml
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33576079/212482315-52429bbd-b7b9-456a-8ee8-ee26aa2a0fb1.png)

### Mention to user/role

Since `@mention` inside the embed does not generate ping to users,
you can use `content` input to mention users/roles:

```yaml
    content: ""Hey <@316911818725392384>""
```

See the [Discord Developer Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting) for available formats.

### Trigger multiple webhooks

You can set multiple webhooks separated with EOL (line break, `\
`) to Secrets.

For example, set Secrets to:
```
```
will trigger these 3 webhooks simultaneously.

If some of these webhooks are failed, other deliveries will **NOT** be cancelled.

If the option `nofail` is set to `false` and any of one fail, the action will set
workflow status to `Failure`.

## Advanced Uses

### Proxy for Fork-based PRs

GitHub limits `GITHUB_TOKEN` and other API access token permissions when creating a PR from a fork. This precludes adding comments when your PRs are coming from forks, which is the norm for open source projects. To work around this situation I\'ve created a simple companion app you can deploy to Cloud Run or another host to proxy the create comment requests with a personal access token you provide.

See this issue: https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/4 for more details.

Check out the proxy service here: https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment-proxy

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Status Message Overrides

You can override your messages based on your job status. This can be helpful
if you don\'t anticipate having the data required to create a helpful message in
case of failure, but you still want a message to be sent to the PR comment.

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Multiple Message Files

Instead of directly setting the message you can also load a file with the text
of your message using `message-path`. `message-path` supports loading multiple
files and files on multiple lines, the contents of which will be concatenated.

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Find-and-Replace

Patterns can be matched and replaced to update comments. This could be useful
for some situations, for instance, updating a checklist comment.

Find is a regular expression passed to the [RegExp() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/RegExp). You can also
include modifiers to override the default `gi`.

**Example**

Original message:

```
```

Action:

```yaml
```

Final message:

```
```

Multiple find and replaces can be used:

**Example**

Original message:

```
```

Action:

```yaml
```

Final message:

```
```

It defaults to your resolved message (either from `message` or `message-path`) to
do a replacement:

**Example**

Original message:

```
```

Action:

```yaml
```

Final message:

```
```

### Bring your own issues

You can set an issue id explicitly. Helpful for cases where you want to post
to an issue but for some reason the event would not allow the id to be determined.

**Example**

> In this case `add-pr-comment` should have no problem finding the issue number
> on its own, but for demonstration purposes.

```yaml
```

## Configuration

1. Create an [Incoming Webhook](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) in your Slack workspace. Copy the webhook URL, you\'ll need it in the next step.
1. Create a [Github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in the settings tab in a repository, or organization if you want it to be used across all repositories within an organization. Give it the name ""SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"" and value as the webhook URL.

## Usage

1. Add ""SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"" as an [`env`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env) to every workflow file you want to use this action in.
    ```
    env:
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    ```
1. Add this action as a step and make sure to replace `x.y.z.` with a valid [release version](https://github.com/keithalpichi/slack-action/releases):
    ```
    - name: Send Slack Notification
      uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z
    ```
1. Add your desired inputs from the input section below to the step.

# base64-to-path

Use this action if you need to write a base64-encoded string to a path. This can be used for certificate signing when key is kept as a base64 GitHub Secret.

## Usage

724,"# Debug GitHub Action

**Name:** `hmarr/debug-action`

Print the environment variables and the event payload. Useful for developing or
debugging GitHub Actions.

Secrets are automatically filtered in the Actions logs.

**Important:** use v2.0.0 or later, as v1 was designed for the initial GitHub Actions beta, and may no longer work as expected.

## Usage instructions

Add a step with `- uses: hmarr/debug-action@v2` to a workflow file. Here\'s an example of a complete workflow file:

```yaml
```


## Example output (in the Actions logs)

```
```

That example is truncated a bit, but you get the idea.

## Development and release process

Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. `v1`, `v2`). The latest major
version (`v2` at the time of writing) is the repository\'s default branch.
Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. `v1.2.3`).

725,"# Setup the [Kotlin\xe2\x84\xa2](https://kotlinlang.org/) cli compiler in GitHub Actions

![build-test](https://github.com/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)
![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin)
![latest-version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin)

This action downloads the Kotlin\xe2\x84\xa2 compiler and installs it to the path.
It won\'t touch the installed JREs.

By default, the latest released version of Kotlin is installed.
This can be overriden via the `version` flag.

It allows you to use the `kotlinc` and the `kotlin` tool to compile source code and run scripts.

> :warning: **Note:** You probably don\'t need this action.
> GitHub now pre-installs Kotlin, if this works for you, there is no need to use this action.
> See [this issue](https://github.com/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin/issues/174) for more details.
> Furthermore, you don\'t need this action if you want to build a Kotlin project using Maven/Gradle as they will download the compiler for you.
> This action is useful if you need or want to use the `kotlin`/`kotlinc`/`kotlinc-native` cli tools, if you want to install a specific version of them or if you run workflows in a container/runner where Kotlin is not preinstalled.

See [this repo](https://github.com/fwilhe2/improved-enigma) for usage examples.

## Usage example

```yaml
```

### Kotlin/Native

You can also build os-native binaries using `kotlinc-native` as in this example:

```yaml
```

## Running a script inline

If you provide a string-argument `script`, the action will execute it via [`kotlin-main-kts` script definition jar](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-script-examples/blob/master/jvm/main-kts/MainKts.md), see this example:

```yaml
```

### Using `kotlin` as a shell

 Starting with version [`1.4.30`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.4.30), you can configure `kotlin` as a shell in Actions like in this example:
```yaml
```

See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-43534 and https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/813 for more details.
