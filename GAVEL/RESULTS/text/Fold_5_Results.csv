968,"# add-asset-to-release

Uploads an asset (e.g. a compiled binary) to an existing GitHub release. Expects to be run as part of a workflow
triggered by the release. Will fail if it isn't because it reads the release id from the payload of the triggering
event.

Written in JavaScript, so it can be used by any runner type.

970,"# Puppeteer Headful

[Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) that can be ran ""headful"" or not headless.

> Versioning of this container is based on the version of NodeJS in the container

## Purpose

This container is available to Github Action because there are some situations, mostly testing [Chrome Extensions](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v1.18.1&show=api-working-with-chrome-extensions), where you can not run Puppeteer in headless mode.

## Usage

This action installs Puppeteer on top of a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) container, so you have access to run [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) scripts using args. For this hook, we hijack the entry point of the [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), so we can start up [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) before your testing starts.

```yaml
```

> Note: You will need to let Puppeteer know not to download Chromium. By setting the env of your install task to PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD = \'true\' so it does not install conflicting versions of Chromium.

Then you will need to change the way you launch Puppeteer. We export out a nifty ENV variable `PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH` that you set at your `executablePath`. This should be undefined locally so it should function perfectly fine locally and on the action.

## Introduction

We built ChangeCast to help communicate project updates to users. Whether the project is an open source library or a paid website, users want to know about the hard work being done! Keeping a changelog [is important](https://keepachangelog.com), but the other half of the battle is making that changelog available to users.

ChangeCast uses your [Github Releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to build a static site and widget that can be added to your application or project homepage. Check out the [examples on our homepage](https://changecast.now.sh) or get started deploying your own ChangeCast below.

## Getting Started

### Step One: Deploy

#### Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are the easiest way to deploy ChangeCast for your project.

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

##### 1. Add the ChangeCast Action

```HCL
```

Note that `URL` is necessary for SEO and Open Graph tags to work properly, but ChangeCast will build without it. You can skip this for your first deployment, and redeploy once you know the deployment URL.

##### 2. Add a static deployment Action

In the example below we are using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), but any static deployment action should work. Simply configure the action to deploy the `./changecast` directory that is created by the ChangeCast Action.

```HCL
```

Note that you can generate a new `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` by installing the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli) and running `netlify sites:create`.

As a bonus you can also try the [Chronicler Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/chronicler-action) to help you draft release notes from PR titles.

For a full working example of deploying ChangeCast using Github Actions, check out our [main.workflow](https://github.com/palmerhq/changecast/blob/master/.github/main.workflow).

</details>

#### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is the next easiest way to deploy ChangeCast for your project.

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

##### 1. Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/palmerhq/changecast)

You will be prompted for the following information:

- **Github repository url**: Enter the url of a Github repository _(e.g. https://github.com/facebook/react)_.
- **Github access token (optional for public repos)**: [Generate](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and enter an access token with `repo` scope.

After deploying, you can assign a custom domain for your changelog [using Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/).

##### 2. Add a Build Trigger

In order to rebuild whenever a Github release is published, we want to add a webhook for Github releases to Netlify. The steps to do so are:

1. In your Netlify site\'s ""Build & deploy"" settings, find the ""Github Releases"" build hook and copy the URL displayed.
2. Create a webhook in the Github repository (https://github.com/{owner}/{name}/settings/hooks/new).
3. Paste the URL from step 1 into the Github webhook\'s ""Payload URL"".
4. In the Github webhook under ""Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?"", select ""Let me select individual events."" and ""Releases"".

You\'re all set! Now your changelog page and widget will rebuild whenever a new release is published.

</details>

### Step Two: Embed Widget

First, add the following `script` tag to your site header. `DEPLOY_URL` should be the deployment URL of your ChangeCast site.

```html
```

Next, add the `data-toggle-changecast` attribute to any clickable elements that you want to toggle the ChangeCast widget.

```html
```

This is a `GitHub Actions` that automates the release of `GitHub Actions`.  
Once you create a new tag, this action will automatically
1. Run build
1. Create branch for release
1. Change [tags](#tags) to release branch
1. If there is release which has same tag name and has been published, re-publish it (Because if the tag is changed, the release will be in a draft state).

## Execute commands
### Build
- If package.json includes `prepare`, `build`, `production`, `prod`, `package` or `pack` in scripts, the commands are used for build. (You can change this with [BUILD_COMMAND_TARGET](#options))  
- If command does not have install command like `npm run install` or `yarn install`, install commands are added.  

so if `BUILD_COMMAND` is not provided and package.json has `build` script,
the following commands are executed for build.

```shell
```

If `build` and `pack` are included, the commands are:
                            
```shell
```

### Delete files
To execute `GitHub Actions`, `src files used for build`, `test files`, `test settings`, etc. are not required.  
And `GitHub Actions` is downloaded every time when it is used, so fewer files are better.  

`CLEAN_TARGETS` option is used for this purpose.  
default: `.[!.]*,__tests__,docs,src,*.[jt]s,*.[mc][jt]s,*.json,*.lock,*.yml,*.yaml`  

```shell
```

(action.yml is not subject to deletion.)

## Action event details
### Target events
| eventName: action | condition |
|:---:|:---:|
|push: *|[condition](#condition)|
|release: published|[condition](#condition)|
|create: *|[condition](#condition)|

### condition
- tags
  - semantic versioning tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
  - [test tag](#options) (e.g. `test/v1.2.3`)

## Motivation
Releasing `GitHub Actions` needs all build files and dependencies like `node_modules`, but are not usually committed.  
So if you want to release `GitHub Actions`, you have to do following steps.  
1. Develop locally on the branch for develop
1. Build for release
1. Commit all source code including dependencies like `node_modules` to branch for release
1. Add tags (consider major, minor and patch versions)
1. Push to GitHub
1. Publish release

It is very troublesome to do this steps for every release.  

If you use this `GitHub Actions`, the steps to do are simpler.
1. Develop locally on the branch for develop
1. Publish release (Create tag)
1. Wait for the automated steps to finish
   1. Build for release
   1. Commit all source code including dependencies like `node_modules` to branch for release
   1. Add tags (consider major, minor and patch versions)
   1. Push to GitHub

## Addition
### Tags 
Tag name format must be [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  
The following tags will be created.
- tag name
- major tag name (generated by tag name)
  - e.g. `v1`
- minor tag name (generated by tag name)
  - e.g. `v1.2`
- patch tag name (generated by tag name)
  - e.g. `v1.2.3`

973,"# cspell-action

Uses [cspell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell/tree/main/packages/cspell) to check code.

## Installation

Example `spellcheck.yaml`

```yaml
```

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Yarn 2 - PlugNPlay

To use dictionaries stored within a Yarn 2 workspace, there are two choices:

1. Add `""usePnP"": true` to the workspace `cspell.json` file. This tells `cspell` to search for the
   nearest `.pnp.js` or `.pnp.cjs` file and load it.

Example for medical terms:

```js
```

2. Require the `.pnp.js` or `.pnp.cjs` in a `cspell.config.js` file.
   This must be done before importing any packages.

```js
```

## Outputs

```yaml
```

Example Output:

```json

## What\'s inside?

With this Expo action, you have full access to [Expo CLI][link-expo-cli] and [EAS CLI][link-eas-cli].
It lets you automate the `expo publish` or `eas build` commands, leaving you with more time to work on your project.
Some additional features are included to make the usage of this action as simple as possible, like caching and authentication.

## Configuration options

> Create your [`EXPO_TOKEN`][link-expo-token] GitHub secret.

This action is customizable through variables defined in the [`action.yml`](action.yml).
Here is a summary of all the input options you can use.

## Example workflows

Before diving into the workflow examples, you should know the basics of GitHub Actions.
You can read more about this in the [GitHub Actions documentation][link-actions].

1. [Create new EAS Update on push to main](#create-new-eas-update-on-push-to-main)
2. [Create new EAS build on push to main](#create-new-eas-build-on-push-to-main)
3. [Create previews on PRs](#create-previews-on-prs)

### Create new EAS Update on push to main

This workflow listens to the `push` event on the `main` branch.
It sets up all required components to publish the app, including authentication with a [token][link-expo-token].

> Always use [secrets][link-actions-secrets] when using tokens.

```yml
```

### Creating new EAS build on push to main

This action also allows you to install the EAS CLI.
To do this, add the **eas-version** property, and the action will install it.
We recommend using `latest` for the EAS CLI.

> The [**token**][link-expo-token] is shared for both Expo and EAS CLI.

```yml
```

### Create previews on PRs

Reviewing pull requests can take some time.
The reviewer needs to check out the branch, install the changes, and run the bundler to review the results.
You can also automatically publish the project for the reviewer to skip those manual steps.

> See the [preview docs](./preview#create-previews-on-pull-requests) for more information.

```yml
```

## Things to know

### Automatic Expo login

Some Expo commands, like `expo publish` and `eas build`, require you to be authenticated.
This action exports the [**token**][link-expo-token] to ensure you are authenticated in every workflow step.

> Note, this action does not store the [token][link-expo-token] anywhere. Each separate workflow job needs to set up the [**token**][link-expo-token] individually.

### Using the built-in cache

You can opt-out from caching the Expo and EAS CLI installations.
Under the hood, it uses the [`@actions/cache`][link-actions-cache-package] package to restore a previous install.
It reduces the installation time because it only needs to download and extract a single tar file.

> Note, using cache will count towards your [repo cache limit][link-actions-cache-limit]. Both the Expo and EAS CLI are stored in different caches.

### ENOSPC errors on Linux

Creating new bundles with Metro can be memory intensive.
In the past, some builds resulted in `ENOSPC` errors.
To prevent anyone from running into this, we make sure Ubuntu has sensible defaults in terms of file system availability.
You can opt-out from patching the file system by setting **patch-watchers** to `false`.

# snyk/release-notes-preview #

## Summary ##

GitHub Action to provide preview of expected release notes based on [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
The preview would be posted on every pull request opened against the desired branch(es).
A _pending_ commit status titled `Release Notes Confirmation` would be created when initially posting the release notes.
The commit status would change to _success_ once the checkbox at the bottom of the release notes preview is checked.

## Setup ##

Create a file with the following content under `.github/workflows/release-notes.yaml`:

```
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

# Repo File Sync Action

[![Build CI](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/workflows/Test%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+CI%22) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/blob/master/LICENSE) ![David](https://img.shields.io/david/betahuhn/repo-file-sync-action)

Keep files like Action workflows or entire directories in sync between multiple repositories.

</div>

## \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Introduction

With [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) you can sync files, like workflow `.yml` files, configuration files or whole directories between repositories or branches. It works by running a GitHub Action in your main repository everytime you push something to that repo. The action will use a `sync.yml` config file to figure out which files it should sync where. If it finds a file which is out of sync it will open a pull request in the target repository with the changes.

## \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features

- Keep GitHub Actions workflow files in sync across all your repositories
- Sync any file or a whole directory to as many repositories as you want
- Easy configuration for any use case
- Create a pull request in the target repo so you have the last say on what gets merged
- Automatically label pull requests to integrate with other actions like [automerge-action](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action)
- Assign users to the pull request
- Render [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)-style templates as use variables thanks to [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x9a Usage


### Workflow

Create a `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` folder (you can find more info about the structure in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)):

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
```

#### Token

In order for the Action to access your repositories you have to specify a [Personal Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) as the value for `GH_PAT` (`GITHUB_TOKEN` will **not** work). The PAT needs the full repo scope ([#31](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/discussions/31#discussioncomment-674804)).

It is recommended to set the token as a
[Repository Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

Alternatively, you can provide the token of a GitHub App Installation via the `GH_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` input. You can obtain such token for example via [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-app-token) action. Tokens from apps have the advantage that they provide more granular access control.

The app needs to be configured for each repo you want to sync to, and have the `Contents` read & write and `Metadata` read-only permission. If you want to use PRs (default setting) you additionally need `Pull requests` read & write access, and to sync workflow files you need `Workflows` read & write access.

If using an installation token you are required to provide the `GIT_EMAIL` and `GIT_USERNAME` input.

### Sync configuration

The last step is to create a `.yml` file in the `.github` folder of your repository and specify what file(s) to sync to which repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
```

More info on how to specify what files to sync where [below](#%EF%B8%8F-sync-configuration).

### Versioning

To always use the latest version of the action add the `latest` tag to the action name like this:

```yml
```

If you want to make sure that your workflow doesn\'t suddenly break when a new major version is released, use the `v1` tag instead (recommended usage):

```yml
```

With the `v1` tag you will always get the latest non-breaking version which will include potential bug fixes in the future. If you use a specific version, make sure to regularly check if a new version is available, or enable Dependabot.

## \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f Action Inputs

Here are all the inputs [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) takes:

| Key | Value | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `GH_PAT` | Your [Personal Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) | **`GH_PAT` or `GH_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` required** | N/A |

### Outputs

The action sets the `pull_request_urls` output to the URLs of any created Pull Requests. It will be an array of URLs to each PR, e.g. `\'[""https://github.com/username/repository/pull/number"", ""...""]\'`.

## \xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Sync Configuration

In order to tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) what files to sync where, you have to create a `sync.yml` file in the `.github` directory of your main repository (see [action-inputs](#%EF%B8%8F-action-inputs) on how to change the location).

The top-level key should be used to specify the target repository in the format `username`/`repository-name`@`branch`, after that you can list all the files you want to sync to that individual repository:

```yml
```

There are multiple ways to specify which files to sync to each individual repository.

### List individual file(s)

The easiest way to sync files is the list them on a new line for each repository:

```yml
```

### Different destination path/filename(s)

Using the `dest` option you can specify a destination path in the target repo and/or change the filename for each source file:

```yml
```

### Sync entire directories

You can also specify entire directories to sync:

```yml
```

### Exclude certain files when syncing directories

Using the `exclude` key you can specify files you want to exclude when syncing entire directories (#26).

```yml
    exclude: |
      node.yml
      lint.yml
```

> **Note:** the exclude file path is relative to the source path

### Don\'t replace existing file(s)

By default if a file already exists in the target repository, it will be replaced. You can change this behaviour by setting the `replace` option to `false`:

```yml
```

### Using templates

You can render templates before syncing by using the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)-style template syntax. It will be compiled using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and the output written to the specific file(s) or folder(s).

Nunjucks supports variables and blocks among other things. To enable, set the `template` field to a context dictionary, or in case of no variables, `true`:

```yml
```

In the source file you can then use these variables like this:

```yml
```

Result:

```yml
```

You can also use `extends` with a relative path to inherit other templates. Take a look at Nunjucks [template syntax](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) for more info.

```yml
```

```yml
```

### Delete orphaned files

With the `deleteOrphaned` option you can choose to delete files in the target repository if they are deleted in the source repository. The option defaults to `false` and only works when [syncing entire directories](#sync-entire-directories):

```yml
    deleteOrphaned: true
```

It only takes effect on that specific directory.

### Sync the same files to multiple repositories

Instead of repeating yourself listing the same files for multiple repositories, you can create a group:

```yml
```

You can create multiple groups like this:

```yml
```

### Syncing branches

You can also sync different branches from the same or different repositories (#51). For example, a repository named `foo/bar` with branch `main`, and `sync.yml` contents:

```yml
```

Here all files in `.github/workflows/` will be synced from the `main` branch to the branches `de`/`es`/`fr`.

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x96 Examples

Here are a few examples to help you get started!

### Basic Example

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
```

### Sync all workflow files

This example will keep all your `.github/workflows` files in sync across multiple repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
```

### Custom labels

By default [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) will add the `sync` label to every PR it creates. You can turn this off by setting `PR_LABELS` to false, or specify your own labels:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
    with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    PR_LABELS: |
      file-sync
      automerge
```

### Assign a user to the PR

You can tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) to assign users to the PR with `ASSIGNEES`:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
    with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    ASSIGNEES: BetaHuhn
```

### Request a PR review

You can tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) to request a review of the PR from users with `REVIEWERS` and from teams with `TEAM_REVIEWERS`:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
    with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    REVIEWERS: |
      BetaHuhn
      BetaHuhnBot
    TEAM_REVIEWERS: engineering
```

### Custom GitHub Enterprise Host

If your target repository is hosted on a GitHub Enterprise Server you can specify a custom host name like this:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
```

> **Note:** The key has to start with http to indicate that you want to use a custom host.

### Different branch prefix

By default all new branches created in the target repo will be in the this format: `repo-sync/SOURCE_REPO_NAME/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`, with the SOURCE_REPO_NAME being replaced with the name of the source repo and SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME with the name of the source branch.

If your repo name contains invalid characters, like a dot ([#32](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/issues/32)), you can specify a different prefix for the branch (the text before `/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`):

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    BRANCH_PREFIX: custom-branch
```

The new branch will then be `custom-branch/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`.

> You can use `SOURCE_REPO_NAME` in your custom branch prefix as well and it will be replaced with the actual repo name

### Custom commit body

You can specify a custom commit body. This will be appended to the commit message, separated by two new lines. For example:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
    with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    COMMIT_BODY: ""Change-type: patch""
```

The above example would result in a commit message that looks something like this:
```
```

### Add content to the PR body

You can add more content to the PR body with the `PR_BODY` option. For example:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
    with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    PR_BODY: This is your custom PR Body
```

It will be added below the first line of the body and above the list of changed files. The above example would result in a PR body that looks something like this:

```
```

### Fork and pull request workflow

If you do not wish to grant this action write access to target repositories, you can specify a bot/user Github acccount that you do have access to with the `FORK` parameter. 

A fork of each target repository will be created on this account, and all changes will be pushed to a branch on the fork, instead of upstream. Pull requests will be opened from the forks to target repositories.

Note: while you can open pull requests to target repositories without write access, some features, like applying labels, are not possible.

```yml
with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    FORK: file-sync-bot
```

### Advanced sync config

Here\'s how I keep common files in sync across my repositories. The main repository [`github-files`](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/github-files) contains all the files I want to sync and the [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) Action which runs on every push.

Using groups I can specify which file(s) should be synced to which repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
```

``not-grep`` is kind of like grep, but different.

WAT?
====

If you have ever needed to inspect a file for particular patterns,
you probably used ``grep``.

.. code-block:: bash

    grep FooClassName file.py

If you needed to do that for a lot of files, you might have combined it with ``find``.

.. code-block:: bash

    find . -type f -name ""*.py"" -exec grep -n FooClassName {} /dev/null \\;

This works great for one-off checks
but less great if you need to do those checks repeatedly,
if you need to do lots of such checks,
if you need to do those checks somewhere that you don\'t have access to ``grep``,
or if you need to do things that ``grep`` cannot do.

Not Grep?
=========

``not-grep`` is designed for static use, not ad-hoc use.
For example, as part of a continuous integration test suite.
This is why it gets its configuration from a config file, not the CLI.
Because of this, the ``not-grep`` CLI is very simple:
the only things you can specify are the config file and verbosity.

.. code-block:: bash

    not-grep --config config.toml -vv

Inside the config file, things start to get interesting.

``not-grep`` is built around checker plugins.
Each plugin takes a map as input:
the file glob pattern for the files you want to check
and a value that tells the plugin what to do with that file.

The config file is a collection of TOML tables.
The table name identifies the plugin
and the table members are the input to that plugin.

.. code-block:: toml

    # The ""include"" checker will error unless the specified value is include.
    [include]
    ""src/**/*.py"" = ""__all__""

    # The ""exclude"" checker will error if the specified value is include.
    [exclude]
    ""src/**/*.py"" = ""FooClassName""


The output shows you, for each plugin,
whether each matched file met or failed the plugin requirements.
In lower verbosity levels, ``not-grep`` only shows failed checks.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ not-grep --config config.toml -vv

# Label Sync Action [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2e47ea97e1e546afab645674825e0122)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/srealmoreno/label-sync-action/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=srealmoreno/label-sync-action&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Label Sync Action is a simple action that syncs labels to a GitHub repository or
list of repositories.

Manage all tags from all your repositories in a single place.

## \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Getting Started

### Create a config file \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d

The default file path is `.github/labels.yml`, but you can specify a different path
see options below.

How to create a config file:

- Create a JSON or YAML file, with one of these extensions: `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.yaml`,
  `.yml`.
- Every label should be an array element: add some square brackets `[]` if you need
  to.
- Every element of the array should be an object with the following properties:
  - `name` - The name of the label.
  - `color` - The color of the label.
  - `description` - [optional] The description of the label.
  - `aliases` - [optional] An array containing the ""aliases"" of the label. If an
    existing label\'s name is an alias that label will be edited to match your config:
    this way you don\'t loose issues and PRs that have been labeled previously.

```yaml
```

> The `#` in color it\'s optional.

```jsonc
```

> The `#` in color it\'s optional.

### Create a workflow \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d

Sample basic workflow:

```yaml
```

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x8b Usage

### Sync labels to a list of repositories \xf0\x9f\x93\xa6

Specify a repository or a list of repositories

```yaml
```

> Note: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not have permissions to
> write labels on other repositories so you must specify a [Personal Access Token]
> with access to repositories.

### Get Labels of url \xf0\x9f\x94\x97

It\'s possible to get the labels of url.
If you use only url, the `actions/checkout@v3` step is not necessary

```yaml
```

### Auto Discover Repositories \xf0\x9f\x94\x8d

If you have a very large list of repositories and you want to have the same
tags in all repositories you can use the `auto-discover-repos` option.

```yaml
```

980,"# Closed Reference Notifier Action

A GitHub action to open an issue when GitHub references in your code are closed.
These could be references to open pull requests or issues.

Quite often you will have references like this one in your code:

```js
```

You will then either have to remind yourself to check back or (more likely) you
will stumble across the comment some time later to manually check whether the
issue got fixed. This simple GitHub actions searches your whole repository for
references to GitHub pulls and issues. When it finds a closed reference it will
open an issue in your repository. That way you will automatically be reminded to
check back on the reference.

## Configuration

Please note that this action has to run on node.js 14, which is currently only
possible using a workaround. Therefore, you have to make sure this action runs
on a sufficient node version, e.g. by using this minimal job config:

```yaml
```

We recommend having this action run regularly e.g. daily. To enable access to
the GitHub API you have to set the token input (see below).

All other inputs are optional.

| Key         | Description                                                    | Default value    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ignore      | ignore paths, comma seperated list of .gitignore style entries | .git             |
| issueLabels | the labels to create issues with, comma seperated list         | closed reference |
| issueLimit  | the maximum number of issues to create, supposed to catch bugs | 5                |

Additionally to setting `ignore` as an input, you can also place a
`.reference-ignore` file in the root of your repo (entries should be `\
`
separated). Both, the input and the file will be concatenated.

Individual references can be marked as intentional by placing two exclamation
marks immediately behind the reference:

```js
```

Note that the action fails when there are more issues to be created than the
limit allows. This is because GitHub Actions do not have manual approval.

Verbose example with all inputs:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: ""0 7 * * *""

          ignore: .git
          issueLabels: closed reference
          issueLimit: 5
```

## Testing manually before automating

To manually test what references this action finds you can run

<!-- update when published to npm https://github.com/ory/closed-reference-notifier/issues/13 -->

```
```

## Manual workflow trigger

To allow for easy temporary issue limit raising, we recommend you add the
following manual trigger:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issueLimit:
        description: maximum number of issues to create
        required: true
        default: ""5""

          # fall back to 5 when the issueLimit is not available (e.g. with a scheduled event)
          issueLimit: ${{ github.event.inputs.issueLimit || \'5\' }}
```

This GitHub Action can be used to **impersonate** a GitHub App when `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`\'s limitations are too restrictive and a personal access token is not suitable. [`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) has limitations such as [not being able to triggering a new workflow from another workflow](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Triggering-a-new-workflow-from-another-workflow/td-p/31676). A workaround is to use a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) from a [personal user/bot account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts). However, for organizations, GitHub Apps are [a more appropriate automation solution](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/#machine-vs-bot-accounts).

We can also use an app token to [custom an action\'s name and avatar](https://github.community/t/change-bots-name-avatar/18349).

![screenshot](https://github.com/wow-actions/use-app-token/blob/master/screenshots/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

## Usage

Before staring, we should get our owned app\'s _""APP ID""_ and _""Private Key""_ in the app\'s setting page. For example, find the two values in my app\'s setting page [https://github.com/settings/apps/wow-actions-bot](https://github.com/settings/apps/wow-actions-bot).

Get your owned app\'s _""APP ID""_

![get-app-id](https://github.com/wow-actions/use-app-token/blob/master/screenshots/get-app-id.jpg?raw=true)

Get or create a _""Private Key""_

![get-private-key](https://github.com/wow-actions/use-app-token/blob/master/screenshots/get-private-key.jpg?raw=true)

**Do not have a Github App? Get a quick start with [probot](https://probot.github.io/).**

Then add _""APP ID""_ and _""Private Key""_ to the target [repo\'s secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). For example, we can add two secrets named `APP_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY` with corresponding values.

![secrets](https://github.com/wow-actions/use-app-token/blob/master/screenshots/secrets.jpg?raw=true)

Now we can config our workflows.

### Method 1: Use action\'s output in the next steps

```yml
```

### Method 2: Use environment variables in the next steps

```yml
```

### Method 3: Use secrets in the next steps

```yml
```

### Inputs

Various inputs are defined to let you configure the action:

983,"# Dockerfile updater action

_It might not be pretty, but it does a good enough job, this one is for the lazy maintainer._

This will scan your repository for dockerfiles and update pinned versions in them, so you as a maintainer can just sit back and merge PR\'s.

If an update is found, that will be committed to a new branch and a pull request will be opened.


## Configuration options

Key | Optional | Default | Description
-- | -- | -- | --
`token` | False |  | GitHub token to use in the action `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
`pr_title` | True | `Dockerfile updates \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89` | The title of the PR\'s this action creates.
`dockerfile_name` | True | `dockerfile` | This action run on all files that contains this value.
`exclude_type` | True |  | A comma separated string of types you don\'t want to check
`exclude_package` | True | | A comma separated string of packages you don\'t want to check
`commit_msg` | True | `""Update [package] from [from_version] to [to_version]""` | The string used in commit messages.
`args` | True | | A comma separated string of ARG key/value pairs. i.e. \'ARG1=""VALUE1"",ARG2=""VALUE2\'
`disable_pr` | True | False | Disables auto creation of Pull Request.

### Valid types for `exclude_type`

Type | Description
-- | --
`base` | For base image updates
`apk` | For alpine package updates
`pip` | For PyPi pacakge updates

## Recommended action configuration

_It is recommended to run this action with a cron trigger._

```yaml
```

_This will run 4:40 PM every day._

## What is updated now

- Your base image (FROM) if you use `alpine` / `debian`
- Packages from PyPi.
- Alpine packages you install with `apk add`
- Special ARG variables, (formats: `ARG S6_OVERLAY=""vX.X.X""` / `ARG MYARG`).

## Planed for the future

- Debian packages you install with `apt install`
- More base images.

# Buy Me A Coffee Donations and Messages on your Readme page


## It will look like this:

![./assets/buy-me-a-coffee-outfit.png](./assets/buy-me-a-coffee-outfit.png)

## Prerequisites

In order to set this action, you need to have the followings:
1. A Buy-Me-A-Coffee token
2. A github token (it will be generated automatically)

## Setup

1. Edit your README.md file and add two lines as follows: 
```md
```

These lines won\'t be shown in the generated Readme file (because they are comments in HTML), but they will specify the concrete place where the list of the latest donations should be inserted. Please note that anything between these two lines will be removed by the newly generated list when the action is triggered.

2. Create a Token in [Buy Me A Coffee developer page](https://developers.buymeacoffee.com/dashboard)

- 2.1 Login to the Developers page

- 2.2 Click to create new Token

- 2.3 Name your token and click to Create

- 2.4 Copy the code generated (your token) to the clipboard

3. Set the Buy Me A Coffee Token as a github Secret

- 3.1 Navigate to the repository in where you would like to use this action

- 3.2 Go to Settings and then click to Secrets/Actions at the left menu

- 3.3 Click to \'New repository Secret\' button

- 3.4 Name the secret exactly `BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_TOKEN`

- 3.5 Paste your Buy Me A Coffee Token from your clipboard and then Save. You should see something like this: 
  
4. Set a workflow in your repository by following the next steps:

- 4.1 Go to your project\'s `actions`, hit `New workflow` and `set up a workflow yourself`, then delete all the default content.
- 4.2 Copy-Paste the code below to your new workflow file and save/commit it as `buy-me-a-coffee.yml`.

   ```yml
   name: Buy Me A Coffee Readme

   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     schedule:
       # Runs at every 12AM UTC
       - cron: ""0 0 * * *""

   jobs:
     bmac-readme:
       name: Update Buy Me A Coffee section in this repo\'s README
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: akosbalasko/coffee-readme@main
           with:
             BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_TOKEN }}
             GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

### Extra Options
- You can specify the number of the messages to be added into the readby by setting `NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES` property. By default it is 3.
- You can specify the branch in where the readme should be pushed by setting `BRANCH`\xc2\xa0property. Default is `main`.

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x8b Common issues

### The action fails on the Dependabot pull requests

Due to the security reasons from March 1st, 2021 workflow runs that are triggered by Dependabot have permissions reduced by default:

- [GitHub Actions: Workflows triggered by Dependabot PRs will run with read-only permissions](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/)

To ensure that sufficient permissions for this action are always granted, you will need to add `permissions` entry to the job which runs `npm-lockfile-changes`:

```yml
```

## \xf0\x9f\x94\x8d\xef\xb8\x8f Debugging

To run action in the debug mode you need to add the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` repository secret and set it to `true`, as stated in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging#enabling-step-debug-logging).

Then additional information which might be useful for the users when debugging the issues will be available in the action output, prefixed by `##[debug]`.

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/baptiste0928/cargo-install)
[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)
[![CI](https://github.com/baptiste0928/cargo-install/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/baptiste0928/cargo-install/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This action enables you to run `cargo install` in your GitHub workflows,
and automatically caches the resulting binaries to speed up subsequent builds.

| \xe2\x9c\xa8 Recent updates: |
| :--- |
| **v2.1:** Installing crates from git is now supported. |
| **v2.0:** This major update introduces some breaking changes. Read the [changelog] before updating. |

## Features
- Install any Rust binary crate from [crates.io] or a git repository.
- Automatically cache installed binaries to avoid compiling them each run.
- Keep crates updated, with an optional version range to avoid breakages.
- Works on Linux, Windows and MacOS runners.

## Usage
The following example steps install the [`cargo-hack`] and [`cargo-sort`] crates.
Read [Quickstart for GitHub Actions] to learn more about Actions usage.

```yaml
```

If no version or branch/tag/commit is specified, the latest version will be
installed. The `--locked` flag is added by default to avoid breakages due to
unexpected dependencies updates.

### Input parameters
- `crate` *(required)*: Name of the crate to install.
- `version`: Version to install (defaults to the latest version). Supports any
  semver range. Only used when installing from crates.io, see below for git
  installation.
- `features`: Space or comma-separated list of crate features to enable.
- `locked`: Use the crate `Cargo.lock` if available (enabled by default).
  This adds `--locked` to the install command arguments.
- `args`: Additional arguments to pass to `cargo install`.
- `cache-key`: Additional string added to the cache key used to manually
  invalidate the cache.

#### Git parameters
- `git`: URL of the git repository to install from.
- `branch`: Branch to install from.
- `tag`: Tag to install from.
- `commit`/`rev`: Commit hash to install from.

`branch`, `tag` and `commit`/`rev` are mutually exclusive. If none of them are
specified, the latest commit of the default branch will be used.

### Outputs
- `version`: The version of the crate that has been installed.
- `cache-hit`: A boolean indicating whether the crate was restored from cache.

## Caching
Compiled binaries of installed crates are automatically cached. If a cached
version is present when the action is executed, it will be used. This allows
the installation of the crate to be almost instant in most cases.

Cached binaries will be automatically removed by GitHub if they have not been
accessed in the last 7 days. Read [Caching dependencies to speed up workflows]
to learn more about caching with GitHub Actions.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Cache key details</strong></summary>

  The `~/.cargo-install/<crate-name>` folder is cached with a cache key that
  follows the following pattern:

  ```
    ```

  The hash is derived from the action job and runner os name and the
  installation arguments. The `cache-key` value is added to the hashed string
  if provided.
</details>

## Security
Crates are installed using `cargo install` and the latest version is retrieved
with the [crates.io] API. You can ask to install a specific version by not
using any semver range operator.

If using a git repository, the action will use [`git ls-remote`] to retrieve
the commit hash. The repository is cloned by `cargo install`.

## Contributing
There is no particular contribution guidelines, feel free to open a new PR to
improve the code. If you want to introduce a new feature, please create an
issue before.

989,"# Utils action

This action calculates several handy fields/outputs to use in other jobs.

## Inputs

### `artifact_prefix`

**Optional** The prefix that `formatted_name` should start with.
By default there is no prefix. If a prefix is given, a trailing dash will be added if missing.
E.g. both `""test""` and `""test-""` will result in `formatted_name` starting with `""test-""`

### `artifact_extension`

**Optional** The extension that `formatted_name` should end with.
By default, there is no extension. Similar to `artifact_prefix`, a leading dot is automatically added.
E.g. both `""txt""` and `"".txt""` will result in `formatted_name` ending with `"".txt""`

### `append_sha`

**Optional** Whether to make sure the first 8 characters of the commit SHA are included in `formatted_name`.
This will make sure the `formatted_name` will end with e.g. `-ab1cd3ef`.
See the section about `formatted_name` on the specific logic of this.

## Outputs

### `formatted_name`

A nicely formatted name based on the `ref` and `sha` in the current workflow context.
_`ref` is for example `refs/tags/v1.0.0` when this workflow run is for pushing the `v1.0.0` tag, while `refs/heads/wip/stuff` would be for the  `wip/stuff` branch._
The algorithm looks more or less like this:

- Calculate the base name
  - If `ref` represents a semver tag _(starts with `vX.Y.Z` where X/Y/Z are numbers)_:
    => Use the tag name without the leading `v`, e.g. `1.0.0` for `v1.0.0`
  - If `ref` represents another tag, use the _(whole)_ tag name
  - If `ref` represents a branch, use the branch name, e.g. `wip/stuff`
  - If `ref` represents a pull request, use `pr-123` with the correct number
  - Any other `ref` should never be pushed, but if so:
    => If it starts with `refs/`, use everything after the `/`
  - Otherwise use the first 8 characters of the commit SHA
- Include commit SHA if `append_sha` is set
  - In case the base name already is the first 8 characters, do nothing
  - Otherwise, append e.g. `-ab1cd3ef` to the base name
- Convert all slashes (`/`) to dashes (`-`), e.g. `wip/stuff` becomes `wip-stuff`
- Remove all non-alphanumeric characters apart from dashes/dots/underscores

**Examples**:

- Pushing commit `ab1cd3ef...` to the branch `wip/stuff`:
  - With `append_sha` results in `wip-stuff-ab1cd3ef` otherwise `wip-stuff`
- Pushing commit `ab1cd3ef...` to pull request 123 or merging it:
  - With `append_sha` results in `pr-123-ab1cd3ef` otherwise `pr-123`
- Pushing tag `v1.2.3` pointing at commit `ab1cd3ef...`:
  - With `append_sha` results in `1.2.3-ab1cd3ef` otherwise `1.2.3`
- Pushing tag `verdict` pointing at commit `ab1cd3ef...`:
  - With `append_sha` results in `verdict-ab1cd3ef` otherwise `verdict`

### `artifact_name`

Basically appending everything together into `[artifact_prefix-]formatted_name[.artifact_extension]`.

Missing inputs won\'t be included. The prefix will have a trailing dash added if missing, while for the extension it\'s a leading dot.

Example for `formatted_name` being `master`:

- Without `artifact_prefix` and `artifact_extension`:
- With `artifact_prefix` set to `bundled` => `bundled-master`
- With `artifact_prefix` set to `bundled-` => `bundled-master`
- With `artifact_extension` set to `js` => `master.js`
- With `artifact_extension` set to `.js` => `master.js`
- With prefix/extension set to `bundled-`/`js` => `bundled-master.js`
- With prefix/extension set to `bundled`/`.js` => `bundled-master.js`

### `tag_version`

If this push is for a semver tag (e.g. `vX.Y.Z`), this will be set to `X.Y.Z`.

For example, pushing the tag `v1.2.3` results in `tag_version` being `1.2.3`.

### `pr_number`

If this push is towards a pull request, this will be set to its number.

## Example usage

```yml
```

Pushing commit `ab1cd3ef...` to the branch `master` would result in the workflow run having an artifact named `my-extension-master-ab1cd3ef.vsix`.

# Node.js LTS versions

Retrieve a list of [Long Term Stable](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) versions of Node.js.

The output of the yaml function is designed to populate a GitHub Actions matrix declaration so that your CI is always testing with every **Active LTS** version of Node.js.

### Usage

This action has three outputs:

- `active` is currently active node.js versions
- `lts` is a subset of active versions.
- `min` is the lowest LTS version

At the time of writing, active=`[14,16,18]` and lts=`[14,16]`. Node.js v18 is due to start LTS in five more months.

992,"# GitHub Action: Dependabot Auto Merge

Automatically merge Dependabot PRs when version comparison is within range.

[![license][license-img]][license-url]
[![release][release-img]][release-url]

> **Note:** *Dependabot will wait until all your status checks pass before merging. This is a function of Dependabot itself, and not this Action.*

## Usage

``` yaml
```

The action will only merge PRs whose checks (CI/CD) pass.

### Examples

Minimal setup:

``` yaml
```

Only merge if the changed dependency version is a `patch` *(default behavior)*:

``` yaml
```

Only merge if the changed dependency version is a `minor`:

``` yaml
```

Using a configuration file:

###### `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`

``` yaml
```

###### `.github/auto-merge.yml`

``` yaml
```

### Inputs

| input          | required | default                  | description                                         |
|----------------|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `github-token` | \xe2\x9c\x94        | `github.token`           | The GitHub token used to merge the pull-request     |
| `config`       | \xe2\x9c\x94        | `.github/auto-merge.yml` | Path to configuration file *(relative to root)*     |
| `target`       | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | `patch`                  | The version comparison target (major, minor, patch) |
| `command`      | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | `merge`                  | The command to pass to Dependabot                   |
| `botName`      | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | `dependabot`             | The bot to tag in approve/comment message.          |
| `approve`      | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | `true`                   | Auto-approve pull-requests                          |

### Token Scope

The GitHub token is a [Personal Access Token][] with the following scopes:

-   `repo` for private repositories
-   `public_repo` for public repositories

The token MUST be created from a user with **`push`** permission to the repository.

> \xe2\x84\xb9 *see reference for [user owned repos][] and for [org owned repos][]*

### Configuration file syntax

Using the configuration file *(specified with `config` input)*, you have the option to provide a more fine-grained configuration. The following example configuration file merges

-   minor updates for `aws-sdk`
-   minor development dependency updates
-   patch production dependency updates
-   minor security-critical production dependency updates

``` yaml
```

#### Match Properties

| property          | required | supported values                           |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `dependency_name` | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | full name of dependency, or a regex string |
| `dependency_type` | \xe2\x9d\x8c       | `all`, `production`, `development`         |
| `update_type`     | \xe2\x9c\x94        | `all`, `security:*`, `semver:*`            |

> **`update_type`** can specify security match or semver match with the syntax: `${type}:${match}`, e.g.
>
> -   **security:patch**  
>     SemVer patch update that fixes a known security vulnerability
>
> -   **semver:patch**  
>     SemVer patch update, e.g. \\> 1.x && 1.0.1 to 1.0.3
>
> -   **semver:minor**  
>     SemVer minor update, e.g. \\> 1.x && 2.1.4 to 2.3.1
>
> To allow `prereleases`, the corresponding `prepatch`, `preminor` and `premajor` types are also supported

###### Defaults

By default, if no configuration file is present in the repo, the action will assume the following:

``` yaml
```

> Where `$TARGET` is the `target` value from the action [Inputs][]

The syntax is based on the [legacy dependaBot v1 config format][].
However, **`in_range` is not supported yet**.

## Exceptions and Edge Cases

1.  Parsing of *version ranges* is not currently supported

<!-- -->

    Update stone requirement from ==1.* to ==3.*
    requirements: update sphinx-autodoc-typehints requirement from <=1.11.0 to <1.12.0
    Update rake requirement from ~> 10.4 to ~> 13.0

2.  Parsing of non semver numbering is not currently supported

<!-- -->

    Bump actions/cache from v2.0 to v2.1.2
    chore(deps): bump docker/build-push-action from v1 to v2

3.  Sometimes Dependabot does not include the ""from"" version, so version comparison logic is impossible:

<!-- -->

    Update actions/setup-python requirement to v2.1.4
    Update actions/cache requirement to v2.1.2

if your config is anything other than `update_type: all`, or `update_type: semver:all` the action will fallback to manual merge, since there is no way to compare version ranges for merging.

Custom Lighthouse config can be defined in a seperate Lighthouse config using
the [custom Lighthouse config syntax](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).
This is then referenced by the `lighthouserc` file in the `configPath`.

## Inputs

#### `urls`

Provide the list of URLs separated by a new line.
Each URL is audited using the latest version of Lighthouse and Chrome preinstalled on the environment.

```yml
````

#### `uploadArtifacts` (default: false)

Upload Lighthouse results as [action artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts) to persist results. Equivalent to using [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) to save the artifacts with additional action steps.

```yml
```

#### `temporaryPublicStorage` (default: false)

Upload reports to the [_temporary public storage_](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#collect-lighthouse-results).

> **Note**: As the name implies, this is temporary and public storage. If you\'re uncomfortable with the idea of your Lighthouse reports being stored
> on a public URL on Google Cloud, use a private [LHCI server](#serverBaseUrl). Reports are automatically deleted 7 days after upload.

```yml
```

#### `budgetPath`

Use a performance budget to keep your page size in check. `Lighthouse CI Action` will fail the build if one of the URLs exceeds the budget.

Learn more about the [budget.json spec](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/budget.json) and [practical use of performance budgets](https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets).

```yml
```

#### `runs` (default: 1)

Specify the number of runs to do on each URL.

> **Note**: Asserting against a single run can lead to flaky performance assertions.
> Use `1` only to ensure static audits like Lighthouse scores, page size, or performance budgets.

```yml
```

#### `configPath`

Set a path to a custom [lighthouserc file](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for full control of the Lighthouse environment and assertions.

Use `lighthouserc` to configure the collection of data (via Lighthouse config and Chrome Flags), and CI assertions (via LHCI assertions).

```yml
```

If some configurations aren\'t set using action parameters, the settings are fetched from the config file provided here.

#### `serverBaseUrl`

Upload Lighthouse results to a private [LHCI server](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) by specifying both `serverBaseUrl` and `serverToken`.
This will replace uploading to `temporary-public-storage`.

```yml
```

> **Note**: Use [Github secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) to keep your token hidden!

#### `basicAuthUsername` `basicAuthPassword`

Lighthouse servers can be protected with basic authentication [LHCI server basic authentication](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/server.md#basic-authentication) by specifying both `basicAuthUsername` and `basicAuthPassword` will authenticate the upload.

```yml
```

> **Note**: Use [Github secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) to keep your username and password hidden!

## Outputs

Use outputs to compose results of the LHCI Action with other Github Actions, like webhooks, notifications, or custom assertions.

### `resultsPath`

A path to `.lighthouseci` results folder:

```
```

### `links`

A JSON string with a links to uploaded results:

```js
```

### `assertionResults`

A JSON string with assertion results:

```js
```

### `manifest`

A JSON string with report results ([LHCI docs reference](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#outputdir)):

```json
```

995,"# Changeset Action
> Automate adding a changeset for simple pull requests

## About

This action works with the [changesets][changesetsUrl] versioning tool to allow
you to automate the creation of changesets typically for automated code creation
tools like [renovate][renovateUrl] or [dependabot][dependabotUrl] that keep your
dependencies up-to-date. You can also use it to manually add a changeset by
providing inputs without having to use the changesets CLI.

## Usage

[See the action being used in this repository][workflowUrl].

# About

Finds publicly known security vulnerabilities in a website\'s frontend JavaScript libraries.

# Usage

## Command line

Using Node.js\'s `npx` to run a one-off scan of a website:

```bash
```

The CLI will gracefully handle cases where the URL to scan is missing by prompting you to enter it:

```bash
```

### Exit codes

If the CLI detects an error, it will terminate with an exit code different from 0.

Exit Code 0: Everything is fine. No vulnerabilities found.

Exit Code 1: An error happened during the execution. Check the logs for details.

Exit Code 2: Vulnerabilities were found. Check the logs for details.

## Docker

To build and run the container locally:

```bash
```

`SCAN_URL` is an environment variable and its value must be replaced with the desired URL during Docker run. Docker container will exit once the scan has been completed.

If you wish to provide command line arguments to `is-website-vulnerable` and customize the run, such as providing `--json` or other supported arguments, you should omit the environment variable and provide the full command. Here is an example:

```
```

:warning: A modern version of Chrome is assumed to be available when using `is-website-vulnerable`. It may not be safe to assume that this is satisfied automatically on some CI services. For example, [additional configuration](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome#selecting-a-chrome-version) is necessary for [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).

# GitHub Action
Create .github/workflows/is-website-vulnerable.yml with the url that you want scanned:

```yaml
```

# Install

You can install globally via:

```bash
```

997,"# delete-deployment-environment

GitHub action that will find and delete all deployments by deployment name as well as the GitHub environment
they are deployed to.
It will first find and mark all deployments as `inactive` and then delete all deployments and then the environment.

If you want to only delete deployments and the not environment, add `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`.

If you want to keep deployments but inactivate all deployments, add `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true`

If you want to only delete a deployment ref and not all deployments of a given environment, add `ref: my-branch`

Note if you pass `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true` and `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`, `onlyRemoveDeployments` will override
`onlyDeactivateDeployments` and all deployments will be removed.

Also note that if you are planning on deleting a created environment, your `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have permissions with repo scope. The token provided by the workflow, `github.token` does not have the permissions to delete created environments. _(See [Delete an environment REST API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#delete-an-environment))_

If you see a `Resource not accessible by integration` error, you\'ll likely need to follow the instructions below to obtain the proper token.

### How to obtain the proper token

For certain operations _(like deleting an environment)_, your GitHub Action will need additional permissions that your `github.token` simply doesn\'t have.

In this case, a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps) can be created to assume the required permissions, and ultimately your own Actions will use a [Private Key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#generating-a-private-key) to later exchange for a JWT token, which this Action can use to execute operations.

1. [Create a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app).
2. [Generate a Private Key](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#generating-a-private-key)
3. Add your GitHub App\'s ""App ID"" to your repo\'s [Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) _(ex: `GH_APP_ID`)_
4. Add your Private Key to your repo\'s [Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) _(ex: `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`)_
5. Use [navikt/github-app-token-generator](https://github.com/navikt/github-app-token-generator) before using this action to generate a JWT

## Using the action

In this barebones example, we look to see if a pull_request pointing towards the `main` branch has a label \'preview\'.

``` YAML
```

#### Install
Click the button \'Use this workflow\', or if you\'re on the marketplace \'Use latest version.\'

## Configuration
**Failure to supply either a `contains` __or__ `exact` label will result in job failure.**

You can either loosely check for a label, or strictly check, but not both. If you need to check for more than one label try and narrow down your usecases for your labels first. If you still need more than one label for a job to trigger, stack HasLabel! The Action outputs unique variables through the [`step.output`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#operators) context. 
``` YAML
```

## `contains: $labelname`  
###### Type: String


If a label contains the string provided, HasLabel will proceed by outputting `labeled-$labelname`. Useful for statically worded labels such as `docs` or `feat` where you have flexibility in the naming scheme.

## `exact: $labelname`  
###### Type: String

If a label contains the string provided, HasLabel will proceed by outputting `labeled-$labelname`. Useful for statically worded labels such as `docs` or `feat` where you have flexability in the naming scheme.

# Events

HasLabel handles labeled, synchronize & unlabeled events by outputting unique variables accessable through `steps.<stepid>.outputs.<event>-<label>`. I\'d suggest learning more about the [steps context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#operators) so to best utilize this Action.

## `labeled`, `synchronize`  
###### Outputs: `labeled-$labelname` 
###### Usage: `steps.<stepid>.outputs.labeled-$labelname` 

Replace $labelname with the label name you specified.
If the supplied label is found, HasLabel will signify this by outputting a unique variable in the form of `labeled-$labelname`, perfect for custom logic.
This also goes for the unique `synchronize` event, allowing pull_request\'s dependent on push events on pull_requests


Example: A Step triggered when a pull_request has label `preview`.
``` YAML
```


## `unlabeled`  
###### Outputs: `unlabeled-$labelname` 
###### Usage: `steps.<stepid>.outputs.unlabeled-$labelname` 

Replace $labelname with the label name you specified.
If the supplied label is either not found or was just removed, HasLabel will signify this by outputting a unique variable in the form of `unlabeled-$labelname`. Especially useful if you want to trigger steps based on a loss of a label. Such as review checks, stagging builds or approvals.

Example: A Step triggered when a label is no-longer present.
``` YAML
```

# Real World
This is a good real-world example where you trigger @nwtgck\'s Netlify deploy action once the label `preview` is added.

You could just as easily have this action work in a single job too! Accessing the outputs of a step are easy to access through: `steps.<jobid>.outputs.<labeled/unlabeled>-<label>`

``` YAML
```

# match-tag-to-package-version

A github action that makes sure that git tag and version in package.json match

# Usage

You can safeguard that your package.json and your git tag matches using this action and proceed to release after the check successfully ran.

```yaml
```

The action outputs package.json version as `PACKAGE_VERSION` and the tag (without \'refs/tags/\') as `TAG_VERSION`.  
Eg. use it as `steps.match-tag-to-package-version.outputs.PACKAGE_VERSION` in other steps.

1007,"# setup-homeassistant

_Setup a Home Assistant instance in your GitHub action flow._

This can be usefull for any number of reasons, but espesially for testing where you need to test against a running installation of Home Assistant.

During the run it will validate the configuration, and create a LLAT that can be used for authentication.

## Usage

```yaml
```

When this step is complete you will have access to these variables you can use later in your job.

variable | description
-- | --
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.url }}` | This is the URL to reach the instance.
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.token }}` | This is a LLAT you can use for autenticated requests.
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.containername }}` | This is the name of the container that is running, can be usefull if you need to query the logs.

## Inputs

Inputs for actions are defined with the `with:` key for the stage configuration, these inputs are valid:

input | description
-- | --
`tag` | This can be any valid tag for a `homeassistant/home-assistant` container, the default is `dev`.
`config-dir` | Relative path to the configuration directory you want to use, defaults to the root of the repo.
`retry-limit` | How many times/seconds the action will wait for Home Assistant to start before giving up, `360` is the default.

## Full usage example


```yaml
```

## Versions

To use a specific version of this action instead of `main` set the value after `@` in the `uses` definition, like:

```yaml
```

If you do this, please enable [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/github-actions/) to help you keep that up to date.

# Triage Action
This action will manage triage state in issues.

## Setting up
Create a file named `.github/workflows/triage.yml`.

### Minimal Configuration
```yml
```

### Complete configuration
All values are default.
```yml
```

### Auto update
You can use (at your own risk) the `release` branch instead of the specific version tag.  
Never user `master`, since the distribution file does not exist in this branch and the action will always fail.

## Disclaimer
The GitHub Projects API is currently in beta. This means that it can have a breaking change anytime, which may break this action and it might not be fixed.

![functions of bump-everywhere](./img/functions.png)

## Features

\xf0\x9f\xa4\x96 Allows you to automatically:

- Bump your semantic git tag by increasing the patch version.
- Create & commit a changelog file.
- If `npm` project then bump `package.json` version and commit.
- Check `README.md` file, if it has references to older version, update with never version.
- Create a release on GitHub with auto-generated release notes.

\xe2\x9c\x85 Other features include:

- Zero-configuration for most use-cases, but can still be customized.
- It supports safe re-runs, it means that if you can run it for an already bumped or tagged repository, it\'ll not increase the version as everything is still up-to-date. It protects against recursive runs.

## Usage

### Option 1. Use GitHub actions

```yaml
```

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

### Option 2. Use Docker

- To get the image you can either:
  - Pull from docker hub using `docker pull undergroundwires/bump-everywhere:latest`
  - Or build image yourself using `docker build . --tag undergroundwires/bump-everywhere:latest`
- Run with arguments:

  ```sh
    args=(
      # Required:
      --repository ""undergroundwires/privacy.sexy""
      --user ""bot-user""
      --git-token ""GitHub PAT for pushes""
      --release-type ""prerelease""
      --release-token ""GitHub PAT for releases""
      --commit-message ""\xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f bump to {{version}}""
      # Optional:
      --branch \'custom branch name\'
    )
    docker run undergroundwires/bump-everywhere ""${args[@]}""
  ```

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

### Option 3. Use `npm`

1. (Optionally) install globally: `npm install -g bump-everywhere`
   - or locally: `npm install bump-every-where --save-dev`
2. Run `npx bump-everywhere <parameters...>`
   - See [docker example](#option-2-use-docker) for parameter usage

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

### Option 4. Use scripts

1. Ensure `bash` (4 or newer), `git`, `curl`, `jq` exists in your environment
   - On Alpine: `apk add bash git curl jq`
   - On Windows: `choco install git curl jq` and use Git Bash
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/undergroundwires/bump-everywhere`
   - or optionally add this repository as git submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/undergroundwires/bump-everywhere`
3. Call the script: `bash ""scripts/bump-everywhere.sh"" <parameters>`
   - See [docker example](#option-2-use-docker) for parameter usage

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

## Updating minor & major versions

bump-everywhere only increases your patch versions. You manually tag your last commit to update major & minor versions.

E.g. :

```sh
```

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

## All scripts

You can also use following scripts individually (check script files for usage, prerequisites & dependencies):

- **[bump-and-tag-version.sh](./scripts/bump-and-tag-version.sh)**: Automate versioning.
- **[create-github-release.sh](./scripts/create-github-release.sh)**: Automate creating GitHub releases
- **[print-changelog.sh](./scripts/print-changelog.sh)**: Automate creation of changelogs, e.g. `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **[configure-github-repo.sh](./scripts/configure-github-repo.sh)**: Set-up CI/CD user for current repository.
- **[log-commits.sh](./scripts/shared/log-commits.sh)**: Filters & logs commits as bullet points in markdown form.
- **[bump-npm-version.sh](./scripts/bump-npm-version.sh)**: Updates `packages.json` to match the latest version.
- **[bump-readme-versions.sh](./scripts/bump-readme-versions.sh)**: Updates old references to `README.md` to the latest version.

[\xe2\x86\x91](#bump-everywhere)

## Some example usages

- [bump-everywhere](https://github.com/undergroundwires/bump-everywhere#gitops): Repository itself is automatically versioned & released using its own action

1015,"# browserslist-update-action

A GitHub Action that runs `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` on a repository and proposes a pull request to merge updates.

## v2 vs v1

`v1` uses command `npx browserslist@latest --update-db` which is now deprecated and to be removed in a future major `browserslist` release. It should be dropped in favor of `v2` which uses new command `npx update-browserslist-db@latest`.

:warning: v2 requires at least Node 15 (`npm` 6). Stick to `v1` otherwise.

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Action inputs

Inputs with defaults are **optional**.

## Contributing

### Edit / add GraphQL queries and mutations

`src/generated` folder contains generated type definitions based on queries. Run `npm run graphql` to update.

### Release a version

```sh
```

Or shortly

```sh
```

Then bump version number in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Push commits.

Keep a major version tag synchronized with updates, e.g. if you publish version `v2.0.3`, then a `v2` branch should be positioned at the same location.

1017,"# github-action-notify-release

GitHub Action that automatically creates an issue with an overview of the commits that are waiting to be released. After a new release is published, the issue will be automatically closed.

## Permissions

This action requires the following permissions:
  - `issues: write`
  - `contents: read`

\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 `contents:read` is required because the action is using a `actions/checkout@v3` action to download the repository content.

## Usage

Configure this action in your workflows providing the inputs described below in order to get notified in `x` time after the repo has been updated but no release has happened.

It is possible to snooze the notification issue for `x` time by closing it as **not planned**. Once the time has passed a new issue will be created.

## Inputs

| inputs                   | required | default               | description |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `github-token`           | no       | `${{ github.token }}` | A github token. |
| `notify-after`           | no       |                       | The time after which unreleased commits should be considered stale and should notify for a release.<br />This option accepts various time formats as described by the time conversion library [ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms). |
| `stale-days`             | no       | `7`                   | \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f **Deprecated** \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Number of days of inactivity before a release becomes stale. The value can be a number or a string. |
| `commit-messages-lines`  | no       | `1`                   | Limit the number of first `x` lines from commit messages that will be added in the issue description. No truncation when set to `0`. |

1019,"# Auto Release Draft

A GitHub action that automatically drafts a GitHub release based on a newly created version tag.

The commit messages between the created version tag and the one that came before it will become the release notes.

Here's an example. Let's assume the history of your repository looks like this:

```
```

Here, `v2` is the last created version tag. When `auto-release-draft` runs, it will draft a release with the commit messages for `C` and `D` as the release notes.

If the created version tag is the first one in the repository, then all commit messages from the beginning of the repository's history will be included in the release notes:

```
```

In this case, the release notes will contain the messages for `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`.

A version tag is an [annotated tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#_annotated_tags) whose name starts with the prefix `v` followed by one or more characters. This means `v1`, `v.1`, `v1.0.0` and `v1.0.0-beta1` are all valid version tags. If you don't know which versioning scheme to adopt for your project, [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) is a very good choice.

## Inputs

### `repo-token`

**(Required)** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` used to access the current repository from the GitHub REST API.

## Outputs

### `release-url`

The URL of the GitHub release that was drafted. Defaults to an empty string.

## Usage

Here's an example of a workflow that listens for the `create` event and automatically creates a release draft with the commit messages as release notes. It also prints the URL of the release page to the build log.

```yaml
```

Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos. Gitleaks is an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution for detecting secrets, past or present, in your code. Enable **Gitleaks-Action** in your GitHub workflows to be alerted when secrets are leaked as soon as they happen. Check out our demos [here (.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15034943/178513034-de5a1906-b71d-454a-a792-47b7ac0e21e6.gif) and [here (.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15034943/193462170-7314a63b-1c37-4c9e-ac93-33d6d3fc561a.png), or see what\'s new in v2 [here](v2.md). Don\'t forget to check out our [blog](https://blog.gitleaks.io), which details how to configure and set up Gitleaks-Action for organizations and enterprises.

## Usage Example

```yml
```


---
### Environment Variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This variable is automatically assigned by GitHub when any action gets kicked off. You can read more about the token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret).
  **gitleaks-action** uses this token to call [a GitHub API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18#pulls-create-review-comment) to comment on PRs.
- `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` (required for organizations, not required for user accounts): A **gitleaks-action** license can be obtained at [gitleaks.io](https://gitleaks.io/products.html). **It should be added as an encrypted secret [to the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) or [to the organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-organization).**
- `GITLEAKS_NOTIFY_USER_LIST` (optional): A list of GitHub accounts that should be alerted when **gitleaks-action** detects a leak. An email will be sent by GitHub to the user if their GitHub notification settings permit it. The format should be comma-separated with each username prefixed with `@`. Ex: `@octocat,@zricethezav,@gitleaks`. Spaces are okay too.
- `GITLEAKS_ENABLE_COMMENTS` (optional): Boolean value that turns on or off PR commenting. Default value is `true`.
  Set to `false` to disable comments.
- `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` (optional): Path to a [gitleaks configuration file](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#configuration).
- `GITLEAKS_ENABLE_UPLOAD_ARTIFACT` (optional): Boolean value that turns on or off uploading a sarif artifact when gitleaks detects secrets. Defaults to `true`.
- `GITLEAKS_ENABLE_SUMMARY` (optional): Boolean value to enable or disable gitleaks job summary. Defaults to `true`.

## Questions

### Do I need a _free_ license key?
If you are scanning repos that belong to [an organization account](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations), you will need to obtain a [free license key](https://gitleaks.io/products.html)

If you are scanning repos that belong to [a personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-accounts), then no license key is required.

### How do I get a _free_ license key?

You can visit [gitleaks.io](https://gitleaks.io/products.html) to sign up for a
free license key. Clicking ""Sign Up"" will take you to a google form where you will need to supply name, email, and company. An email with a license key will show up shortly after submission.

### Can I use a custom gitleaks configuration?

You can! This GitHub Action follows a similar order of precedence
as the gitleaks CLI tool. You can use `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` to explicitly set a
config path _or_ create a `gitleaks.toml` at the root of the repo which will be
automatically detected and used by **gitleaks-action**.

### Does this GitHub Action send any data to 3rd parties?

The only data that **gitleaks-action** sends to any third party is data related to license key validation (namely `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`, [repo name](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks-action/blob/v2/src/keygen.js#L76), and [repo owner](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks-action/blob/v2/src/keygen.js#L18)), which is sent to the license key validation service, [keygen](https://keygen.sh). Your code never leaves GitHub because the scanning takes place within the GitHub Actions docker container.

### Can I use **gitleaks-action** as a third-party tool for [GitHub code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository)?

You _can_ but it is not recommended because it gives a false sense of security. If a secret is leaked in one commit, then removed in a subsequent commit,
the security alert in the GitHub Security dashboard will show as resolved, even though the secret is still visible in the commit history. To truly address the leak,
you should rotate the secret (and also consider re-writing the git history to remove the leak altogether).

### Why is my gitleaks-action job suddenly failing?
_6/21/2022_

On June 21, 2022, we merged [Gitleaks Action v2](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action/releases/tag/v2.0.0) into the `master` branch. This was a breaking update, and we made an effort to contact as many of our users as possible via GitHub, social media, etc. If you didn\'t know this breaking update was coming, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. The good news is, remedying the job failure is straightforward! You can either:
1. [Upgrade to v2](v2.md#how-to-upgrade-to-v2), or
1. [Pin to an older version](v2.md#how-to-pin-to-v160)

Please note that if you are scanning repos that belong to an organization, you\'ll have to [acquire a GITLEAKS_LICENSE](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks-action#environment-variables) to use v2 (free ""Trial"" license available). That might come as a surprise to my users that are accustomed to using Gitleaks-Action free of charge, so I wrote a blog post explaining how/why I decided to monetize this project: https://blog.gitleaks.io/gitleaks-llc-announcement-d7d06a52e801

Finally, please see above for a summary of why I think you\'ll love the new v2 release: [v2 Benefits](v2.md#v2-benefits)

### How can I get a gitleaks badge on my readme?

Enable this **gitleaks-action** and copy
`<img alt=""gitleaks badge"" src=""https://img.shields.io/badge/protected%20by-gitleaks-blue"">` to your readme.

1026,"# Wait for Vercel Preview \xe2\x80\x94 A GitHub Action \xe2\x8f\xb1

Do you have other Github actions (Lighthouse, Cypress, etc) that depend on the Vercel Preview URL? This action will wait until the url is available before running the next task.

Please note that this action is supposed to be run on the `pull_request` or `push` events.

## Inputs

### `token` (Required)

The github secret `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

### `environment`

Optional \xe2\x80\x94 The name of the environment that was deployed to (e.g., staging or production)

### `max_timeout`

Optional \xe2\x80\x94 The amount of time to spend waiting on Vercel. Defaults to `60` seconds

### `allow_inactive`

Optional - Use the most recent inactive deployment (previously deployed preview) associated with the pull request if
no new deployment is available. Defaults to `false`.

### `check_interval`

Optional - How often (in seconds) should we make the HTTP request checking to see if the deployment is available? Defaults to `2` seconds.

### `vercel_password`

Optional - The [password](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#password-protection) for the deployment

### `path`

Optional - The URL that tests should run against (eg. `path: ""https://vercel.com""`).

## Outputs

### `url`

The vercel deploy preview url that was deployed.

### `vercel_jwt`

If accessing a password protected site, the JWT from the login event. This can be passed on to e2e tests, for instance.

## Example usage

Basic Usage

```yaml

[![Test Workflow Status](https://github.com/flood-io/is-published-on-npm/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flood-io/is-published-on-npm/actions)

This GitHub Action checks if a repositories package version as defined in `package.json` is published on NPM and sets outputs accordingly.

Check the example to see how this could be helpful to automating your release workflow.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Your workflow job must first checkout your repository and setup node before using this action, for example:

```yml
```

### Inputs

- `dir`: The directory containing the `package.json` to check is published. Default: `./`.

### Outputs

- `published`: `'true'` if the package with `name` and `version` as defined in `package.json` is published, `'false'` if it isn't. **Note**: This value is, as are all GitHub Action outputs, a **string**.
- `version`: The `version` as defined in `package.json`.

### Example workflow - Publish a new version if not published on NPM

On every `push` to branch `master`, publish the package to NPM if it isn't already published.

```yml
```

### Example workflow - Create a GitHub Release if not published on NPM

On every `push` to branch `master`, create a new GitHub release if it isn't already published to NPM.

```yml
```

[![CI](https://github.com/ethomson/issue-dashboard/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ethomson/issue-dashboard/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

**issue-dashboard** is a framework for creating dashboards from user data on GitHub, utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  You can collect data out of GitHub using issue queries or arbitrary JavaScript that you define, and this tool will generate dashboards in HTML or Markdown.

## Overview

A dashboard contains _widgets_ that contain data about your project:

**String widgets** display a string.

![Strings](documentation/example-strings.png)

**Number widgets** display numeric values in a compact form.

![Numbers](documentation/example-numbers.png)

**Graph widgets** display a bar chart.

![Graph](documentation/example-graph.png)

**Table widgets** display multiple rows in tabular form.

![Table](documentation/example-table.png)

For more information about widgets, see the [documentation](documentation#overview).

## Installation

This dashboard tool is an _action_ meant to be used in a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow.  You should provide your input in your workflow, and it will produce HTML or Markdown.  You can then either upload the result to GitHub Pages, or update an issue or file in the repository.

For example, a _step_ in a GitHub Actions workflow to run this action:

```yaml
```

For more information about installation, see the [documentation](documentation#installation).

## Example Configuration

* **[Static values](https://github.com/ethomson/issue-dashboard/blob/main/examples/static-values.yml)** ([Rendered output](https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/examples/static-values.html))
  The simplest way to configure a dashboard is using static values.  This may be useful to provide a rendered dashboard to existing data, which can be exported as YAML or JSON configuration.

* **[GitHub issue and pull request queries](https://github.com/ethomson/issue-dashboard/blob/main/examples/issue-queries.yml)** ([Rendered output](https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/examples/issue-queries.html))
  Dashboards can query GitHub issue and pull request data easily, by providing the query string.  Either the number of matching results will be displayed (for numeric values) or the actual results of the query will be shown (for tables).  Helpful date and time manipulation functions are included.

* **[JavaScript expressions](https://github.com/ethomson/issue-dashboard/blob/main/examples/javascript-expressions.yml)** ([Rendered output](https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/examples/javascript-expressions.html))
  Dashboards can execute JavaScript expressions to provide the values for widgets.

For more information about configuration, see the [documentation](documentation#configuration).

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/documentation/](https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/documentation/).

## Limitations

Currently, this tool only supports instantaneous data -- for example: how many issues with a certain label are open _right now_, or how many pull requests are currently open that were created within the last week.  It does not support time series, meaning you cannot plot a graph of the number of open issues per day.

## Notes

Heads up! Currently, there is a GitHub Actions limitation where events fired _inside_ an action will not trigger further workflows. If you use this action in your workflow, it will **not trigger** any ""Deployment"" workflows. Thanks to @rclayton-the-terrible for finding a workaround for this:

> While not ideal, if you use a token that is not the Action\'s GITHUB_TOKEN, this will work. I define a secret called GITHUB_DEPLOY_TOKEN and use that for API calls.

A workaround for this is to create the Deployment, perform the deployment steps, and then trigger an action to create a Deployment Status using my other action: [bloodf/github-deploy-status](https://github.com/bloodf/github-deploy-status).

For example:

```yaml
```
","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

1034,"# Matrix Message github action

This is a simple github action to send messages to matrix servers.

## Usage

Sending messages requires generating of an access token, which can be done with
`curl`, and is detailed [here](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server-api/).

The Room ID does not refer to the room\'s name, but its unique ID. In Riot, this
can be found by navigating to \'Room Settings\' -> \'Advanced\'.

Markdown-formatted messages are supported.

Publish Docker Action builds, creates tags and pushes docker image to your docker registry.

## Usage

This simple example uses `Dockerfile` in your workspace to build image, attach the `latest`
tag and push to docker default registry (docker.io). Repository name is your GitHub repository
name by default.

```yaml
```

Use `file` and `path` arguments to set docker build file or build context if they are not in the default workspace.

### Set up registry and repository name

You can set docker registry with `registry` argument. Change docker repository name with `repository` argument.
For example:

```yaml
    registry: docker.pkg.github.com
    repository: jerray/publish-docker-action
```

This will build and push the tag `docker.pkg.github.com/jerray/publish-docker-action:latest`.

### Tags

#### Static Tag List

You can use static tag list by providing `tags` argument. Concat multiple tag names with commas.

```yaml
    registry: docker.pkg.github.com
    repository: jerray/publish-docker-action
    tags: latest,newest,master
```

This example builds the image, creates three tags, and pushes all of them to the registry.

* `docker.pkg.github.com/jerray/publish-docker-action:latest`
* `docker.pkg.github.com/jerray/publish-docker-action:newest`
* `docker.pkg.github.com/jerray/publish-docker-action:master`

#### Auto Tag

Set `with.auto_tag: true` to allow action generate docker image tags automatically.

```yaml
    registry: docker.pkg.github.com
    repository: jerray/publish-docker-action
    auto_tag: true
```

Generated tags vary with `refs` types:

* branch: uses the branch name as docker tag name (`master` branch is renamed to `latest`).
* pull request: attaches a `pr-` prefix to branch name asdocker image tag. To allow pull request build, you must set `with.allow_pull_request` to `true`.
* tag: checks if the tag name is valid semantic version format (prefix `v` is allowed). If not, it uses git tag name as docker image tag directly. Else it generates three tags based on the version number, each followed with pre-release information.

Examples:

| Git | Docker Tag |
| --- | --- |
| branch `master` | `latest` |
| branch  `2019/09/28-new-feature` | `2019-09-28-new-feature` (`/` is replaced to `-`) |
| pull request `master` | `pr-master` |
| tag `1.0.0` | `1`, `1.0`, `1.0.0` |
| tag `v1.0.0` | `1`, `1.0`, `1.0.0` |
| tag `v1.0.0-rc1` | `1-rc1`, `1.0-rc1`, `1.0.0-rc1` |
| tag `20190921-actions` | `20190921-actions` (not semantic version) |

Auto tagging will override `with.tags` list.

Additionally, there's an output value `tag` you can use [in your next steps](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#steps-context).

```yaml
```

### Cache

Provide `with.cache` argument to build from cache.

### Build Args

Use `with.build_args` to provide docker build-time variables. Multiple variables must be separated by comma. 

```yaml
    registry: docker.pkg.github.com
    repository: jerray/publish-docker-action
    build_args: HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1,USER=nginx
```

### Target for Multi-Stage Builds

Provide `with.target` argument to set `--target` flag for docker build.

## Note

Please use the latest released version rather than master.

1040,"# CHANGELOG.md generator CLI and Github Action

Keeping [`CAHNGELOG.md`](https://github.com/AlexxNB/chalogen/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file in your repository is very important to inform users what happened in your code from version to version. Doing it manually is hard work, but using **Chalogen** you will get pretty changelog based on your commits. 

* Parse [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
* Supports version commits like from `npm version` command.
* Available as CLI tool or GitHub Action
* Supports tags named in [semver](https://semver.org) format
* Supports Git emojis

## Conventional commits

**Chalogen** will parse all your commits, but better result will be with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). If work with VSCode, there is [nice extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) to help you making such commits. If commits doesn't matched as conventional, it is just goes to `other` type group.

## CLI 

Install globaly with:
```sh
```

Then run in your local repositroy folder:
```sh
```
And you will see new CHANGELOG.md file with versions history.

> It is important to have full commits history in your local repository. 

Look for additional parameters with `chalogen --help` command.


## GitHub Action

It is good idea to run **Chalogen** in GitHub Action to have always actual changelog file in your repository. Just add and commit file `.github/workflows/generate_changelog.yml` in your GitHub repository:

> If you installed CLI you can just run `chalogen action` to put exactly same file in your current repo.

```yml
```

A [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) that will export [Figma](https://figma.com/) components from design files to your repository.

## Usage

**Example workflow**

```workflow
```

### Variables

**Secrets**

`FIGMA_TOKEN` **(required)**

This token is used to access the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#access-tokens). It\'s required to generate one so this action will work. It\'s recommended to set the token in a [secret token](https://help.github.com/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) in your repository.

**env variables**

`FIGMA_FILE_URL` **(required)**

This is the file url that you would like to export from. The action will search the file for [components](https://help.figma.com/article/66-components) and export them with your configurations.

**Workflow args (optional)**

* `format` \xe2\x80\x93 The export format for exporting from Figma. Options are `svg`, `jpg`, `png`. Default is `jpg`
* `outputDir` \xe2\x80\x93 Where you would like the exported files to live. Default is `./build/`
* `scale` \xe2\x80\x93 When choosing an image format `jpg` or `png` this is the export scale between `0.01` and `4` that will allow you to scale the image. Default is `1`.

### Output

The output of this action lives in `./build/` by default, but can be configured. In addition to the files exported you will see a `data.json` file exported. This contains information about the exported components mapped by component `id`.

The directory will look like this:

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x8b Common issues

### The action fails on the Dependabot pull requests

Due to the security reasons from March 1st, 2021 workflow runs that are triggered by Dependabot have permissions reduced by default: 

* [GitHub Actions: Workflows triggered by Dependabot PRs will run with read-only permissions](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/)

To ensure that sufficient permissions for this action are always granted, you will need to add `permissions` entry to the job which runs `yarn-lock-changes`:

```yml
```

### The action fails in a private repository

After one of the GitHub Actions security breaches GitHub decided to trim down the default permission set for actions running in private repositories. 

If you are trying to run action with default setup in the private repository, you will see the following error during `checkout` step:

```sh
```

This means that you will need to add the following `permissions` entry to the job which runs `checkout`:

```yml
```

If you would like to learn a little bit more about this problem, you can visit this issue in the GitHub Checkout Action repository: 
* https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/254

## \xf0\x9f\x94\x8d\xef\xb8\x8f Debugging

To run action in the debug mode you need to add the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` repository secret and set it to `true`, as stated in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging#enabling-step-debug-logging).

Then additional information which might be useful for the users when debugging the issues will be available in the action output, prefixed by `##[debug]`.

1051,"![Build Status](https://github.com/cardinalby/google-api-fetch-token-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)

# The purpose 

The action fetches an access token from Google API. 

It can be used to **prevent your Refresh Token from being expired**.

According to [Google\'s guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration), 
the refresh token might stop working if it has not been used for six months.

If you use it in your workflow running less often than 6 months, you can face the problem. 
[Schedule](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) 
this action to periodically access Google API and fetch access token to avoid that.

Based on [typed-chrome-webstore-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typed-chrome-webstore-api) package.

## About Google API access
To setup API access you need to specify `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `refreshToken` inputs.
To find out how to obtain them you can read:
* [Using the Chrome Web Store Publish API](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/using_webstore_api) 
* [How to generate Google API keys](https://github.com/DrewML/chrome-webstore-upload/blob/master/How%20to%20generate%20Google%20API%20keys.md)

## Inputs

* `clientId` **Required**
* `clientSecret` **Required**
* `refreshToken` **Required**

Don\'t forget to store these values in secrets!

## Outputs
* `accessToken` fetched access token

## Usage example
Create a separate workflow with a scheduled job:
```yaml
```

[![ISSUES](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/yinlinchen/amplify-preview-actions)](https://github.com/yinlinchen/amplify-preview-actions/issues)

AWS Amplify Pull-Request Previews currently only supports private GitHub repository. This `amplify-preview-actions` GitHub action enables the ability to deploy AWS Amplify Pull-Request Previews for your open source and public GitHub repository.

With this `amplify-preview-actions` GitHub action, you can define your own rule to deploy the Pull-Request branch to the AWS Amplify console app page for a preview. For example, you can setup a rule only a pull request is labeled with `Ready for review` and is assigned to a reviewer; and clean up the previews after the pull request is merged or closed.

## Getting Started
You can include the action in your workflow as `actions/amplify-preview-actions@master`.

### Basic ```workflow.yml``` Example
Deploy a PR preview branch to the Amplify console App page (not the Previews page) after a reviewer is assigned.

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```yaml
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise, they\'ll be public to anyone browsing your repository\'s source code and CI logs.

## Inputs

### amplify_command

**type**: `string`  
**values**: `deploy | delete`

#### deploy
Creates a new branch for an Amplify app using `BackendEnvARN` or `NewBackendEnvARN` and deploy your PR to the Amplify console app page (not the Previews page).

#### delete
Deletes a branch for an Amplify app.

## Advanced Examples
Note: All scenarios are assume that the PR is labeled with ```Ready for review``` and a reviewer is assigned.

### Scenario 1:
* A developer submits a PR for review using the existing backend environment. A new PR review branch is deployed to the Amplify console app page (not the Previews page) [Scenario 1](examples.md#scenario-1)

### Scenario 2:
* A developer submits a PR for review using a new backend environment. A new PR review branch using a new backend environment is deployed to the Amplify console app page (not the Previews page) [Scenario 2](examples.md#scenario-2)

### Scenario 3:
* A reviewer finish reviews a PR, approves it, and merges it into the codebase. The PR preview branch is deleted from the Amplify console app page.

or

* A reviewer finish reviews a PR, does not approve it and the developer closes the PR. The PR preview branch is deleted from the Amplify console app page. [Scenario 3](examples.md#scenario-3)

# pr-helper

Extremely powerful [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to streamline management of PRs through automation of common tasks. Very versatile with plenty of configuration settings to adapt to many different implementations.

Currently supports the following functionality:

- Welcome message on new PR
- Automatic Label assignment and removal
  - Based on Review criteria (required/provided)
  - If PRs qualify for automatic merge
- PR Comment automation
  - Welcome message with instructions on new PRs
  - Assign a label indicating if the PR is ready or on hold based on key words
- Pull Request Reviewers
  - Automatically assign reviewers from YAML front matter
  - Name matching to github username via Jekyll or DocFX Author/People YAML file. More details [here](./docs/FrontMatter.md).
- Pull Request Merge
  - Automatically merge when criteria is met
  - Respect requested reviews (_i.e. CODEOWNERS_)
  - Respect a minimal review count (_for now configured by input param, repo setting on roadmap_)
  - Delete branch (head ref) on merge

## Events

The Action can respond to the following [workflow events](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows):

- pull_request
- pull_request_review
- issue_comment
- schedule

## Inputs

Set the following inputs in the workflow file

### `repo-token`

**Required** The token to use for github authentication. Recommend using `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. If additional access is required use a PAT/Secret and set it as a secret. More info see [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token).

> If you have enabled Branch Protection rules then a PAT/Secret will need to be configured.

### `enable-prmerge-automation`

**Required** Set to true to enable the auto merge capabilities

### `enable-prcomment-automation`

**Required** Set to true to enable the PR/Issue comment automation

### `enable-prlabel-automation`

**Required** Set to true to enable the PR label automation

### `enable-prreviewer-frontmatter`

Set to true to enable reviewers to be set from owner in YAML front matter.

### `enable-welcomemessage`

**Required** Set to true to automatically send a welcome message to new contributors

### `welcome-message`

The custom welcome message to send to new contributors

Requires `enable-welcomemessage: true`

### `prmerge-requireallchecks`

Set to true if all checks need to complete before auto merging

### `prmerge-requirereviewcount`

Should match the setting in your GitHub repo. Set it to -1 to disable.

### `prmerge-method`

The method to use when merging the PRs

### `prmerge-pathcheck`

Set to true to require a path check for auto merge capabilities

Requires `enable-prmerge-automation: true`

### `prmerge-allowpaths`

Provide the path globs which will allow auto merge. JSON object as string, example format {""any"":[""docs/**""]}.

Requires `prmerge-pathcheck: true`

### `prmerge-deletebranch`

If true then the branch will be deleted on merge

Requires `enable-prmerge-automation: true`

### `prmerge-deletebranch-config`

Provide the branch patterns which will allow/deny auto delete on merge. JSON object as string, example format {""deny"":[""dev""]}.

Requires `prmerge-deletebranch: true`

### `prreviewer-authorkey`

The key in the YAML front matter to define the article author(s), who will be assigned as reviewers. Defaults to `author`

```yml
```

Requires `enable-prreviewer-frontmatter: true`

### `prreviewer-githubuserfromauthorfile`

When set to `true` enables the lookup of the author from the Jekyll style Author YAML file

Requires `enable-prreviewer-frontmatter: true`

### `prreviewer-authorfilepath`

Provides the ability to configure the path to the Jekyll authors YAML file to use in lookup. Default is `docs/_data/authors.yml`

Requires `enable-prreviewer-frontmatter: true` and `prreviewer-githubuserfromauthorfile: true`

### `prreviewer-bypassforfileowner`

Provides the ability to by pass review checks when all the changed files are owned by the author of the PR.
If you configure [Branch Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) within GitHub security, then it may block this setting from working. Configuring the `prmerge-requirereviewcount` setting in it\'s place will not affect this setting.

Requires `enable-prreviewer-frontmatter: true`

### `prlabel-default`

The initial label to set on PRs when first created

### `prlabel-ready`

The label to use when the PR has been signed off and ready for merge

### `prlabel-onhold`

The label to use when the PR is on hold

### `prlabel-reviewrequired`

The label to use when the PR requires reviews

### `prlabel-automerge`

The label to set on PRs when it qualifies for automatic merge by this action

## Outputs

None

## Example usage

Create the following file within your repo as `.github/workflows/pullrequest.yml` to configure an action.

```yml
```

> Note: The `uses` syntax includes tag/branch specification. For the latest release see [tags](https://github.com/Matticusau/pr-helper/tags).

To restrict the branches that this workflow executes on use this syntax

```yml
```

## Example inputs

The action can be customized using the additional inputs on the workflow yaml file. This will always be read from the default branch of the repository, rather than custom yaml config files which can be overridden as they are read in the branch where the workflow is triggered from.

```yml
```

## Suggested Label Colors

Labels will be created during the assignment if they do not exist. The following are suggested labels and colors:

| Label | Description | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pr-onhold | Pull Request is not yet ready to process automatically or review | #b60205 (red) |
| review-required | Pull Request or Issue requires review | #fbca04 (yellow) |
| qualifies-auto-merge | Pull Request qualifies for automatic merge | #0e8a16 (green) |
| pr-ready | Pull Request is ready to process or review | #0e8a16 (green) |

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues running the action enable the debug logs as some additional logging has been built into the Action.

1. To enable runner diagnostic logging, set the following secret in the repository that contains the workflow: `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to `true`.
1. To download runner diagnostic logs, download the log archive of the workflow run. The runner diagnostic logs are contained in the `runner-diagnostic-logs` folder. For more information on downloading logs, see [Downloading logs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#downloading-logs).

[Enable debug logging](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-debug-logging)

## Known issues

### PRs from Forked private repo [#24](https://github.com/Matticusau/pr-helper/issues/24)

From [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories)

> Note: Workflows do not run on private base repositories when you open a pull request from a forked repository.

To work around this use the schedule event. This action supports the schedule event for Label, Review, and Merge features. Currently the Welcome message functionality is only supported for pull_request events.

Example YAML for running the action every day at 1am.

```yml
```

### Multiple files and CODEOWNERS will block auto merge [#27](https://github.com/Matticusau/pr-helper/issues/27)

When using the CODEOWNERS feature and multiple files with different CODEOWNERS are modified. Even though you meet the minimum number of reviewers if there is still pending reviews from CODEOWNERS for files with no review yet, then this will block the merge and may throw an error on the action workflow.

A GitHub Action that performs static analysis for shell scripts using [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

![](docs/images/preview.png)

<br>

# Usage

Shell Linter can perform static analysis in various ways. By default it scans all the ShellCheck-supported shell scripts (sh/bash/dash/ksh) in your project. However, you can use the `path` parameter to scan a specific file or folder or use the `exclude-paths` parameter to exclude files or folders from the scan. With Shell Linter, you can also specify the minimum severity of errors to consider using the `severity` parameter. Specific use cases along with examples are shown below:

#### Run static analysis for all the supported shell scripts in your repository:
```yml
```

#### Run static analysis for a single shell script:
```yml
```

#### Run static analysis for multiple shell scripts **with or without** extension:
```yml
```

#### Run static analysis for all the shell scripts in a folder:
```yml
```

#### Run static analysis using a **wildcard** path:
```yml
```
#### Exclude files and folders from the static analysis:
```yml
```
Note that `exclude-paths` only accepts paths relative to your project\'s root directory. However, **do not** include `./` at the beginning of the paths. 

To exclude a folder and it\'s content recursively just provide the path of the folder **without** a `/` at the end. In the example above, the entire folder at the path `tests/unit_tests` will be excluded from linting.

#### Run static analysis for all the shell scripts and only report issue with error severity:
```yml
          severity: ""error""
```
#### Run analysis by using a specific version of Shell Linter:
```yml
```

# Input

### `path`
Optional. Execute lint check on a specific file or folder. Default: `.`

### `exclude-paths`

1059,"# Jira Extract Issue Keys

This Github Action parses all the possible issue keys from the commit message.

## Requirements

Issue keys must use capital letters and must have a dash ('-') between the letters and digits. There should be no spaces between the characters of an issue key.

Example: `EXAMPLE-123 TH-1S 1s a commit-1` the only issue key is EXAMPLE-123

## Action Specifications

### Input values

#### Required

Inside your .yml file there should be something that looks like this required variable:

###### Environment variables

```
```

For more information on Github Environment Variables, see https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables

###### Optional variables

```
```

- `is-pull-request` - is true if the GitHub event is a pull request. Default value is false.
- `parse-all-commits` - is true if the GitHub event is a push. Default value is false.
- `commit-message` - commit message to be parsed for jira keys. If it is hardcoded like the example above, the smart commits do not send commit information to the hardcoded Jira issues. The default is the commit message, where the smart commits do send information to the issue keys found in the user's commit message.

### Output value

- `jira-keys` - All of the keys found in the commit. 
    - If is-pull-request was true, then it has all of the keys from all of the commits that were found in the pull request.

1060,"# Jira Upload Deployment Info

This Github Action uploads deployment information to specified Jira issues belonging to a connected Jira Cloud instance via the Jira Software REST API. 

## Requirements

#### GitHub and Jira Cloud

Have the `GitHub for Jira` app installed on the Jira Cloud instance you plan to use. 

Have `Jira Software + GitHub` installed on your GitHub account. It can be found at:
> https://github.com/marketplace/jira-software-github

Make sure these two are connected. To do this, in Jira Cloud go to  `Settings -> Apps -> Manage Apps -> GitHub`. Click on \'Get Started\' to begin connecting yourself to your GitHub account. 

#### Action Secrets
This action requires three secrets to be stored in GitHub. These can be named whatever you want, but for this example they will be `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` to go with the required inputs for this action.

In Jira Cloud, navigate to `Settings -> Apps -> OAth credentials`. If you do not have credentials set up to your GitHub account already, create new credentials. The App name can be anything, the Server base URL and Logo URL can be your GitHub account: i.e. https://<span></span>github.com/your-github-account. Set permissions as Delopyments: allowed, Builds: allowed, and Development Information: allowed.

`CLIENT_ID` is the Client ID generated in OAth credentials.

`CLIENT_SECRET` is the Client Secret generated in OAth credentials.

Navigate to `Github Repository -> Settings -> Secrets` if you do not already have the secrets saved in the GitHub repository\'s secrets. Add the ones you are missing.

# GitHub Action for Running tests

This repository contains a simple GitHub Action which allows you to run a shell-script every time an event occurs within your repository.

* [GitHub Action for Running tests](#github-action-for-running-tests)
  * [Overview](#overview)
  * [Enabling the action](#enabling-the-action)
  * [Sample Configuration](#sample-configuration)
  * [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration)


## Overview

This action allows you to run a shell-script when your workflow action is triggered.  If your script terminates with an exit-code of 0 that is regarded as a pass, otherwise the action will be marked as a failure.

The expectation is that you\'ll use this action to launch your project-specific test-cases, ensuring that all pull-requests, commits, or both, are tested automatically.

Because the action ultimately executes a shell-script contained in your repository you can be as simple or complex as you can like, for example a [golang](https://golang.org/) project might contain a script such as this:

    #!/bin/sh
    # Run the go-vet tool.
    go vet ./..           || exit 1
    # Run the test-cases, with race-detection.
    go test -race ./...   || exit 1
    # Everything passed, exit cleanly.
    exit 0

A C-based project could contain something like this instead:

    #!/bin/sh
    make && make test

But as you can install/invoke arbitrary commands, and update them as your project grows, you can do almost anything you wish.



## Enabling the action

There are two steps required to use this action:

* Enable the action inside your repository.
  * You\'ll probably want to enable it upon pull-requests, to ensure their quality.
  * You might also want to enable it to run each time a push is made to your repository, for completeness.
* Add your project-specific test-steps to a script in your repository.
  * By default this action will execute `.github/run-tests.sh`, but you can specify a different name if you prefer.
  * The exit-code of your script will determine the result.



## Sample Configuration

Defining Github Actions requires that you create a directory `.github/workflows` inside your repository.  Inside the workflow-directory you create files which are processed when various events occur.

For example:

* .`github/workflows/pull_request.yml`
  * This is used when a pull-request is created/updated upon your repository.
* `.github/workflows/push.yml`
  * This is used when a commit is pushed to your repository.

The simplest example of using this action would be to create the file `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
```

This example will run the default test-script, `.github/run-tests.sh`, every time a pull-request is created, edited, or updated.



## Advanced Configuration

As noted github actions can be launched on multiple events, for example pushes to branches, new releases, pull-request related events, and similar.

Because you probably wish to run different tests/scripts on these different events it is possible to override the name/path of the shell-script which is executed on a per-event basis.

For example you might wish to run more thorough tests upon pull-requests, and a smaller subset when a push is made to your `master` branch (on the assumption that commits there are rare, and the usual workflow will have ensured the full-tests will have been executed via pull-requests).

As an example you might create a workflow for use solely with pushes to master, in the file `.github/workflows/push.yml`:

```yml
```

Here we\'ve done two things:

* We\'ve limited the action to only apply to pushes made to the `master` branch.
* We\'ve explicitly set the name of the testing-script to `.github/fast-tests.sh`
  * With the expectation this script contains only ""quick"" tests.
  * With slower tests being applied to pull-requests.

1064,"# git-pr-release-action

Create a pull-request for the production release.

If your team adopts a workflow like 'GitLab flow', you may have two branches, such as production and pre-production (or staging and so on).
This action helps to list up pull-requests related to commits between production and pre-production. And creates (or updates) a new pull-request with the list in the body.

This action is inspired by [motemen/git-pr-release](https://github.com/motemen/git-pr-release) and [uiur/github-pr-release](https://github.com/uiur/github-pr-release).

## Usage

This Action subscribes to Push events.

```workflow
```

**input**

- `owner`: Default is current reopsitory's owner.
- `repo`: Default is current reopsitory's name.
- `base`: **required** Base branch of the release pull-request.
- `head`: **required** Head branch of the release pull-request. Typically, it is the same as a subscribed branch.
- `assign`: If true, assign each pull-req's assignees to the release pull-req
- `labels`: Labels that is added to the release pull-request
- `template`: Path to the template you want to use.
- `tz`: Used to generate the version string.
- `token`: **required** `GITHUB_TOKEN` for creating a pull request.

Note that this action uses the template file in your repository. So you need 'checkout' step if you specify template option.

1065,"# GitHub Action - Delete Draft Releases

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/) to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to delete draft releases.

[![Tests](https://github.com/hugo19941994/delete-draft-releases/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hugo19941994/delete-draft-releases/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

**No outputs are available in this version.**

**Only the first 30 releases from a repo are checked.**

### Example workflows

On every `push` it deletes any release marked as a draft:

```yaml
```

To delete drafts older than a certain amount of time you can use the threshold input

```yaml
```

The minimum amount of time is 1 second

[Available units of time](https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration#readme):

* seconds `s`
* minutes `m` `min`
* hours `h` `hr`
* days `d`
* weeks `w` `wk`
* months
* years `y` `yr`

# Delete merged branch

[![Build Status](https://github.com/SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch/workflows/Test%20bot%20e2e/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch/actions)
_Want to see more badges? [Click here](#badges)!_


_Want to run this app with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)? [Click here](#running-in-github-actions)_

A GitHub app built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically deletes a branch after it's merged. That's it, enjoy! 

### \xf0\x9f\x94\x94 Wait, do you really need this? \xf0\x9f\x94\x94
You may not need this app as GitHub [recently added this feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-07-31-automatically-delete-head-branches-of-pull-requests/) natively to their platform. It allows you to automatically delete the head branch after a merge. If you need more advanced controls and configuration settings, this app is still well suited for the job. 


## Running it locally
1. First, follow [these instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configure-a-github-app) for making your own GitHub app.
    1. Give your app the following permissions:
          - Repository contents: Read & Write.
          - Pull requests: Read
    2. And Subscribe to the following events
          - Pull Request

2. Then, clone the repo:
```sh
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the right environment variables as [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/configuration/)

4. Now, install app dependencies and run it:

```sh
```

## How it works
This GitHub app listens to the `pull_request.closed` webhook. If a pull request is closed and the connected branch is merged, it will delete the branch.

## Configuration
The optional app configuration YAML file should be saved as `.github/delete-merged-branch-config.yml`. At the moment it supports the following options:

- `exclude` _(array)_ - list of branches that should not be automatically deleted after a merge. Wildcards supported.
- `delete_closed_pr` _(bool)_ whether or not a branch should be deleted if PR is closed without merging

Example `.github/delete-merged-branch-config.yml`:

```
```

## Release process
CI (GitHub Actions) is in charge of releasing new versions of the GitHub App to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com). On every new commit to master we run [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to determine whether the major/minor/patch version should be incremented. If so, we update the version running in production.

## Running in GitHub actions
This app is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). You need to create a workflow that is triggered on the `pull_request` event for this. Then, you use this repo for the action. (`SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch@master`). Don't forget to check the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. That's it.

```yml
```

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for how this GitHub app could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions.

Place status badges as emojis next to repo links marked with `<!-- STATUS_BADGE -->`

<!-- There is a zero-width space (\xe2\x80\x8b) in every link in the markdown examples in order to not trigger the bot. They can be viewed as red dots using ""view raw"" on github -->

| Markdown                                                                        | Result                                                                                      |

See [Examples](#examples) for more examples. Be weary of copying the links in the markdown examples, as they contain hidden zero-width spaces in order to not trigger the bot.

## Required Inputs

### `path`

**Required**: Path of the file to parse and create/update status badges for.

### `token`

**Required**: Github token for making request to other (public) repos, and pushing status badge updates to your repo. You can use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.

### Optional Inputs

See [Customization](#customization)

## Usage

Example workflow file that updates status badges every 24 hours found inside `README.md`. `on: workflow_dispatch` also allows you to run the workflow manually as needed.

Note that the `actions/checkout` step is required.

```yaml
```

1068,"# Swagger UI Action [![build-test](https://github.com/Legion2/swagger-ui-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Legion2/swagger-ui-action/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild-test+branch%3Amain)
Generate Swagger UI static html files and configuration to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

> This action only works on linux runners.
## How to Use
This Action supports four different configuration modes:
 * `spec-file`: File path to local OpenAPI or Swagger specification document
 * `spec-url`: URL of an OpenAPI or Swagger specification document
 * `swagger-config-file`: File path to local swagger configuration file
 * `swagger-config-url`: URL of a swagger configuration file

Use `spec-file` or `spec-url` when you have an OpenAPI or Swagger specification document and want a basic Swagger UI generated for it.
If you want to customize the created Swagger UI, you should use the `swagger-config-file` or the `swagger-config-url` configuration modes.
For information about the advanced swagger-config see the [Swagger UI Configuration documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/).

Note that, if `swagger-config-file` or `swagger-config-url` are used, no files specified in the `swagger-config.yaml` are copied by this action.
In this case, it is your responsibility to copy required files such as the OpenAPI document where you need them (output directory).

The output directory of the generated Swagger UI must be set with the `output` argument of the Action.
Optionally the Swagger UI version can be set with the `version` input, it accepts semver ranges.

### Example
This Action only generates the Swagger UI.
For example, to deploy it to GitHub Pages another Action is required.

Example steps from a workflow to generate and deploy Swagger UI to GitHub Pages:
```yaml
```

For a full example have a look at [this workflow file](https://github.com/Legion2/open-cue-service/blob/master/.github/workflows/pages.yml).

## Development

The Action runs from GitHub this repo, so the packed dist folder must be added to git. 

Release a new version:
```bash
```

Then create a release on GitHub.

1071,"# Delete old packages

GitHub action for deleting old versions of packages in the GitHub package registry.

This is very similar to [actions/delete-package-versions](https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions)
but targets a different use case.

The action works by getting at most 20 packages with at most the oldest 100 versions of each, applying the filters (see
table below) on them and then deleting the matching versions.

> If you have more than 100 versions and none of the 100 oldest versions match, no packages will be deleted!

> :warning: Certain options can not be combined with each other and will lead to errors. These are:
> - `user` and `organization`.
> - `semver-pattern` and `version-pattern`.

Supported package types as of the current version are: `npm`, `maven`, `rubygems`, `docker`, `nuget` and `container`.

A `token` might be needed, based on which package you are trying to delete. Tokens can be
generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and need to be added as a secret to the repository
(Settings -> Security -> Secrets and variables -> Actions).

### Example usage

> Delete old versions of the packages ""package-1"" and ""package-2"" for the organization ""my-organization"".

```yaml
```

> Delete old versions in the form of ""1.0.0-RC1"" of the package ""package"".

```yaml
```

> Delete old versions with a lower semver version than 2.x of the package ""package"".

```yaml
```

> Delete old versions of the package ""package"" but keep at least 5 versions.

```yaml
```

> Delete old versions of the package ""package"" with a token named ""GH_ACCESS_TOKEN"".

```yaml
```

### Rate limit

When using this action with many packages and/or versions you might encounter an error like ""API rate limit exceeded"".
Internally, the action uses a plugin for octokit which automatically retries requests when the rate limit is exceeded.
In these cases, the rate limit `retry after` returned from the GitHub api during a request is used to wait before
retrying, up to five times. If the rate limit is exceeded more than five times, the action will fail.

```

# \xf0\x9f\x93\x98 GHCR Container Retention Policy

A GitHub Action for deleting old image versions from the GitHub container registry.

Storage isn\'t free and registries can often get bloated with unused images. Having a retention policy to prevent clutter
makes sense in most cases.

Supports both organizational and personal accounts.

# Usage

To use the action, simply add it to your GitHub workflow, like this:

```yaml
```

Notice image-names supports wildcards.

You could run this as
a [scheduled event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule), or as a part
of an existing workflow, but for the sake of inspiration, it might also make sense for you to trigger it with a:

- [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch):
  trigger it manually in the GitHub repo UI when needed
- [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run): have it run
  as clean-up after another key workflow completes
- or triggering it with a
  webhook ([repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch))

# Examples

For an organization, a full example might look something like this:

```yaml
```

While for a personal account, something like this might do:

```yaml
```

An example showing 2 different retention policies based on image tags format:

```yaml
```

# Parameters

## image-names

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `image-names: image1,image2,image3` or just `image*`

The names of the container images you want to delete old versions for. Takes one or several container image names as a
comma separated list, and supports wildcards. The action will fetch all packages available, and filter
down the list of packages to handle based on the image name input.

## cut-off

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `cut-off: 1 week ago UTC`

The timezone-aware datetime you want to delete container versions that are older than.

We use [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to parse the cut-off specified. This means you should
be able to specify your cut-off in relative human readable terms like `Two hours ago UTC`, or by using a normal
timestamp.

The parsed datetime **must** contain a timezone.

## timestamp-to-use

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `timestamp-to-use: created_at`
* **Default**: `updated_at`
* **Valid choices**: `updated_at` or `created_at`

Which timestamp to use when comparing the cut-off to the container version.

Must be `created_at` or `updated_at`. The timestamp to use determines how we filter container versions.

## account-type

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `account-type: personal`
* **Valid choices**: `org` or `personal`

The account type of the account running the action. The account type determines which API endpoints to use in the GitHub
API.

## org-name

* **Required**: `Only if account type is org`
* **Example**: `org-name: google`

The name of your organization.

## token

* **Required**: `Yes`
* **Example**: `token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}`

For the token, you need to pass
a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with access to the container registry. Specifically, you need to grant it the following scopes:

- `read:packages`, and
- `delete:packages`

## keep-at-least

* **Required**: `No`
* **Default**: `0`
* **Example**: `keep-at-least: 5`

How many versions to keep no matter what. Defaults to 0, meaning all versions older than the `cut-off` date may be deleted.

Setting this to a larger value ensures that the specified number of recent versions are always retained, regardless of their age. Useful for images that are not updated very often.

If used together with `filter-tags` parameter, `keep-at-least` number of image tags will be skipped from the resulting filtered set, which makes it possible to apply different retention policies based on image tag format.

## untagged-only

* **Required**: `No`
* **Default**: `false`

Restricts image deletion to images without any tags, if enabled.

## skip-tags

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `latest, v*`

Restrict deletions to images without specific tags, if specified.

Supports Unix-shell style wildcards, i.e \'v*\' to match all tags starting with \'v\'.

## filter-tags

* **Required**: `No`
* **Example**: `sha-*`

Comma-separated list of tags to consider for deletion.

Supports Unix-shell style wildcards, i.e \'sha-*\' to match all tags starting with \'sha-\'.

## filter-include-untagged

* **Required**: `No`
* **Default**: `true`

Whether to consider untagged images for deletion.

## dry-run

* **Required**: `No`
* **Default**: `false`

Prints output showing imaages which would be deleted but does not actually delete any images.

# Outputs

## deleted

Comma-separated list of `image-name:version-id` for each image deleted.

## failed

Comma-separated list of images that we weren\'t able to delete. Check
logs for responses.

## needs-github-assistance

When a container image version is public and reaches
5,000 downloads, the image version can no longer
be deleted via the Github API.

If you run into this issue, you can access the names and versions
of the relevant images by calling `${{ steps.<the-id-of-the-deletion-step>.outputs.needs-github-assistance }}`.

The names and versions are output as a comma-separate list,
like `""name1:tag1,name2:tag2""`.

# Nice to knows

* The GitHub API restricts us to fetching 100 image versions per image name, so if your registry isn\'t 100% clean after
  the first job, don\'t be alarmed.

* If you accidentally delete something you shouldn\'t have, GitHub apparently has a 30 day grace period before actually
  deleting your image version.
  See [these docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/packages#restore-package-version-for-an-organization)
  for the information you need to restore your data.

> Download the base artifact for the current workflow.

For pull requests, this action looks at the branch the pull request is open against, finds the last successful workflow run for that branch, and downloads the artifact for that workflow run. For pushes, this action looks as the commit id for the branch before the push happened, finds a successful workflow run for that commit (falls back to the last successful for the branch if that commit broke the build), and downloads the artifact for that workflow run.


## Usage

This action could be used to:

* Download size metadata about the previous build and compare it against sizes for the current build
* Download the build output of a previous build to benchmark against the output of the current build
* Other things I haven\'t thought of!

# PR Gatekeeper

This action is a status check to validate if specific reviewers have provided approvals within your PR workflows. Repo owners/ admins can configure the following:
- The minimum no. of approvals needed 
- The various groups and it\'s members and minimum no. of approvals within each group
- _The action currently supports only people and not GitHub teams_

## How this action works
This action is triggered every time some change is made to the pull request (see [workflow example](#Workflow-config)). It checks whether the review and approval status of the pull request meets the policy described in the [action\'s config](#Action-config), and sets the result to a commit status named ""PR Gatekeeper Status"".

![screenshot](./images/commit-status.png)
You can enforce the review policy described in [action\'s config](#Action-config) by setting this ""PR Gatekeeper Status"" as required in the protected branch settings.

## How does it work alongside my repo\'s Branch Protection Rules(BPR)
PR Gatekeeper works in tandem with Branch Protection Rules, and helps enforce more finer policy controls. 

Branch Protection rules checks if the configured number of people have approved the PR and if yes, returns a `pass` signal. In situations where approvals from a specific people across specific teams is needed, Branch Protection Rules are unable to enforce. This is a common enterprise usecase, where select changes need approvals from Security, Quality & Infra teams for auditory & compliance purposes.

## How do I configure this to work in tandem with the repo\'s Branch Protection Rules(BPR)
1. Ensure that ""PR Gatekeeper Status"" is a required status check in the Branch Protection settings.
2. Define either the PR Gatekeeper `minimum` approvals within the [action\'s config](#Action-config) or in BPR\'s \'Required number of approvals before merging\' field
<img width=""766"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83639549/192690706-d6448d13-40c6-4dd8-9027-6b26572d7003.png"">
3. If both of the above fields are defined, ensure that the PR Gatekeeper\'s minimum no. of approvals should be greater than or equal to the BPR\'s required no. of approvals

## Configuration
### Action config
The action is configured via the `approve_config.yml` file located in the `.github` subdirectory. The general format is as follows.
```yaml
```

### Workflow config

Once the `approve_config.yml` file is in place, add the action to execute on every PR and then set it as a required action to start enforcing your new approval policy!

```yaml
```

### Prerequisites

#### [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

`yarn` is used to handle dependencies and executing scripts on the codebase.

See [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable) for instructions on installing yarn on your local machine.

Once you have installed `yarn`, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command from within the project root directory:

```bash
```

1078,"# Xcode Notarize

This action notarizes macOS applications or plug-ins. It does this by submitting your built `.app` (or non-app bundle) to Apple\'s notarization service. It will poll the notarization service until it times out of receives a success response.

> Notarization is a complicated process, but the gist of it is this: if you want to distribute your macOS application outside of the Mac App Store, you need to Sign and Notarize your application. This Action only needs two inputs for that: the `product-path` that points your application and your AppStore Connect credentials with `appstore-connect-username` / `appstore-connect-password`. (This need to be an _App Specific Password_ as regular accounts require 2FA)

## Basic Usage

```yaml
```

Note that notarization is not the final step. After Apple has notarized your application, you also want to _staple_ a notarization ticket to your product. This can be done with the [Xcode Staple](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/xcode-staple) action.

## Full Example

The [devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings) project is an example macOS project with a [release.yml](https://github.com/devbotsxyz/example-macos-rings/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow that shows all the steps needed to go from creating a release in GitHub to ending up with a `.zip` file that contains a signed and notarized application.

1079,"# GitHub Contributors Action

The action can be used to fetch all contributors\' information for either 
a particular repository or an organization. In case of an organization
all the repositories visible to the token user will be pulled. Resulting
contributor information is checked for duplications.

To use the action, define the template file, let the
tool get you the result in the expected format. The output from
the tool is captured in an output file. Highly useful if you would
like to highlight contributors of a project.

## Usage

The tool works by accepting following environment variables

| ENV Variable                     | What is it used for?                                                               | Default Value                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN                | GitHub access token with access to the repository                                  |                                                |
| SOURCE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY         | Repository to poll the collaborators information. It can be a simple organization field, in which case all repositories are polled for the required information                                 | hyperledger-tooling/github-contributors-action |
| CONTRIBUTORS_SECTION_PATTERN     | Pattern after which the contributors information is to be dumped                   | # # Contributors                                |
| CONTRIBUTORS_SECTION_END_PATTERN | Pattern to end adding the contributors information. This would mean all contributors information will be added in between `CONTRIBUTORS_SECTION_PATTERN` and `CONTRIBUTORS_SECTION_END_PATTERN` | # # Contributions                              |
| INPUT_TEMPLATE_FILE              | File used for creating the pattern in the output file                              | `assets/minimal.md`                            |
| FILE_WITH_PATTERN                | File where the generated data is dumped. Also, the file where pattern can be found | `README.md`                                    |

**Note 1:** An extra space is added between `##` in the `Default Value` column.
This is to avoid the action from corrupt formatting of this file.

**Note 2:** An example of pulling list of all organization contributors is
available at [Hyperledger Tooling Contributors](./all-contributors.md) page.

### Build

`Makefile` is provided to ease up the development, and auto-perform lint
checks as well as run tests if any. This is to maintain a good quality on
the codebase.

Run the following command from your terminal

```shell
```

In case of build failure because of format check, run the following command

```shell
```

This action allows you to retry shell command for a few times in case they fail. This is especially useful for all kind of network related tasks, such as downloading files or similar. In case the remote endpoint has some issues, the job will not simply fail because of this, but retry the command and eventually reach success.

The following inputs can be used to alter the Docker tag name determination:

| Input          | Required | Default | Description                                |
|----------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `retries`      | No       | `10`     | How many times to retry on failure.       |
| `pause`        | No       | `10`     | How many seconds to wait between retries. |
| `command`      | Yes      | ``       | Shell command to execute.                 |
| `workdir`      | No       | ``       | Switch to this working directory prior executing the shell command. |
| `fail_command` | No       | ``       | Shell command to execute on every failure of given `command`. |


## :arrow_backward: Outputs

GitHub Actions for [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Base on Docker official [PHP](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) image, and installed [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo) package. 

[ico-release]: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/MilesChou/composer-action.svg

## Why build another one image?

Actually, I want to follow DRY principle and use official [Composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) image. But see the following composer.json:

```json
```

And use the following workflow:

```yaml
```

It\'s expected to work on PHP 5.5 ~ 7.3, so we should test on every platform. However, Composer image will install on PHP 7.3 platform and it will install PHPUnit 6.x. It will failed on PHP 5.5 container for PHPUnit 6.x require [PHP ^7.0](https://packagist.org/packages/phpunit/phpunit#6.0.0).   

Of course, we can use the `config.platform.php` config to force platform version on PHP 5.5 and it will install PHPUnit 4.x, but PHPUnit 4.x use too many deprecated functions, e.g. [each()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.each.php), so that cannot work on PHP >=7.2.

Finally, I think that build image on every version is the good idea.

## Usage for GitHub Actions

Via GitHub Workflow

```yaml
```

Use install image

```yaml
```

With specify PHP version

```yaml
```

## What does this action do?

This action runs [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize).

## Usage

Define a workflow in `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml` (or add a job if you already have defined workflows).

:bulb: Read more about [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow).

### Default Behaviour

By default this action will run

```
```

in the working directory.

When you use this action in a step with the default behaviour, the step will fail when

- `composer.json` does not exist in this directory (be sure to checkout the code first, see [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))
- `composer.json` is not valid
- `composer.json` is valid, but `composer.lock` is not up-to-date with `composer.json`

and the step will succeed when

- `composer.json` is valid, `composer.lock` is not present, and `composer.json` and not yet normalized or could be successfully normalized
- `composer.json` is valid, `composer.lock` is present and up-to-date, and `composer.json`, and `composer.json` and not yet normalized or could be successfully normalized

:bulb: If you want the step to fail when `composer.json` is not yet normalized, you need to run with the `--dry-run` options, see below.

Here\'s an example for a workflow configuration with the default behaviour:

```yaml
```

### Custom Behavior

If you prefer to specify [arguments](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/tree/main#arguments) or [options](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/main#options) yourself, you can configure those using the `args` option:

```diff
```

### Docker image

As Docker images are automatically built and pushed on a merge to `main` or when a new tag is created in this repository, the recommended way to use this GitHub action is to reference the pre-built Docker image directly, as seen above.

:bulb: The Docker image can also be executed directly by running

```
```

For more information, see the [Docker Docs: Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

Instead of using the latest pre-built Docker image, you can also specify a Docker image tag (which corresponds to the tags [released on GitHub](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/releases)):

```diff
```

1087,"# GitHub Action to run PHP_CodeSniffer of files changed in current PR or even on changed lines

This action runs [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) on files changed in a Pull Request, by default annotating only lines changed by the PR author. So, it\'s fast and great to work with legacy code:

![annotations](.github/screenshot-phpcs-action.png)

Contrary to some existing solutions this actions works faster than Docker based actions (as it runs from Node.JS directly in the same VM) and runs only on changed files (good 
for big projects with some non-conform files as well as to gradually introduce code style).

## Usage

Add a file like this to `.github/workflows/phpcs.yml`:

```yml
```

You also will need either to pick a build code style standard or create `phpcs.xml` file (like [this](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/phpcs.xml) for example).
You may find all available configuration options at [action.yml](action.yml) in this repository.
Example of this action running over small change in big legacy codebase: https://github.com/tinovyatkin/woocommerce/pull/1/checks?check_run_id=642017335

1088,"# phpunit-coverage-badge

![Code Coverage Badge](./badge.svg) 

This action calculates the test coverage using a PHPUnit report and generates an SVG badge from it. Supported report types right now are clover and html. Using the html report is only tested with the html file generated by PHPUnit 9.5.0 and might not work in old or future releases if the layout of the report changes. Therefore it is recommended to use the clover report.

The generated badge can also be pushed to the repository to be displayed in the README (or wherever else you might need it).
An example is the badge above this text block, which shows the current test coverage of this project.

Inspired by [cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator) and [richardregeer/phpunit-coverage-check](https://github.com/richardregeer/phpunit-coverage-check).

The template for the svg badge was created using [Method Draw](http://github.com/duopixel/Method-Draw). The color scheme for the background of the coverage percentage number has been adapted from [cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator).

# Configuration
This action has no required inputs. It defaults to using a clover report saved in the root directory (clover.xml). 

For the action to be able to parse the clover report and push it to the repository, you need to run the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) before running this action.
Basic configuration for the checkout action works like this:
```
```
IMPORTANT: v1.0.0 currently has NO support for a custom checkout path.

You can automatically generate a clover report file with every PHPUnit run by adding the following configuration to your phpunit.xml file:
```
```

# Recommended configuration

This configuration commits the output badge to branch `image-data`. As a consequence, this avoids the list of issues with the alternate configuration (see below), namely:

- bot commiting to the master branch
- constant need to git pull before you can push your latest changes
- phpunit report and badge inside your repository

```yml
```

In addition, pushing the badge requires you to update your project settings under `Code and automation` > `Actions` > `General` > `Workflow permissions` to `Read and write permissions`. Please note that a separate action `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` is used to push the result.

# Alternate configuration

Setting the input **push_badge** in your workflow to true will enable the commit and push process and the badge will be pushed into the repository after it\'s been generated. Please note: The parsed report file will also be committed and pushed if it changes during the workflow.

```yml
```

Please have a look at the inputs for all configuration options in `actions.yml`.

# Troubleshooting

## Commit by action triggers another action run
As reported by [MikeDevresse](https://github.com/MikeDevresse) in [this issue](https://github.com/timkrase/phpunit-coverage-badge/issues/7), it might be possible that the commit by the Github action triggers a subsequent action run. Adding a specific tag to the actions github action and then checking for the existance of this tag can be used as a workaround (example is a slightly modified version of the one given by MikeDevresse in the issue):
```
```

# Inputs

Paths are always relative to the root of your repository.

## Badge generation

# :white_check_mark: StandardRB Action

A GitHub Action to run [StandardRB](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) against your code and create annotations in the GitHub UI.

## :page_facing_up: Introduction

GitHub Actions are an amazing new tool that can dramatically improve productivity while using the GitHub platform. While it is not hard to write a custom GitHub action to run StandardRB on your codebase, this action takes that functionality one step further using the checks API. After the StandardRB Linter Action runs StandardRB against your code, it will create annotations that you can easily view, matched up with the offending code.

Since GitHub actions and the checks API are continually changing, it is possible that there will be breaking API changes that affect this action. If so, please open an issue and I will look into it as soon as I can.

## :bulb: Usage

Add the following to your GitHub action workflow to use StandardRB Linter Action:

```yaml
```

### :package: Example Workflow

Here is an example workflow file incorporating StandardRB Linter Action:

```yaml
```

## :warning: Gotchas

Due to the GitHub Check Runs API, we can only return 50 annotations per run. See [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#output-object) for more info.

Hey, there! \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b

This project is done in terms of features. If the project is severely broken due to a change in GitHub or RuboCop, it will be archived at that time and left to those that care about it to fork, fix, and maintain.

I will be happy to review your pull request, but will not be adding any more myself, and make no guarantees I will accept anything that adds behavior. Please read the [introduction](#introduction) for my thoughts on why you should not use this action.

This being said, I will be happy to give you contributor access if you\'re interested in becoming a maintainer. If I don\'t respond within a day or two through issues, you may email me (for this reason **only**) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes). Truthfully this project makes me feel very burnt out whenever I am around it, especially since I have not actually used it in months.

Thanks for understanding,

# RuboCop Linter Action

RuboCop Linter Action is a GitHub Action to run [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) against your Ruby codebase and output the results in the [GitHub Checks UI](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-07-new-checks-api-public-beta/).

> IMPORTANT: The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.

This is straight out of [GitHub\'s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#create-a-check-run).

Put simply, **this action will not work on pull requests from a forked repository**, making it basically useless for open source repositories.

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ACTION**, and instead follow [the Rails way](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4a78dcb326e57b5035c4df322e31875bfa74ae23/.github/workflows/rubocop.yml#L1).

## Quickstart

> IMPORTANT: This action does not run `bundle install` by default. In order to install gems via bundler, you will need to update your configuration file. See more below.

The default usage, similar to running `gem install rubocop && rubocop` from your command line:

```yaml
```

## Introduction

This GitHub Action provides a way to easily run RuboCop on your codebase, and output the results to the view via [GitHub Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks)

While it is **recommended** to write a custom GitHub Action to run RuboCop on your codebase, this action takes that functionality one step further using Checks. After the RuboCop Linter Action runs RuboCop against your Ruby code, it will create annotations that you can easily view in the GitHub UI, matched up with the offending code.

At this point the Checks API has been in beta over two years, and it is still possible that there will be breaking API changes that affect this action. If this occurs, please open a pull request to fix it.

**Are you sure you need this action?**

I would truly recommend **not** using this action. The potential for random breaking changes from GitHub will always be a looming threat and I have ascertained people are using this action as a crutch to avoid what they really ought be doing.

If you find yourself constantly having to wade through RuboCop errors in GitHub, the fix is to not allow them to get to GitHub broken in the first place. I would highly suggest using a tool like [lefthook](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook) or similar to flag or fix failing cops before they get to GitHub Actions, saving you and your team time and removing the need for this action.

### Configuration

### Inputs

**`action_config_path`**

**Defintion**

The only input accepted for the action, which allows you to specify a custom location for the action config file.

**Default**

`.github/config/rubocop_linter_action.yml`

### Simple Config

This is simple config file showing how you could choose to change the version numbers, but use defaults for the rest:

```yml
```

### Default Config

```yml
```

### Version Constraints

It is **highly** recommend you tie yourself to a version and do not do the following. I promise your life will be much easier. \xf0\x9f\x98\x87

```yml
```

### Spec

```yml
```

### Usage

```yml
```

### Example Workflow

Here is an example workflow file incorporating RuboCop Linter Action with customized usage based on the values in your configuration file:

```yaml
```

### Updates

Since the action will default to the latest RuboCop release, you may run into isues with outdated config options that are specified in your `.rubocop.yml`. To easily upgrade your config, use [mry](https://github.com/pocke/mry).

### RuboCop Docs

Several of the config options map directly to RuboCop\'s inputs. Check [their documentation](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage/#command-line-flags) for help or more info.

### FAQ

_If you cannot find an answer here that you think should be included, let us know!!_

**1. Why is my check result being shown under the wrong header?**

There is a bug with Checks that might cause your runs to get jumbled in the UI, but they will all still run and render annotations in the diff correctly. Hopefully this will get fixed or we figure out that we are doing something wrong that is fixable.

**2. How come I can\'t create checks on forked repositories? [(example)](https://github.com/ruby/spec/commit/1cfa9f188e8342993d149807210b6777189cfe3f/checks?check_suite_id=335929828)**

> NOTE: The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.

This is straight out of GitHub\'s documentation. Put simply, this action won\'t work correctly on pull requests from a forked repository as is.

I am open to a PR that will just output the results of the RuboCop run to the actions log if someone would like to take a shot at adding that!

**3. The modified flag is not working!**

If you specify the following in your config file:

```yaml
```

Please note that this will not work on commits to master. If you have an idea on how to make this work, please open an issue or PR!

**4. My GitHub Checks results don\'t match the output of running RuboCop locally.**

Make sure you\'re running the same version of RuboCop that the linter is using. If using Bundler, try running `bundle update rubocop`. If you need the linter to use an older version, you can specify it in the config file:

```yaml
```

## Config options

### exit_on_failure

Stop the workflow execution if the linter returns some failures.

```yaml
```

1093,"# GitHub Action for building a project

This repository contains a simple GitHub Action implementation, which allows you to build your project, in a repository-specific fashion.

The expectation is that you would create an action-based workflow:

* Checkout the code.
* Run the tests.
* Run the build, generating your artifacts.
* Upload the artifacts.
  * Perhaps using my [github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries/) action.


## Enabling the action

There are two steps required to use this action:

* Enable the action inside your repository.
  * This might mean creating a file `.github/workflows/release.yml` which is where the action is invoked for release-steps, for example.
* Add your project-specific `.github/build` script.
  * This is the script which will actually carry out your build-steps.
    * A C-project might just run `make`.
    * A golang-based project might run `go build .` multiple times for different architectures.


## Sample Configuration

This configuration runs the script `.github/build` every time a release is made of your project, and is defined in the file `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yml
```

We assume that the `.github/build` script generated a series of binaries, and these can be acccessed by later steps in your workflow.  For example you might use my uploading-action:

* [https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries)

Of course you can specify a different script name, via the `builder` argument in your workflow file.

1094,"# YAML Update Action

Update values in an existing YAML or JSON File. Push this updated File to an existing branch or create a new branch. Open a PullRequest to a configurable targetBranch. It is also possible to change the file locally without committing the change.


## Use Cases

### Change a local YAML file without committing the change

With the latest release, the content of your actual file will be updated by default. So, you just need to skip the commit of your change.

```yaml
```

### Update Helm Chart after a new Docker Image was build

Update the image version configuration inside of my helm `values.yaml` after the related GitHub Workflow build and pushed a new version of my Docker Image to the GitHub Package Registry.

```yaml
```

### Output

- `commit` Git Commit SHA
- `pull_request` Git PR Information

## Debug Information

Enable Debug mode to get information about

- YAML parse and update results
- Git Steps

## Known Issues

In this first version the updated YAML file will not be patched. It is parsed into JSON, after the update its converted back to YAML. This means that comments and blank lines will be removed in this process and the intend of the updated content can be different to the previous.

By default, each value will be interpreted as string. To use other kinds of value types you can use the specified YAML tags as shown here: [JS-YAML -Supported YAML types](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#supported-yaml-types). Use this syntax as string, see the [test workflows](https://github.com/fjogeleit/yaml-update-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) as example

1095,"# Go Dependency Submission

This GitHub Action calculates dependencies for a Go build-target (a Go file with a
`main` function) and submits the list to the [Dependency submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api). Dependencies then appear in your repository\'s dependency graph, and you\'ll receive Dependabot alerts and updates for vulnerable or out-of-date dependencies. 

### Running locally

Because we are checking in the Typescript output, you may see check failures if you don\'t generate the contents of `dist/` in a similar manner to our CI check. You can easily rectify this by regenerating in a codespace and using what we use in our workflow YAML:

```
```

### Example
```yaml
```

1098,"# [DEPRECATED] go-mod-tidy-pr
Run `go mod tidy` and create PullRequest on GitHub Actions

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/go-mod-tidy-pr

This is inspired by [circleci-bundle-update-pr](https://github.com/masutaka/circleci-bundle-update-pr)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/sue445/go-mod-tidy-pr/workflows/test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sue445/go-mod-tidy-pr/actions?query=workflow%3Atest)

## :warning: DEPRECATION
Now, Dependabot officially supports `go mod tidy`.

https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-19-dependabot-go-mod-tidy-and-vendor-support/

So this action is deprecated.

## Example
![example](img/example.png)

https://github.com/sue445/go-mod-tidy-pr/pull/12

## Usage
```yaml
```

## Parameters
* `github_token` **Required**
  *  GitHub Token
* `git_user_name` **Required**
  * Username for commit
* `git_user_email` **Required**
  * E-mail for commit
* `base`
  * The base branch in the ""[OWNER:]BRANCH"" format. Defaults to the default branch of the upstream repository (usually ""master"").
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `reviewer`
  * A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of GitHub handles to request a review from.
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `assign`
  * A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of GitHub handles to assign to this pull request.
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `milestone`
  * The milestone name to add to this pull request. Passing the milestone number is deprecated.
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `labels`
  * A comma-separated list (no spaces around the comma) of labels to add to this pull request. Labels will be created if they do not already exist.
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `draft`
  * Create the pull request as a draft.
  * See https://hub.github.com/hub-pull-request.1.html
* `go_mod_directory` **Required**
  * Directory where `go.mod` is located
  * Default. `.`
* `go_version`
  * Go version to be used. Defaults to the latest version.
* `debug`
  * Whether print debug logging
* `duplicate`
  * Whether create PullRequest even if it has already existed
* `timezone`
  * Timezone to be used if set (e.g. `Asia/Tokyo`)

## Note :warning:
If you configure Pull Request build on GitHub Action, builds **doesn\'t trigger** when `go-mod-tidy-pr` creates Pull Request.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token

The workaround is one of the following.

1. Use [GitHub App Token](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-app-token) instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` **(RECOMMENDED)**
    * Required permission: Pull requests (Read & write)
2. Use personal access token instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. Use CI other than GitHub Action on Pull Request build

1099,"# Configuring credentials

This action allows you to clone private git repositories using HTTP authentication.
The credentials should be passed to the action through the `credentials` parameter.
It is highly recommended to store the credentials in a secret and pass the secret to the action,
rather than hard-coding the credentials in the configuration file.

Note that the `checkout` action already allows you to clone the main repository.
This action is intended for downloading additional dependencies from private repositories.

The action stores the credentials in the file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials`,
and configures git to use it by calling `git config --global credential.helper store`/
The credentials should be list of URL patterns with authentication information.
See `man 7 git-credentials-store` for more details.

Additionally, the action configures git to rewrite SSH URLs for GitHub repositories to HTTPS URLs.
This allows dependencies to be specified using a SSH URLs for developers,
while the CI system will automatically clone over HTTPS with the provided credentials.

It is advisable to generate an access token specifically for your workflow.
Simply use the token in place of an account password in the credentials.
Be sure to grant full access for the `repo` scope to the token,
otherwise the token can not be used to clone private repositories.
Without the right permissions, the clone will normally fail with a 404 error.

A sample configuration for a workflow is shown here:
```yaml
```

The credentials secret would contain something like this:
```
```

It is also possible to provide additional credentials for different domains in the credentials list.

# Why not use a plain SSH key?
In general, a plain SSH key would be a good solution too.
However, at the moment Cargo (the Rust package manager) does not support SSH authentication other than through an SSH agent.
SSH agents are not meant to be used non-interactively, so HTTPS authentication is a simpler solution.

If you can use plain SSH keys that may be easier.

This actions generates cross-platform executable files from a Go module.

![release](/assets/release.png)
> Automatic release management of the [**tree**](https://github.com/thatisuday/tree/releases) CLI tool using **go-build-action** action.


## Workflow setup

```yaml
```

#### \xe2\x98\x89 option: **platforms**
The `platforms` option specifies comma-separated platform names to create binary-executable files for. To see the list of supported platforms, use `go tool dist list` command.

#### \xe2\x98\x89 option: **package**
If the module (_repository_) itself is a Go package, then `package` option value should be an empty string (''). If the repository contains a package directory, then `package` value should be the directory name.

#### \xe2\x98\x89 option: **compress**
The `compress` option if set to `'true'` will generate **compressed-tar** archive files for the each platform-build file. The resulting archive file also contains `README.md` and `LICENSE` file if they exist inside the root of the repository. In this mode, the binary executable file name is taken from the `name` option value.

#### \xe2\x98\x89 option: **name**
The `name` option sets a prefix for the build filenames. In compression mode, this prefix is applied to archive files and binary executable filename is set to this value.

#### \xe2\x98\x89 option: **dest**
The `dest` option sets the output directory for the build files. This should be a relative directory without leading `./`.


## Build Artifacts
This action produces following build-artifacts.

1102,"# ensure-latest-go

Ensure-latest-go is a GitHub Action to keep Dockerfiles, Travis CI configs,
and GitHub Actions using the latest stable version of Go.


This Action is designed to work in conjunction with `actions/checkout` and
`peter-evans/create-pull-request` to keep your repository on the latest released
version of Go. When a new Go release is discovered by it, a new pull request
will be generated with the appropriate changes to your configuration.

## Usage
Below is the common case configuration:

```yaml
```

To enjoy the full benefits with GitHub Actions, you\'ll need to add a `.github/versions/go` file to your repository with the version of Go you want `actions/setup-go` to use. Then, modify your `actions/setup-go` job to include:

```yaml
```

That\'ll get you pretty far. The default configuration documented above will
update any files named `Dockerfile` that use `FROM golang` statements, the
top-level `.travis.yml` file, and any GitHub Action files in
`.github/workflows/` that use `actions/setup-go`. If any of those files don\'t
exist, they\'ll just be skipped.

If you\'d like more control, there are a few optional arguments you can set with `with` (all file paths are relative to the top-level directory of the repository):

### Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| exclude | An optional comma-separated list of file paths  of any type that will not be updated.| none |
| dockerfiles | An optional comma-seperated list of Dockerfiles to update when a new Go version is released. If set, it will override the default behavior of updating any files named `Dockerfile` using a `golang` image. | none |
| travisfiles | An optional comma-seperated list of Travis CI config files to update when a new Go version is released. If set, it will override the default behavior of updating (but not creating) the ""go"" setting in a top-level .travis.yml file. | none |

### Outputs

This project also provides an output variable of the Go version it used in order
to generate clear pull requests. It\'s used in the common case example workflow
above.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| go_version | The version of Go used to update the configured files. |

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/extractions/setup-just/build.yaml?branch=trunk)](https://github.com/extractions/setup-just/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This GitHub Action will install a release of the
[just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner for you.

## Usage

### Examples

In most cases all you will need is the following in your workflow.

```yaml
```

If you want a specific version of `just` you can specify this by passing the
`just-version` input.

```yaml
  with:
    just-version: '1.4.0'
```

To avoid rate-limiting, the default Github token available to all actions, is
automatically used to authenticate calls to Github. To override it, set the
environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` or pass the input `github-token`.

```yaml
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

or

```yaml
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Inputs

| Name           | Required | Description                                  | Type   | Default               |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| `just-version` | no       | A valid NPM-style semver specification.      | string | *                     |
| `github-token` | no       | A Github token to authenticate API requests. | string | `${{ github.token }}` |

The semver specification is passed directly to NPM's [semver
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver). This GitHub Action will install
the latest matching release. Examples include

- `just-version: '*'` latest version (default).
- `just-version: '0.10'` equivalent to `>=0.10.0 <0.11.0`.
- `just-version: '0.10.x'` equivalent to `>=0.10.0 <0.11.0`.
- `just-version: '0.10.0'` equivalent to `=0.10.0`.
- `just-version: '^0.10.0'` equivalent to `>=0.10.0 <0.11.0`.

## Development

Most of the installation logic is done in a shared library located at
[@extractions/setup-crate](https://github.com/extractions/setup-crate).

The following commands are useful for development.

- `npm i`

  Install all dependencies.

- `npm run fmt`

  Format the source code.

- `npm run lint`

  Run all lints.

- `npm run run`

  Test the action by running it.

- `npm run build`

  Build the action and update `dist/`.

### Flow

1. Create a new branch
1. Commit
1. Merge the branch into `develop` branch
1. Push `develop` branch
1. Check passing all tests
1. Create a new pull request
1. Merge the branch into `master` branch

This actions is using a DockerHub image.  We must push `docker-v0.0.0` git-tag
to create a new tagged docker image.  Published a new tagged docker image, and
change tag of action.yml into `develop` branch, and check passing all tests,
and merge into `master`.

### Release

#### [haya14busa/action-bumpr](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-bumpr)

You can bump version on merging Pull Requests with specific labels (bump:major,bump:minor,bump:patch).
Pushing tag manually by yourself also work.

#### [haya14busa/action-update-semver](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-update-semver)

This action updates major/minor release tags on a tag push. e.g. Update v1 and v1.2 tag when released v1.2.3.

## Usage

#### Using Github actions

##### actions/checkout@v2

actions/checkout@v2 behaves differently from the first version. It pulls in just the latest commit and does not pull any other git objects. Release Notary needs these objects in order to work.

It should be run only on tags.

Example workflow file:

```yaml
```

##### actions/checkout@v1

Should be run only on tags, example is [HERE](https://github.com/aevea/commitsar/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml):

```yml
```

Checkout git in order to get commits and master branch

```yml
```

Run the Release Notary action. Github token needs to be explicitly added so that Release Notary can use it. See https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions

```yml
```

#### Gitlab CI

```yml
```

#### Using binary

Download and run: **(Substitute v0.0.2 for current version)**

```yml

This GitHub Action automatically installs azurite (Azure Storage Emulator) on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Azurite provides a free local environment for testing your Azure blob, queue storage, and table storage applications. When you\'re satisfied with how your application is working locally, you can then switch to using an Azure Storage account in the cloud. The emulator provides cross-platform support on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Azurite supersedes the Azure Storage Emulator. Azurite will continue to be updated to support the latest versions of Azure Storage APIs - [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite)

## Documentation

Just copy the code below to install and run Azure blob, queue storage, and table storage services over http.

```yaml
```

By default, blob storage runs over port 10000, queue storage runs over port 10001 and table storage runs over port 10002.

## Usage

## Notes
In macOS Big Sur and above, this action runs `sudo security authorizationdb write com.apple.trust-settings.admin allow` which allows all users to write to the certificate root store. This  is done in order to bypass a new requirement for interactive approval to add certificates to the root store, which is great when you are sitting at your computer, but not when you\'re running commands non-interactively (like within a GitHub Runner).

## Usage

### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).


### Inputs

- `version`: The version of terraform to install. Required.

### Outputs

None.

### Example workflow

```yaml
```

## FAQ

### Can you offer a major version tag/branch alias?  I want automatic updates!

Nope!  This was always weird/bad pattern of github actions.  Luckily github offers a solution for this.  Create a `.github/dependabot.yml` with, at a minimum, the following config:

```yaml
```

# Homebrew Releaser

Release scripts, binaries, and executables directly to Homebrew via GitHub Actions.

</div>

Homebrew Releaser allows you to release scripts, binaries, and executables directly to a personal Homebrew tap via a GitHub Action. I love what the team at [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) did and wanted to replicate that on a smaller and simpler scale for items like shell scripts or other non-go binaries I wanted to distribute.

When you cut a new release when using this GitHub Action, it will clone your repo and clone your Homebrew tap on CI, build the new formula Ruby file, create a `checksum.txt` file and upload it to your release containing the checksum(s) of your scripts/binaries, and then push the new formula to your Homebrew Tap. If you do not specify a `target` to use, the workflow will use the autogenerated tar archive from GitHub when you created a release, otherwise you can tell Homebrew Releaser which OS and arch pairs you have binaries for. See the accompanying target details below for the URL patterns to follow.

## Usage

**Notes:**

- Shell scripts distributed via Homebrew Releaser **must be executable** and contain a proper shebang to work.
- Homebrew Releaser **will always use the latest release** of a GitHub project. Git release tags must follow semantic versioning for Homebrew to properly infer the installation instructions (eg: `v1.2.0` or `0.3.0`, etc).
- The Homebrew formula filename will match the github repo name.
- It is **highly** recommended to enable debug mode and skip the commit on the first run through to ensure you have configured your workflow correctly and that the generated formula looks the way you want.
- Homebrew Releaser is **not** compatible with monorepos.
- Every precaution will be made to ensure that major releases of this action remain compatible (every `0.x` release of this action rebuilds and packages the `v1` action as a convenience to users). If you value stability over ""getting new features for free"", it\'s highly recommended to pin a specific version or commit hash of this action when using it (eg: `v0.16.0`)

### GitHub Actions YAML

After you release a project on GitHub, Homebrew Releaser can publish that release to a personal Homebrew tap by updating the project description, version, tar archive url, license, checksum, installation and testing command, and any other required info so you don\'t have to. You can check the [Homebrew documentation on taps](https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap) and the [formula cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) for more details on setting up a Homebrew formula or tap.

```yml
```

## Development

```bash
```

### Run Manually via Docker

Homebrew Releaser does not clean up artifacts after completing since the temporary Docker image on GitHub Actions will be discarded anyway.

**Note:** All environment variables from above must be prepended with `INPUT_` for the local Docker image (eg: `INPUT_SKIP_COMMIT=true`).

1114,"# Helm push action

This action uploads a chart to chartmuseum or another compatible chart manager using helm 3.

## Usage

### Chart setup

Assuming that you have a helm chart in your repository, here is an example partial file tree (You would set `SOURCE_DIR` to `charts`)

```
```

if the chart is at the top level, you would set `SOURCE_DIR` to `.`

```
```

You cannot have the helm chart files at the top level of the repository, as it prevents naming the chart for uploads.


### `workflow.yml` Example

Create a new Github Action in `.github/workflows/`. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

Minimal example for a chart located at `charts/chart1`:

```yaml
```

Full example:

```yaml
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `CHARTMUSEUM_USER` and `CHARTMUSEUM_PASSWORD`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository.

| Key | Value | Suggested Type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `CHART_FOLDER` | Folder with charts in repo | `env` | **Yes** |
| `CHARTMUSEUM_URL` | Chartmuseum url | `env` | **Yes** |
| `CHARTMUSEUM_USER` | Username for chartmuseum  | `secret` | **Yes** |
| `CHARTMUSEUM_PASSWORD` | Password for chartmuseum | `secret` | **Yes** |
| `SOURCE_DIR` | The local directory you wish to upload. For example, `./charts`. Defaults to the root of your repository (`.`) if not provided. | `env` | No |
| `FORCE` | Force chart upload (in case version exist in chartmuseum, upload will fail without `FORCE`). Set to `True` or ``. Don't set to any other values. | `env` | No |

This action downloads the Kotlin\xe2\x84\xa2 compiler and installs it to the path.
It won\'t touch the installed JREs.

By default, the latest released version of Kotlin is installed.
This can be overriden via the `version` flag.

It allows you to use the `kotlinc` and the `kotlin` tool to compile source code and run scripts.

> :warning: **Note:** You probably don\'t need this action.
> GitHub now pre-installs Kotlin, if this works for you, there is no need to use this action.
> See [this issue](https://github.com/fwilhe2/setup-kotlin/issues/174) for more details.
> Furthermore, you don\'t need this action if you want to build a Kotlin project using Maven/Gradle as they will download the compiler for you.
> This action is useful if you need or want to use the `kotlin`/`kotlinc`/`kotlinc-native` cli tools, if you want to install a specific version of them or if you run workflows in a container/runner where Kotlin is not preinstalled.

See [this repo](https://github.com/fwilhe2/improved-enigma) for usage examples.

## Usage example

```yaml
```

### Kotlin/Native

You can also build os-native binaries using `kotlinc-native` as in this example:

```yaml
```

## Running a script inline

If you provide a string-argument `script`, the action will execute it via [`kotlin-main-kts` script definition jar](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-script-examples/blob/master/jvm/main-kts/MainKts.md), see this example:

```yaml
```

### Using `kotlin` as a shell

 Starting with version [`1.4.30`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.4.30), you can configure `kotlin` as a shell in Actions like in this example:
```yaml
```

[![GitHub Marketplace version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/newrelic/repolinter-action.svg?label=Marketplace&logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repolinter-action) ![Release](https://github.com/newrelic/repolinter-action/workflows/Release/badge.svg?event=push) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/newrelic/repolinter-action/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=EWYZ7C6RSL)](https://codecov.io/gh/newrelic/repolinter-action) [![Language grade: JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/javascript/g/newrelic/repolinter-action.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/newrelic/repolinter-action/context:javascript)

This action runs [Repolinter](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter) on your repository. Repolinter\'s optional external dependencies (licensee, linguist, github-markup) are installed using a docker build step. Optionally you can also configure this tool to create GitHub issues with the Repolinter output.

Currently this action uses the [newrelic-forks/repolinter](https://github.com/newrelic-forks/repolinter) fork, which includes a number of changes needed for issue creation support. A [PR](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter/pull/174) to merge this fork into Repolinter is underway.

## Inputs

```yaml
```

## Outputs

| Key           | Type    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `passed`      | boolean | A boolean indicating whether or not the ruleset passed, equivalent to `LintResult#passed`.                    |
| `errored`     | boolean | A boolean indicating whether or or not any errors occurred when running repolinter-action                     |
| `json_output` | string? | The JSON-ified repolinter output from `repolinter.jsonFormatter`. Will only be present if `errored` is false. |

## Usage

### Validate master branch with the default ruleset

The following will run Repolinter with the default ruleset on every push to master, and exit with status 1 if the repository does not pass.

```yaml
```

### Validate master branch with a remote ruleset

The following will run Repolinter with a [remote ruleset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aperture-science-incorporated/.github/master/repolinter-newrelic-communityplus.json) on every push to master, and exit with status 1 if the repository does not pass.

```yaml
```

### Open an issue on validation fail

The following will run repolinter with a [remote ruleset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aperture-science-incorporated/.github/master/repolinter-newrelic-communityplus.json) on every push to master, and open a GitHub issue if the repository does not pass.

```yaml
```

### Run against another repository

The following will run repolinter with the default ruleset against [aperture-science-incorporated/companion-cube](https://github.com/aperture-science-incorporated/companion-cube) on every push to master of the current repository; if the ruleset does not pass, repolinter-action will open a GitHub issue on companion-cube. Note that a custom personal access token (`MY_TOKEN`) and PAT username (`my-token-username`) must be specified, as `GITHUB_TOKEN` [does not have write permission for repositories other than the current one](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret).

```yaml
```

## Issue Creation Behavior

If `output_type` is set to `issue`, repolinter-action will create a GitHub issue with the Repolinter output on the current repository. An example issue can be found here: https://github.com/aperture-science-incorporated/companion-cube/issues/44.

To prevent unnecessary noise, repolinter-action will first attempt to edit an existing open issue before creating a new one. This check is performed every workflow run, and can be emulated using the following [GitHub search](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github) query:
```
```
If no issues are returned by this query, repolinter-action will create a new one. If more than one issue is returned by this query, repolinter-action will edit the first issue in the list (the issue most recently created) and ignore the others.

### Consistency

As GitHub Actions can run many workflows in parallel, repolinter-action runs may happen in a different order than commits occurred. To prevent out-of-order action runs from generating issue noise, repolinter-action will first search the body of the most recently created repolinter-action issue (open or closed) for a magic string containing the [`GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/environment-variables#about-environment-variables) of the last run that updated the issue. If the run number present in the issue is greater than the local `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, repolinter-action will assume that its results are out of date and will not modify the issue. If the magic string is invalid, not present, or contains a lower run number, repolinter-action will assume its results are up to date and perform its modifications. This magic string is encoded as follows:
```md
```

This Action is not an official Postman release. As of Postman v10, Postman will now automatically create a configuration for GitHub Actions. This is the recommended approach. For more information, please follow the below link:

# Newman Action

Allows you to run Postman\'s headless collection runner, Newman, via a GitHub Action meaning no config of the Newman lib itself.

## Getting Started

This action supports multiple ways of retrieving your Postman collections/environments.

### Local files
If you\'ve exported your collection and/or environment to your repo, provide the relative path to where the file sits in your repo (default: `postman_collection.json` / `postman_environment.json`).

```
```          

### Via URL
If you\'re collection and/or environment is sitting at a URL accessible to your GitHub action, you can include that directly.

```
```

### Via Postman API
The latest version of your collection and/or environment is available through [Postman\'s API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/?version=latest). The API docs contain endpoints that will allow you to retrieve the required IDs. Passing these IDs along with your Postman API key will run Newman in this method. See [Creating and using secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for how to add your Postman API to GitHub securely.

```
```

## Example workflow file

This yml file should be located in `.github/workflows`. You can mix and match any of the above methods.

```
```

See [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for more.

## Other settings

As well as `apiKey`, `collection`, and `environment`, all other Newman settings are supported. You can find a full list [on the Newman docs](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#api-reference). This action uses the Node module under the hood, so ensure you are reading the API reference rather than the command line options. Alternatively, you can see the available options in `action.yml` in this repo.

Note that:
- GitHub Actions only supports `string`, `number` and `boolean` types. For fields that require objects/arrays, you will need to stringify them appropriately.
- `environment` and `globals` are only supported as a `string` in this Action. They cannot be passed stringified objects.
- `reporters` is only supported as a stringified object.

The following example demonstrates these notes in practice:

```
    reporters: \'[""emojitrain""]\'
    delayRequest: 5000
    envVar: \'[{ ""key"": ""url"", ""value"": ""http://localhost:3000"" }]\'
```

1. Push `develop` branch
1. Check passing all tests
1. Create a new pull request
1. Merge the branch into `master` branch

This actions is using a DockerHub image.  We must push `docker-v0.0.0` git-tag
to create a new tagged docker image.  Published a new tagged docker image, and
change tag of action.yml into `develop` branch, and check passing all tests,
and merge into `master`.

### Release

#### [haya14busa/action-bumpr](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-bumpr)

You can bump version on merging Pull Requests with specific labels (bump:major,bump:minor,bump:patch).
Pushing tag manually by yourself also work.

#### [haya14busa/action-update-semver](https://github.com/haya14busa/action-update-semver)

This action updates major/minor release tags on a tag push. e.g. Update v1 and v1.2 tag when released v1.2.3.

## Output

This step will store the JSON response from the Lambda function invocation in `outputs.response`, with the following properties:

| Property          | Type      | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `StatusCode`      | `integer` | HTTP status code - 200 if successful                                                |
| `ExecutedVersion` | `string`  | Version or alias of function that was executed                                      |
| `Payload`         | `string`  | JSON returned by the function invocation, or error object                           |
| `LogResult`       | `string`  | Base64-encoded last 4KB of execution log, if `LogType` was set to `Tail`            |
| `FunctionError`   | `string`  | If present, indicates that an error has occured, with more information in `Payload` |

Note that you will have to parse the output using the `fromJSON` [function](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#functions) before accessing individual properties.  
See the [Using Output](#Using-Output) example for more details.

<hr>

## Examples

### Basic example

This step invokes a Lambda function without regard for the invocation output:

```yaml
```

### Using output

These steps process the response payload by using step outputs:

```yaml
```

Notice the addition of the `id` field to the invocation step.  
For more information for Github Actions outputs, see their [reference](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjobs_idoutputs).

### Specifying alias/version

This step invokes a Lambda function with the `someAlias` alias:

```yaml
    Qualifier: someAlias
```

Similarly, if we wanted to invoke version 53 in particular, we would use:

```yaml
```

### Handling logs

These steps process logs returned from the invocation:

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
1125,"# Setup TFLint Action

A GitHub action that installs a Terraform linter [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) executable in the PATH.

## Inputs

### `tflint_version`

**Required** The version of TFLint which will be installed.
See [TFLint releases page](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases) for valid versions.

If version is `""latest""`, the action will get the latest version number using [Octokit](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/).

Default: `""latest""`

### `github_token`

Used to authenticate requests to the GitHub API to obtain release data from the TFLint repository. Authenticating will increase the [API rate limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting). Any valid token is supported. No permissions are required.

Default: `${{ github.server_url == \'https://github.com\' && github.token || \'\' }}`

GitHub Enterprise Server will make requests to github.com anonymously by default. To authenticate these requests, you must issue a token from github.com and pass it explicitly.

### `tflint_wrapper`

Installs a wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls to `tflint` and expose `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` outputs.

Default: `""false""`

## Outputs

The following outputs are available when the `tflint_wrapper` input is enabled:

- `stdout` - The output (stdout) produced by the tflint command.
- `stderr` - The error output (stdout) produced by the tflint command.
- `exitcode` - The exit code produced by the tflint command.

## Usage

```yaml
```

### Latest Release

```yaml
```
or specify it explicitly as
```yaml
  with:
    tflint_version: latest
```

### Using Custom GitHub Token

```yaml
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.MY_CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Loading Shared Configuration

```yaml
- uses: terraform-linters/tflint-load-config-action@v1
  with:
    source-repo: me/tflint-config
- run: tflint -f compact
```

### Wrapper

```yaml
  with:
    tflint_wrapper: true

- id: tflint
  run: tflint -f compact

- run: echo ${{ steps.tflint.outputs.stdout }}
- run: echo ${{ steps.tflint.outputs.stderr }}
- run: echo ${{ steps.tflint.outputs.exitcode }}
```

### Checks

This action supports [Problem Matchers](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/problem-matchers.md) for `--format compact`. You can see annotations in pull requests when TFLint prints issues with the `compact` format.

1126,"# GitHub Action for PHPLint

GitHub Action implementation of the PHPLint Package provided by [@Overtrue/phplint](https://github.com/overtrue/phplint). 

## Usage

Use with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

_.github/workflows/phplint.yml_

```
```

If provided, a `.phplint.yml` file in the root will be used for configuration during run of the Action.

1127,"# Close Matching Issues

A GitHub Action to close issues in the repo in which the Action executes that match a query.

## Use

Can be used to close issues or pull requests that were opened by some previous workflow after they've served their purpose.

```yaml
```

### Inputs

- `query` **required** -- [GitHub search query](https://help.github.com/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) that will match the issues that should be closed. **Note:** The search will automatically be scoped to the repository in which the Action is executing.
- `token` **required** -- Token to use to perform the search and close the issues. `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient access to do this.

1128,"# GitHub Action to run PHP_CodeSniffer of files changed in current PR or even on changed lines

This action was forked from the [tinovyatkin/action-php-codesniffer](https://github.com/tinovyatkin/action-php-codesniffer)

This action runs [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) on files changed in a Pull Request, by default annotating only lines changed by the PR author. So, it\'s fast and great to work with legacy code:

![annotations](.github/screenshot-phpcs-action.png)

Contrary to some existing solutions this actions works faster than Docker based actions (as it runs from Node.JS directly in the same VM) and runs only on changed files (good
for big projects with some non-conform files as well as to gradually introduce code style).

## Usage

Add a file like this to `.github/workflows/phpcs.yml`:

```yml
```

You also will need either to pick a build code style standard or create `phpcs.xml` file (like [this](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/phpcs.xml) for example).
You may find all available configuration options at [action.yml](action.yml) in this repository.

1130,"# Project ""Piper"" GitHub Action

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/project-piper-action)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/project-piper-action)

Continuous delivery is a method to develop software with short feedback cycles.
It is applicable to projects both for SAP Cloud Platform and SAP on-premise platforms.
SAP implements tooling for continuous delivery in [project ""Piper""](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/).

This repository contains a GitHub Action to integrate with project ""Piper"".
It allows you to use project ""Piper"" in a convinient way with GitHub Actions.
You might also manually download the [cli](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/cli/) and use it in a shell script, if the action does not what you need.

## Usage

Please refer to the [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) documentation for general information on how to use actions.

As an example, if your projects uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) you can run it like this:

```yaml
```

The key `command` needs to be replaced with the command you want to use.
The `help` command shows which commands are available.

Optionally you may use `flags` to provide command line arguments.

## Configuration

Configuration is done in `.pipeline/config.yml` in your project\'s repository.
See [here](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/configuration/) for information on configuration.

For example, if you use [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html), you might need to configure it differently based on how your project is set up.
An example might be:

```yaml
```

## Development Setup

First, add the Github npm repository for the @sap scope by making sure that your `~/.npmrc` contains the following line

```
```

Then install the dependencies and build the distributable:

```bash
```

You\'ll get a distributable file in `dest`.
Make sure the distributable is up-to-date before you push.

To try it out locally, you may use Docker:

```bash
```

For convinience those steps are wrapped into `startDevEnv.sh`.

To provide _inputs_, you may set environment variables with the right names as in this example:

```bash
```

## Limitations

This software runs on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with Linux hosts.

## Known Issues

No known issues as of now.

## How to obtain support

1131,"# go-apidiff
Check API compatibility between different revisions of a Go project

`go-apidiff` is dependent on Go\'s built-in package listing and type parsing,
and can therefore be unreliable in certain situations. For example, if you\'re
working outside of `$GOPATH` on a project that supports Go modules at the new
commit, but not the old commit, you may not get accurate results.

## GitHub Action

### Inputs

#### `base-ref`

Base reference for API compatibility comparison (default: `origin/${GITHUB_BASE_REF}`)

#### `version`

Version of go-apidiff to use (default: `latest`)

#### `compare-imports`

Compare exported API differences in the imports of the repo (default: `false`)

#### `print-compatible`

Print compatible API changes (default: `true`)

#### `repo-path`

Path to root of git repository to compare (default: current working directory)

### Outputs

#### `semver-type`

Returns the type (patch, minor, major) of the sementic version that would be required if producing a release.

### Example usage

```yaml
```

## Local Installation

To install into $GOPATH/bin, run the following:
```console
```

## Usage
```console

1132,"# rerun-actions

A GitHub Action that re-runs other Action Workflows via PR comment commands.

## How it works

Once a PR is submitted against a repo with GitHub Actions enabled, a workflow
will run. If that workflow fails, it can be rerun by `POST`-ing to the Actions API.
`rerun-actions` reruns workflows by parsing the body of a PR comment (specified by the comment's id
retrieved from an [`issue_comment` webhook event][issue_comment_wh]) for certain [commands](#comment-commands)
and rerunning jobs matching those commands.

Some notes:

- The PR either must have an `ok-to-test` label present on the PR, or the user who writes a command must
be an organization member, or repo owner, contributor, or collaborator.
  - Typically `ok-to-test` can/should only be applied by repo reviewers/approvers to prevent spam and abuse.
- `rerun-actions` should only be run on comment creation. See the below [examples](#examples) for how to do this.

## Comment commands

The following commands are supported by this action:

- `/rerun-all` - rerun all failed workflows.
- `/rerun-workflow <workflow name>` - rerun a specific failed workflow. Only one workflow name can be specified. Multiple `/rerun-workflow` commands are allowed per comment.

**Note**: Only failed workflows can be rerun due to [limitations in the Github Actions API][github_api_retest].

## Examples

```yaml
```

1133,"Setup buf for GitHub Actions
============================

This action will install the [bufbuild/buf][buf] tooling inside of your GitHub Action workflow, making it available on the `$PATH` for use in your workflow build steps.

The bufbuild teams also offers [a GitHub Actions workflow example using CMake][buf-example], if that\'s more to your liking.

## Current limitations

The buf tooling is still a work in progress.

As of `2020-06-25`, only builds for Linux and Darwin are available. For this reason, this action will fail if used with a Windows or macOS runner.

## Usage

Using the action is very simple.

1134,"# cloudflare-update-dnslink

Allows you to quickly update a Cloudflare DNSLink with a new IPFS CID. This action requires that you have already created a DNS Link record in your Cloudflare DNS settings. Additionally, you will need a Cloudflare Token with sufficient permissions to edit the DNS record.

[![CI Status](https://github.com/katyo/publish-crates/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/katyo/publish-crates/actions)

# Publish Rust crates using GitHub Actions

The action is using [`cargo metadata`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-metadata.html) with format version 
`1` to collect the information about crates and workspace.

## Features

- Reads manifests to get info about crates and dependencies
- Checks versions of external dependencies to be exists in registry
- Checks matching paths and versions of internal dependencies
- Checks that no changes happened since published release when version of internal dependency is not changed
- Skips publishing of internal dependencies which does not updated
- Publishes updated crates in right order according to dependencies
- Awaits when published crate will be available in registry before publishing crates which depends from it
- Works fine in workspaces without cyclic dependencies
- Support `{ workspace = true }` syntax in the `Cargo.toml`. [This](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2906-cargo-workspace-deduplicate.html)
  feature was stabilized in Rust 1.64.

## Unimplemented features

- Support different registries than [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

## Inputs

- `token` GitHub API token (`github.token` by default)
- `path` Sets path to crate or workspace ('.' by default)
- `args` Extra arguments for `cargo publish` command
- `registry-token` Cargo registry token (not used when `dry-run: true`)
- `dry-run` Set to `true` to bypass exec `cargo publish`
- `check-repo` Set to `false` to bypass check local packages for modifications since last published version
- `publish-delay` Optional delay in milliseconds applied after publishing each package before publishing others
- `no-verify` Set to `true` to bypass cyclic dependency detection and cargo packaging verification (uses `--no-verify`)
- `ignore-unpublished-changes` Set to `true` to exit the workflow gracefully if package does not have a new version to publish

Each local package (workspace member) potentially may be modified since last published version without
corresponding version bump. This situation is dangerous and should be prevented. In order to do it this
action uses GitHub API to get date of latest commit which modified contents by path of corresponding package.
This date compares with date of last published version of that package. When option `check-repo` set to `true`
(which is by default) this action will throw error in case when last commit date cannot be determined.
This happenned in case of detached refs (like pull requests). Usually you should never publish packages via
pull-requests so you may simply disable this action for run in such cases (via `if` expression as example).
When you want to run action (say with `dry-run` set to `true`) prevent failing you may simply set `check-repo`
to `false` too.

**NOTE**: You should avoid setting both `check-repo` and `dry-run` to `false`.

Usually you don't need to set `publish-delay` because this action check availability of previously published
packages before publishing other but in some cases it may help work around __crates.io__ inconsistency
problems.

## Usage examples

Basic usage (`Cargo.toml` sits in repository root):

```yaml
```

Advanced usage (`Cargo.toml` sits in 'packages' subdir, and you would like to skip verification and bypass real publishing):

```yaml
```

Do all checks in both push and pull requests, but only publish on push:

```yaml
```

Prevent failing when there is no new version to publish:

```yaml
          ignore-unpublished-changes: true
```

The following configuration allows you to show your latest StackOverflow activity along with your latest blog posts in the GitHub profile or project readme:

1. Follow the steps mentioned in the [how to use](#how-to-use) section.
1. Add the following section to your **README.md** file, you can give whatever title you want. Just make sure that you use `<!-- STACKOVERFLOW:START --><!-- STACKOVERFLOW:END -->` in your readme. The workflow will replace this comment with the actual StackOverflow activity:
    ```markdown
    # StackOverflow Activity
    <!-- STACKOVERFLOW:START -->
    <!-- STACKOVERFLOW:END -->
    ```
1. Create `stack-overflow-workflow.yml` in your `workflows` folder with the following contents, replace **4214976** with your StackOverflow [user ID](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/98771/what-is-my-user-id/111130#111130):
    ```yaml
    name: Latest stack overflow activity
    on:

1140,"# Issue States

Issue States is a GitHub Action that closes or reopens issues
when they are moved to a project column.

![](assets/screenshot.png)

## Supporting the Project

The continued development of Issue States is made possible
thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you\'d like to join them,
please consider contributing with
[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=issue-states&src=repo),
[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=issue-states&src=repo) or
[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=issue-states&src=repo).

## Usage

1. Create the `issue-states.yml` workflow file in the `.github/workflows`
   directory, use one of the [example workflows](#examples) to get started
2. Start adding or moving issues to the project columns declared
   in `open-issue-columns` and `closed-issue-columns`

Issues which were already in the respective columns before the action
was set up will not be processed. To process these issues,
move them to a different column, then move them back.

Care must be taken during the use of the action to not conflict
with project automation presets on GitHub.

### Inputs

The action can be configured using [input parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).

- **`open-issue-columns`**
  - Reopen issues that are moved to these project columns, value must be
    a comma separated list of project columns
  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`
- **`closed-issue-columns`**
  - Close issues that are moved to these project columns, value must be
    a comma separated list of project columns
  - Optional, defaults to `Closed, Done`
- **`log-output`**
  - Log output parameters, value must be either `true` or `false`
  - Optional, defaults to `false`

### Outputs

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- **`issues`**
  - Issues that have been either closed or reopened, value is a JSON string
    in the form of `[{""owner"": ""actions"", ""repo"": ""toolkit"", ""issue_number"": 1,
    ""state"": ""closed""}]`, value of `state` is either `open` or `closed`
  - Defaults to `\'\'`

## Examples

The following workflow will close issues when they are moved
to the `Closed` or `Done` project column.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
```

### Available input parameters

This workflow declares all the available input parameters of the action
and their default values. Any of the parameters can be omitted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          open-issue-columns: \'\'
          closed-issue-columns: \'Closed, Done\'
          log-output: false
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

## Prep Work

1. Add a comment to your the markdown file you want to update (presumably `README.md`):

```md
```
2. Add your [Wakatime API key](https://wakatime.com/settings/api-key) as a secret and name it `WAKATIME_API_KEY`.
3. Add a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` and `user` scopes as a secret and name it `GH_TOKEN`.
4. Copy the sample workflow file to `.github/workflows/` in the desired repository.
```yml
```

5. You can enable and disable feature flags based on requirements.

Your markdown file should now update at 00:15 and 12:15 UTC every day. You can change this by editing the crontab timing in the workflow file. Also, you can manually trigger an update in the \'Actions\' tab.

## Customization
If you want to change what info is displayed, you can add multiple `FLAGS` in your workflow file. By default all flags are enabled.

```yml
```

# gh_fsync ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mattgleich/gh_fsync)

\xf0\x9f\x94\x84 GitHub action to sync files across repos in GitHub

![build](https://github.com/gleich/gh_fsync/workflows/build/badge.svg)
![test](https://github.com/gleich/gh_fsync/workflows/test/badge.svg)
![lint](https://github.com/gleich/gh_fsync/workflows/lint/badge.svg)
![release](https://github.com/gleich/gh_fsync/workflows/release/badge.svg)

## \xe2\x9d\x93 What is gh_fsync

gh_fsync is a simple, configurable, and blazing fast way to sync files in your repository with files from another repository.

## \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f Configuration

First create a file in one of the following locations inside of your repository:

- `/fsync.yml`
- `/fsync.yaml`
- `/.fsync.yml`
- `/.fsync.yaml`
- `/.github/fsync.yml`
- `/.github/fsync.yml`

Now that you have your file lets go over the syntax.

### \xf0\x9f\x8c\x8d Global replace

Replace certain text for all source files listed under the files section. Below is an example:

```yaml
```

### \xf0\x9f\x93\x81 Files

List all of the files you want to sync. `path:` is the file path in your repo and `source:` is the URL on GitHub for the file. Below is an example:

```yaml
```

You can even replace values specific to a file. Below is an example:

```yaml
    replace:
      - before: project_name
        after: gh_fsync2
```

A file specific replace will override any global replace with the same `before`. So in the case shown below the replace of `project_name` for the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will override the global replace defined before. If you would like to completely ignore the global replace for that file add `ignore_global_replace: true` to the file. This is optional and an example is shown down in the examples section.

```yaml
    replace:
      - before: project_name
        after: gh_fsync2
```

### \xf0\x9f\x92\xac Commit message

Define the commit message to use when updating the files. The default commit message is `Update via sync`. Below is an example

```yaml
```

### \xe2\x9c\xa8 Example

```yaml
    replace:
      - before: project_name
        after: gh_fsync2
  - path: LICENSE.md
    source: https://github.com/gleich/go_template/blob/master/LICENSE.md
    ignore_global_replace: true
    replace:
      - before: author_name
        after: Matthew Gleich
```

### \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96 GitHub action

Use the following for the GitHub action.

```yaml
```

If you want to sync files from the `.github` folder you need to to create a personal access token with the `read` and `workflows` permissions. Then set a secret for the repo with the value being the personal access token and the name being `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Finally change your action file to the following:

```yaml
```

1145,"# Setup K3d/K3s for GitHub Actions

Install K3d/K3s and start a local Kubernetes cluster of a specific version.

**K8s** is Kubernetes.
**K3s** is a lightweight K8s distribution.
**K3d** is a wrapper to run K3s in Docker.

K3d/K3s are especially good for development and CI purposes, as it takes
only 20-30 seconds of time till the cluster is ready. For comparison,
Kind takes 1.5 minutes, Minikube takes 2 minutes till ready (as of Sep\'2020).


## Quick start

Start with the simplest way:

```yaml
```

Change versions with the verbose way:

```yaml
        with:
          version: v1.21  # E.g.: v1.21, v1.21.2, v1.21.2+k3s1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```


## Inputs

### `version`

**Required** version of Kubernetes and/or K3s -- either full or partial.

The following notations are supported:

* `v1.21.2+k3s1`
* `v1.21.2`
* `v1.21`
* `v1`
* `latest`

Defaults to `latest`.

Keep in mind that K3d dates back only to v1.16.
There are no 1.15 and older versions of K8s.
Besides, 1.16 and 1.17 are broken and will not be fixed
(see [#11](https://github.com/nolar/setup-k3d-k3s/issues/11)).

When the version is partial, the latest detected one will be used,
as found in [K3s releases](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases),
according to the basic semantical sorting (i.e. not by time of releasing).


### `k3d-tag`

A tag/version of K3d to use. Corresponds to GitHub tags at
https://github.com/rancher/k3d/releases. For example, `v5.0.0`.
`latest` is also accepted, but converted to an empty string
for the installation script.

By default (i.e. if no value is provided), the latest version is used.


### `k3d-name`

A name of the cluster to be created.

By default (i.e. if no value is provided), K3d/K3s define their own name.
Usually it is `k3d-k3s-default`.

Note: the name should not include the `k3d-` prefix, but must be used with it.
The `k3d-` prefix is enforced by K3d and cannot be disabled.


### `k3d-args`

Additional args to pass to K3d.
See `k3d cluster create --help` for available flags.


### `github-token`

A token for GitHub API, which is used to avoid rate limiting.

The API is used to fetch the releases from the K3s repository.

By default, or if it is empty, then the API is accessed anonymously,
which implies the limit of approximately 60 requests / 1 hour / 1 worker.

Usage:

```yaml
```


### `skip-creation`

Whether to return from the action as soon as possible
without the cluster creation (the cluster readiness is also skipped).
This can be useful to only install the tools for manual cluster creation,
or to parse the available versions and return them as the action\'s outputs.

By default (`false`), the cluster is created.


### `skip-readiness`

Whether to return from the action as soon as possible,
possibly providing a cluster that is only partially ready.

By default (`false`), the readiness is awaited by checking for some preselected
resources to appear (e.g., for a service account named ""default"").


## Outputs

### `k3d-version`

The specific K3d version that was detected and used. E.g. `v5.0.0`.


### `k3s-version`

The specific K3s version that was detected and used. E.g. `v1.21.2+k3s1`.


### `k8s-version`

The specific K8s version that was detected and used. E.g. `v1.21.2`.


## Examples

With the latest version of K3d/K3s/K8s:

```yaml
```

With the specific minor version of K8s, which implies the latest micro version
of K8s and the latest possible version of K3s:

```yaml
    with:
      version: v1.21
```

With the very specific version of K3s:

```yaml
    with:
      version: v1.21.2+k3s1
```

The partial versions enable the build matrices with only the essential
information in them, which in turn, makes it easier to configure GitHub
branch protection checks while the actual versions of tools are upgraded:

```yaml
```

Multiple clusters in one job are possible, as long as there is enough memory
(note: `k3d-` prefix is enforced by K3d):

```yaml
```

Custom version of K3d can be used, if needed:

```yaml
```

Custom args can be passed to K3d (and through it, to K3s & K8s):

```yaml
```

* https://github.com/nolar/kopf/actions (all ""K3s\xe2\x80\xa6"" jobs).

Deploy your [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) by GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

Cloudflare Pages\' automatic git deployments are really powerful and easy to use. However, when you\'re working in monorepo, or if you just change README.md only, it may make you uncomfortable to trigger deployment. So I automated the deployment with GitHub Action, using Cloudflare v4 API.

This action request Cloudflare Pages to build the main branch and poll the response until all steps are finished. It provides a greater experience than simply calling deploy hooks because if you just call the deploy hooks, you cannot notice whether the build fails or not.

## Inputs

- `accountId` (required): Cloudflare Account ID. See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/find-account-and-zone-ids/
- `projectName` (required): Name of the Pages project.
- `token` (required): Authorization token of Cloudflare.
- `interval` (optional): Interval (ms) for polling. Default is `3000`.

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Limitations

Cloudflare v4 API only provides to deploy default branch, `main`. So, you can\'t use other deployments like pull request previews, development branches, and others. I\'ll add an option to deploy using the deploy hooks to deploy other branches, but it still has limits to deploying pull request previews.

The `deploy-mdbook` action allows you to easily build and deploy your mdBook project to GitHub
Pages. See [`action.yml`] for configuration options.

[`action.yml`]: ./action.yml

## Example
```yaml
```

## Development

The action is written in NodeJS 12, and you can install the dependencies with:

```
```

### Running

```
```

GitHub Actions requires all the dependencies to be committed, so before
creating a commit you need to run:

```
```

The command will bundle everything in `dist/index.js`. That file will need to
be committed.

# Purge [jsDelivr][jsdelivr] cache

![Release version][badge_release_version]
[![Build Status][badge_build]][link_build]
[![License][badge_license]][link_license]

This GitHub action allows purge file cache on [jsDelivr][jsdelivr] CDN side.

## Usage

```yaml
```

### Customizing

#### Inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys:

| Name       |        Type        | Default | Required | Description                             |
|------------|:------------------:|:-------:|:--------:|-----------------------------------------|
| `url`      | `string` or `list` |         |   yes    | URLs for the cache purging              |
| `attempts` |      `number`      |    3    |    no    | Retry attempts (on the request failing) |

## Releasing

New versions releasing scenario:

- Make required changes in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) file
- Build the action distribution (`make build` or `yarn build`)
- Commit and push changes (including `dist` directory changes - this is important) into the `master` branch
- Publish new release using repo releases page (git tag should follow `vX.Y.Z` format)

Major and minor git tags (`v1` and `v1.2` if you publish `v1.2.Z` release) will be updated automatically.

## Support

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![dependencies Status](https://status.david-dm.org/gh/jcs090218/setup-emacs.svg)](https://david-dm.org/jcs090218/setup-emacs)

This is a simple action that merges these two actions \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89

- [purcell/setup-emacs](https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs)
- [jcs090218/setup-emacs-windows](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs-windows)

This allow us to use Emacs across all operating systems!

## \xf0\x9f\x94\xa8 Usage

```yaml
```

## \xe2\x9d\x93 What does it solve?

You use to have to do this to install Emacs on `Unix` and `Windows`.

```yml
```

Now you only need this,

```yml
```

![Tests](https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?event=push) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate)

**autoupdate** is a GitHub Action that auto-updates pull requests branches whenever changes land on their destination branch.

## Usage

Create a file, in your repository, at `.github/workflows/autoupdate.yaml` with the following:

```yaml
```

This will trigger on all pushes and automatically update any pull requests, if changes are pushed to their destination branch.

For more information on customising event triggers, see [Github\'s documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#push-event-push).

The following events are supported:

- push
- pull_request
- workflow_run
- workflow_dispatch
- schedule

## Configuration

The following configuration options are supported. To change any of these, simply specify it as an `env` value in your workflow file.

All configuration values, except `GITHUB_TOKEN`, are optional.

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: _autoupdate_ uses this token to perform its operations on your repository. This should generally be set to `""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""`.

  You _may_ want to override this if you want the action to run as a different user than the default actions bot.

- `DRY_RUN`: Enables \'dry run\' mode, possible values are `""true""` or `""false""` (default).

  In dry run mode, merge/update operations are logged to the console but not performed. This can be useful if you\'re testing this action or testing a particular configuration value.

- `PR_FILTER`: Controls how _autoupdate_ chooses which pull requests to operate on. Possible values are:

  - `""all""` (default): No filter, _autoupdate_ will monitor and update all pull requests.
  - `""labelled""`: Only monitor PRs with a particular label (or set of labels). Requires the `PR_LABELS` option to be defined to. If `PR_LABELS` is not defined, _autoupdate_ will not monitor any pull requests.
  - `""protected""`: Only monitor PRs that are raised against [protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches).
  - `""auto_merge""`: Only monitor PRs that have [\'auto merge\'](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request) enabled

- `PR_LABELS`: Controls which labels _autoupdate_ will look for when monitoring PRs. Only used if `PR_FILTER=""labelled""`. This can be either a single label or a comma-separated list of labels.

- `PR_READY_STATE`: Controls how _autoupdate_ monitors pull requests based on their current [draft / ready for review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) state. Possible values are:

  - `""all""`: (default): No filter, _autoupdate_ will monitor and update pull requests regardless of ready state.
  - `""ready_for_review""`: Only monitor PRs that are not currently in the draft state.
  - `""draft""`: Only monitor PRs that are currently in the draft state.

- `EXCLUDED_LABELS`: Controls which labels _autoupdate_ will ignore when evaluating otherwise-included PRs. This option works with all `PR_FILTER` options and can be either a single label or a comma-separated list of labels.

- `MERGE_MSG`: A custom message to use when creating the merge commit from the destination branch to your pull request\'s branch.

- `RETRY_COUNT`: The number of times a branch update should be attempted before _autoupdate_ gives up (default: `""5""`).

- `RETRY_SLEEP`: The amount of time (in milliseconds) that _autoupdate_ should wait between branch update attempts (default: `""300""`).

- `MERGE_CONFLICT_ACTION`: Controls how _autoupdate_ handles a merge conflict when updating a PR. Possible values are:
  - `""fail""` (default): _autoupdate_ will report a failure on each PR that has a merge conflict.
  - `""ignore""`: _autoupdate_ will silently ignore merge conflicts.

Here\'s an example workflow file with all of the above options specified:

```yaml
```

## Outputs

| Name         | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conflicted` | `true` or `false` which indicates whether merge conflicts were found or not |

Here\'s an example workflow file with the outputs above:

```yaml
```

## Examples

See [chinthakagodawita/autoupdate-test/pulls](https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/autoupdate-test/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for a repository where autoupdate is enabled. This is currently configured to only run on PRs that have the `autoupdate` tag added to them.

Here\'s a screenshot:

![An example of autoupdate running on a pull request](/docs/images/autoupdate-example.png)

## Limitations

- Branch updates events caused by this action will not trigger any subsequent workflows
  - [This is a documented limitation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#about-workflow-events) for all GH actions:
    > An action in a workflow run can\'t trigger a new workflow run. For example, if an action pushes code using the repository\'s GITHUB_TOKEN, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when push events occur.
  - There is [an open issue in the Github community forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/43427) tracking this

## Coming soon

- Rebase support
- Token support in custom merge messages

## Also see

- [automerge](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action/) for automatic merging of PRs
- [autosquash](https://github.com/tibdex/autosquash) for auto-merging with squash support

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/nerdyscout/kicad-exports/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/nerdyscout/kicad-exports)
[![default](https://github.com/nerdyscout/kicad-exports/workflows/default/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nerdyscout/kicad-exports/actions?query=workflow%3Atest)

Auto generate exports (schematics, gerbers, plots) for any KiCAD5 project.
You could run it locally or on every `git push` with Github Actions.

# usage of kicad-exports with Github Actions
```yaml
```
The [predefined configs](/config) do run a ERC and DRC in advance, if these checks fail no exports will be generated. You could [write your own config](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot/tree/v0.8.0#the-configuration-file) file and define [filters](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kibot#filtering-drcerc-errors) to ignore these errors therefore forcing to export the data. In this case be careful not to end up with some faulty PCB.

> :warning: Pushing auto generated files back to the same branch you are working on manualy is a bad idea!

# use kicad-exports local 
## Installation
You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
```
```

## run
go to your KiCad project folder and run kicad-exports
```
```

> :warning: running any command your git repository will be modified using [kicad-git-filters](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/kicad-git-filters/tree/v1.0.1)

### run with predefined example config
```
```

### run with own config
place config file in directory of your kicad project and use relative path.
```
```
or run multiple config files
```
```

### run bundle
[bundles](config/bundle) are a choice of configs run sequentially
```
```

### generates a diff of the PCB between the given and the latest commit
```
```

## running localy enables additional paramaters
- `-v, --verbose` is useful while developing own config files
- `-o, --overwrite key=value` overwrite variables in config file
- `-s, --skip $arg` skips preflight from given config file 
- `-x, --diff $commit_hash` output differential files between $commit_hash and latest commit

1156,"# ShellCheck

_GitHub action for [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)._

## Example

```yaml
```

## ShellCheck options

You can pass any supported ShellCheck option or flag with the `SHELLCHECK_OPTS` env key in the job definition.

Some examples include:

- To disable specific checks (eg: `-e SC2059 -e SC2034 -e SC1090`)
- To test against different shells (eg: `-s dash` or `-s ksh`)

example:

```yaml
```

## Ignore paths and names

You can use the `ignore_paths` and `ignore_names` input to disable specific directories and files.
These are passed as environment variables, and should evaluate to a single space-separated string.
It may be convenient to use [`>-`](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#65-line-folding) for readability if you have multiple selectors.

```text
```

example:

```yaml
```

This will skip `sample/directory/with/files/ignoreme/test.sh`, `sample/directory/with/files/ignoremetoo/test.sh` and `sample/directory/with/files/ignorable.sh`.

You can also ignore specific files using full paths or glob patterns with `ignore_paths`.

example:

```yaml
```

This will skip `sample/directory/with/files/ignorable.sh` and `sample/directory/with/files/ignoreme/test.sh`.

## Minimum severity of errors to consider (error, warning, info, style)

You can use the `severity` input to not fail until specified severity is met, for example fail only if there are errors in scripts but ignore styling, info and warnings.

example:

```yaml
```

## Run shellcheck with all paths in a single invocation

If you run into SC1090/SC1091 errors you may need to tell shellcheck to check
all files at once:

```yaml
```

This can turn into a problem if you have enough script files to overwhelm the
maximum argv length on your system.

## Run shellcheck only in a single directory

If you have multiple directories with scripts, but only want to scan
one of them, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
```

## Scan for additional files

If you need to scan for unusual files, you can use the `additional_files` key.

```yaml
```

## Change output format

Shellcheck can print output in these formats: `checkstyle`, `diff`, `gcc`, `json`, `json1`, `quiet`, `tty`. See some examples [here](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Integration#pick-the-output-format-that-makes-your-life-easier).

- `tty` has multi-line log messages
- `gcc` has single-line log messages

```yaml
```

## Run a specific version of Shellcheck

If running the latest stable version of Shellcheck is not to your liking, you can specify a concrete version of Shellcheck to be used. When specifying a custom version, please use any of the released versions listed in the [Shellcheck repository](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/tags).

```yaml
```

**GitHub Actions Version Updater** is a GitHub Action that is used to **Update All GitHub Actions** in a Repository
and create a **pull request** with the updates (if enabled).
It is an automated dependency updater similar to GitHub\'s **Dependabot** but for GitHub Actions.

### How Does It Work?

* GitHub Actions Version Updater first goes through all the **workflows**
  in a repository and **checks for updates** for each of the action used in those workflows.

* If an update is found and if that action is **not ignored** then the workflows are updated
  with the **new version** of the action being used.

* If at least one workflow file is updated then a new branch is created with the changes and pushed to GitHub. (If enabled)

* Finally, a pull request is created with the newly created branch. (If enabled)

### Supported Version Fetch Sources

- **`release-tag` (default):** Uses **specific release tag** from **the latest release** to update a GitHub Action. (e.g. `actions/checkout@v1.2.3`)

- **`release-commit-sha`:** Uses the **latest release tag commit SHA** to update a GitHub Action. (e.g. `actions/checkout@c18e2a1b1a95d0c5c63af210857e8718a479f56f`)

- **`default-branch-sha`:** Uses **default branch** (e.g: `main`, `master`) **latest commit SHA** to update a GitHub Action. (e.g. `actions/checkout@c18e2a1b1a95d0c5c63af210857e8718a479f56f`)

You can use `update_version_with` input option to select one of them. (e.g. `update_version_with: \'default-branch-sha\'`)

### Release Types

- **`all` (default):** Actions with **any** new release will be updated.
- **`major`:** Actions with only new **major** release will be updated.
- **`minor`:** Actions with only new **minor** release will be updated.
- **`patch`:** Actions with only new **patch** release will be updated.

You can use `release_types` input option to select one/all of them. (e.g. `""major, minor""`)

### Usage

We recommend running this action on a [`schedule`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)
event or a [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) event.

To integrate `GitHub Actions Version Updater` on your repository, create a `YAML`  file
inside `.github/workflows/` directory (e.g: `.github/workflows/updater.yaml`) add the following lines into the file:

```yaml
```

#### Workflow with all options

```yaml
```

### Important Note

GitHub does not allow updating workflow files inside a workflow run.
The token generated by GitHub in every workflow (`${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}`) does not have
permission to update a workflow. That\'s why you need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

**For Personal Access Token (Classic):**

You need to create a classic Personal Access Token with these scopes:

- `repo`  (To Push Changes to the Repository and Create Pull Requests)
- `workflow`  (To Update GitHub Action workflow files)

**For Fine-grained Personal Access Token:**

You need to create a Fine-grained Personal Access Token with these Repository permissions:

- `Contents: Read and write`  (To Push Changes to the Repository)
- `Workflows: Read and write`  (To Update GitHub Action workflow files)
- `Pull requests: Read and write`  (To Create Pull Requests)
- `Metadata: Read-only`  (Required by Above Permissions)

After creating the token, you need to add it to your repository actions secrets and use it in the workflow.
To know more about how to pass a secret to GitHub actions you can [Read GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

### A note about Git Large File Storage (LFS)

If your repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), you will need to manually remove the LFS-related hook files, otherwise the action
will fail because Git will not be able to create a branch because the lfs executable is not installed inside the
container used by this action.

To work around this, just remove the hook files manually as an extra step **before** this action executes:

```yaml
```

### Outputs

| Output Name | Description                             |
| ----------- |-----------------------------------------|
| `GHA_UPDATE_PR_NUMBER` | The number of the created pull request. |

#### Example Workflow

```yaml
```

### Alternative

You can also use [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot) to update your GitHub Actions.

[![Test](https://github.com/s4u/setup-maven-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/s4u/setup-maven-action/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is composite action which help to prepare GitHub Actions environment for Maven build by calling:

- [actions/checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
- [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-java-jdk)
- [actions/cache](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache)
- [stCarolas/setup-maven](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-maven)
- [s4u/maven-settings-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/maven-settings-action)

:exclamation: You **should not** include above actions in your configuration - in other case  those will be **called twice**. :exclamation:

For default values you only need:

```yml

1166,"# proof-html

proof-html is a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to validate HTML and CSS using the [Nu HTML Validator](https://github.com/validator/validator) and check links, images, and more using [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer).

## Usage

```yaml
```

See below for a [full example](#full-example).

## Options

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directory` | The directory to scan | (required) |
| `check_external_hash` | Check whether external anchors exist | true |
| `check_favicon` | Check whether favicons are valid | true |
| `check_html` | Validate HTML | true |
| `check_css` | Validate CSS | true |
| `check_opengraph` | Check images and URLs in Open Graph metadata | true |
| `ignore_empty_alt` | Allow images with empty alt tags | false |
| `ignore_missing_alt` | Allow images with missing alt tags | false |
| `allow_missing_href` | Allow anchors with missing href tags | false |
| `enforce_https` | Require that links use HTTPS | true |
| `swap_urls` | JSON-encoded map of URL rewrite rules | (empty) |
| `ignore_url` | Newline-separated list of URLs to ignore | (empty) |
| `ignore_url_re` | Newline-separated list of URL regexes to ignore | (empty) |
| `connect_timeout` | HTTP connection timeout | 30 |
| `tokens` | JSON-encoded map of domains to authorization tokens | (empty) |
| `max_concurrency` | Maximum number of concurrent requests | 50 |
| `timeout` | HTTP request timeout | 120 |
| `retries` | Number of times to retry checking links | 3 |

Most of the options correspond directly to [configuration options for
HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#configuration).

**tokens**

`tokens` is a _JSON-encoded_ map of domains to authorization tokens. So it\'s
""doubly encoded"": the workflow file is written in YAML and `tokens` is a string
(not a map!), a JSON encoding of the data. This option can be used to provide
bearer tokens to use in certain scenarios, which is useful for e.g. avoiding
rate limiting. Tokens are only sent to the specified websites. Note that
domains must not have a trailing slash. Here is an example of an encoding of
tokens:

```yaml
```

You can also see the full example below for how to pass on the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
supplied by the workflow runner.

**swap_urls**

`swap_urls` is a _JSON-encoded_ map, mapping regexes to strings. This can be
useful to strip a base path for an internal domain. For example:

```yaml
```

You can also use capture groups and back-references here. For example, to
ignore checking hashes for GitHub URLs (like
`https://github.com/anishathalye/proof-html#options`), you can use:

```yaml
```

## Full Example

This is the entire `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for a GitHub Pages /
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) site.

```yaml
```

### Real-world examples

- [missing-semester/.../links.yml](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester/blob/master/.github/workflows/links.yml)
- [dotfiles.github.com/.../build.yml](https://github.com/dotfiles/dotfiles.github.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml)

## Running locally

You can build the Docker container locally with `docker build . -t proof-html`.

The GitHub Action is set up to pass arguments as strings through environment
variables, where an argument like `ignore_url` is passed as `INPUT_IGNORE_URL`
(capitalize and prepend `INPUT_`) to the Docker container, so you will need to
do this translation yourself if you\'re running the Docker container locally.
You can mount a local directory in the Docker container with the `-v` argument
and pass the directory name as the `INPUT_DIRECTORY` argument. For example, if
you compiled a site into the `build` directory, you can run:

```bash
```

You can pass additional arguments as additional environment variables, e.g.
`-e INPUT_FORCE_HTTPS=0` or
`-e INPUT_TOKENS=\'{""https://github.com"": ""your-token-here""}\'`.

1169,"# GitHub Version Action

This action sets an environment variable to a non-developer
user-friendly description of the Maven version of the project,
inferred from the closest tag that is a direct ancestor of the current
commit whose name appears to represent a Maven version. This value can
then be used in filenames for build artifacts, etc. The name of the
environment variable which gets set defaults to `git_version`, but
this can be changed using the input `var-name`.

For example, if the closest matching tag is `v0.2.3-SNAPSHOT` or
`0.2.3-SNAPSHOT`, the environment variable will be set to
`""0.2.3-Preview""`. If the closest tag is `Version-1.0.3` or `1.0.3`,
the environment variable will be set to `1.0.3`.

Optionally you can also pass an input `tag-var-name`, which will cause
another environment variable with that name to be set to the raw git
tag name that was matched as the most recent version tag.

Optionally you can also pass an input `mvn-var-name`, which will cause
another environment variable with that name to be set to the maven
version implied by the most recent version tag (which simply removes
any leading ""v"" or ""version"" from the tag).

The environment variable(s) set by this action will be available to
subsequent steps in the same job in your workflow.

## Inputs

### `var-name`

The name of the environment variable to set. Default `git-version`.

## Outputs

There are no direct step outputs, only the environment variables
themselves.

# Installation

There are two options to run this app as part of your development workflow:

1. [Install](https://github.com/marketplace/create-issue-branch) it as an *app* for your organization/account/repository
2. Run it as an *action* in your GitHub action YAML configuration

Option 1 is easiest if you\'re developing on GitHub.com, option 2 gives you full
control how and when the app runs in your development workflow.

The App is free to use for personal, and public organization repositories. There
is [a paid plan on the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/create-issue-branch/) if you want to use it
for private organization repositories.

## Option 1. Install the GitHub App

You can install the app for your organization/account/repository from [*the GitHub
Marketplace*](https://github.com/marketplace/create-issue-branch)

## Option 2. Configure GitHub Action

Add this to your workflow YAML configuration:

```yaml
```

*The latest GitHub Marketplace release is not always up-to-date (due
to [this](https://github.community/t/automatically-publish-action-to-marketplace-on-release/17978)). To have access to
all features please use version `@main`*

### GitHub Action output variable

The GitHub Action has one output variable: `branchName`, which contains the
name of the branch that was created, or already exists in the repository. You
can use this output in downstream actions. For a trivial example see [this
workflow](https://github.com/robvanderleek/robvanderleek.github.io/blob/2af5f90d94d81e942382892a6b6149467184b38b/.github/workflows/issue-branch.yml).

## Uninstall

Uninstall the App by navigating to: `Settings > Applications > Installed GitHub Apps > Create Issue Branch > Configure`.
At the bottom of that page there\'s a button to uninstall the Create Issue Branch app.

You can also use [this link](https://github.com/settings/installations/7740930) to navigate to the configuration page
mentioned above.

# Usage

This app can support your development workflow in two ways (modes): auto and chatops.

In ""auto"" mode the typical development workflow is:

1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

*some time may pass*

2. The issue is assigned
3. When the issue is assigned this app will create a new issue branch
   (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)

In ""chatops"" mode the typical development workflow is:

1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

*some time may pass*

2. A developer that wants to work on this issue gives the ChatOps command `/cib` as a comment on the issue
3. This app will create a new issue branch
   (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)
   By default the app notifies creation is completed with a comment on the issue.

## Advanced usage with other Apps & Actions

GitHub Apps & Actions allow you to define custom and advanced automated workflows. Examples of Apps & Actions that can
be used alongside this app to compose tailored issue workflows are:

- [project-bot](https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot): App for project automation
- [github-actions-automate-projects](https://github.com/takanabe/github-actions-automate-projects): Action for project
  automation
- [auto-card-labeler](https://github.com/technote-space/auto-card-labeler): Automatically label issues/PRs

To get inspired of what is possible with Actions workflows,
see [this configuration](https://github.com/takeshape/.github/blob/4ecfb2fb54164934ad70822c709ab1917541114d/.github/workflows/_pm_issues.yml)
.

_Remember to always pick the simplest issue workflow that fits your poject_.

# Configuration

This app does not require a configuration. However, if you want to override the
default behaviour you can do so by placing a YAML file in your repository at
the location: `.github/issue-branch.yml` with the overrides.

If the app has a problem with your configuration YAML (e.g.: invalid content)
it will create an issue with the title "" Error in Create Issue Branch app
configuration"" in the repo. Subsequent runs with an invalid configuration will
not create new issues, only one stays open.

## Organization/User wide configuration

Organization/user wide configuration prevents a configuration in every
individual repo and is supported by putting the YAML file
`.github/issue-branch.yml` in a repository called `.github`. So, if your
organization/username is `acme`, the full path becomes:
`https://github.com/acme/.github/blob/main/.github/issue-branch.yml`.

Remember to give the GitHub App access to the `.github` repository, otherwise
it can\'t load the organization/user wide configuration.

Reposotory configuration files override the organization/user wide configuration
file.

## Mode: auto or chatops

The default mode is ""auto"", meaning a new issue branch is created after an issue is assigned.

You can change the mode to ""chatops"", meaning a new issue branch is created after commenting on an issue
with `/create-issue-branch` or `/cib`, by putting the following line in your `issue-branch.yml`:

```yaml
```

## Silent or chatty

By default the app comments on the issue after creating a branch.

You can change this default behaviour, and make the app silent, by putting the following line in
your `issue-branch.yml`:

```yaml
```

## Branch names

Branch names are generated from the issue, there are 3 built-in flavours or it can be customized.

The 3 built-in flavours are:

1. `tiny` => an `i` followed by the issue number, for example: `i15`
2. `short` => the word `issue` followed by the issue number, for example:
   `issue-15`
3. `full` => the word issue followed by the issue number followed by the issue title, for
   example: `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`

The default is `full`, other types can be configured in the YAML like this:

```yaml
```

or

```yaml
```

### Substitution placeholders

To customize branch names you can give `branchName` a string value where `${...}`
placeholders are substituted with fields from the GitHub issue or environment variables.

For example, if you would like to have your branch names contain only the issue number and title (similar to the GitLab
branch naming convention), configure it like this:

```yaml
```

See
[test/fixtures/issues.assigned.json](tests/test-fixtures/issues.assigned.json) for all possible placeholder names.

Substitution placeholders can also refer to environment variables in GitHub Actions. Environment variable names need to
be prefixed with a `%` character to distinguish them from GitHub issue fields.

For example, if the environment variable `SOME_VAR` is defined outside the action it can be used in a branch name like
this:

```yaml
```

### Substitution value slicing

Substitution values can be ""sliced"" with the slice operator: `[start, end]`. This operator behaves exactly like the
[JavaScript String `slice()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice)
.

For example, put this in your configuration YAML to limit issue titles to 64 characters:

```yaml
```

### Lowercase and uppercase substitutions

Substitutions for `${...}` placeholders can be lowercased by putting a `,` before the closing curly. Likewise,
substitutions can be uppercased by putting a `^` before the closing curly.

For example, issue titles can be lowercased in branch names like this:

```yaml
```

or if you want the complete title in uppercase:

```yaml
```

### Left padding with zeros

Substitutions can be left padded with zeros using the `%n` operator, where `n` is the minimum number of characters 
of the substitution result.

For example, issue numbers can be left padded with zeros like this:

```yaml
```

In the example above, if the issue number is 123, the resulting branch name will be `issue-0123`.

### Configure replacement character and replace arbitrary characters

Characters that are not allowed in Git branch names are replaced by default with an underscore (`_`) character. You can
configure a different replacement character as follows:

```yaml
```

The above configuration would generate the following branch name for issue 15 that has the title ""Fix nasty
bug"": `issue-15-Fix-nasty-bug`.

Furthermore, you also can replace arbitrary characters in the branch title:

```yaml
```

The above configuration replaces all occurences of the characters \'a\', \'b\' and \'/\' in the branch title.

## Automatically close issues after a pull request merge

This app can close issues automatically for you when a pull request for an issue branch is merged. You can enable this
feature with:

```yaml
```

Be aware that the app needs to be able to find the issue number in the branch name, otherwise this feature will not
work. This feature only works if one of the following is true for your app configuration:

- You use the default `branchName` setting
- Your `branchName` setting is `tiny`, `short` or `full`
- Your branch name starts with the issue number
- Your branch name contains the string `issue-` (case insensitive) followed by the issue number, for
  example: `Project-A-Issue-123-Rewrite_in_Clojure`

## Default source branch

You can override the source branch (by default
the [""default branch""](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch)
of the repository is used) in the configuration like this:

```yaml
```

## Source branch based on issue label

You can override the source branch based on the issue label.

For example, if you want branches for issues with the `enhancement` label to have the `dev` branch as a source, and
branches for issues with the `bug`
label to have the `staging` branch as a source, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
```

The `label` field also takes a list of label names. In that case all labels in the list must be matched by labels of the
issue. For example:

```yaml
```

In the configuration above issues with the labels `enhancement` _and_ `docs` will have the `docs` branch as a source,
while issues with an `enhancement` label _but not_ a `docs` label will have the `dev` branch as a source.

When issues have multiple labels the branch of the first match (based on the order in the configuration YAML will be
used).

If a configured branch does not exist in the repository the [default branch](#default-source-branch) is used.

## Branch name prefix based on issue label

Branch names can be prefixed based on the label of an issue.

For example, if you want branches for issues with the `enhancement` label to have the `feature/` prefix and branches for
issues with the `bug` label to have the `bugfix/` prefix, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
```

You can use `${...}` placeholders in the prefix to substitute fields from the GitHub issue assignment JSON object. For
example, if you want the GitHub login name of the user that created the issue in the branch prefix, add this to your
configuration YAML:

```yaml
```

See
[test/fixtures/issues.assigned.json](tests/test-fixtures/issues.assigned.json) for all possible placeholder names.

## Skip runs for issues based on issue label

Runs of this App/Action can be skipped based on the label of an issue.

For example, if you don\'t want to automatically create branches for issues with the
`question` label, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
```

## Matching labels with wildcards

Wildcard characters \'?\' (matches any single character) and \'&ast;\' (matches any sequence of characters, including the
empty sequence) can be used in the label field.

For example, to set the default/fallback prefix `issues/` for issues that do not have the `enhancement`  or `bug`
label, use this configuration:

```yaml
  - label: \'*\'
    prefix: issues/
```

You can use this default/fallback behaviour also to run the App/Action only for certain issue labels. For example, put
this in your configuration YAML if you want to run the App/Action only for issues with the `bug` label:

```yaml
```

*Remember to put quotes around a single asterisk (\'&ast;\') in YAML*

## Automatically open a Pull Request

Automatically open a (draft) Pull Request for the newly created branch. Enable this feature in your configuration YAML,
for draft pull requests use:

```yaml
```

and for regular pull requests use:

```yaml
```

Be aware that draft pull requests are not available in all repositories types, see
the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests)
for details.

### Pull Request target branch based on issue label

You can override the pull request target branch based on the issue label.

For example, if you want (draft) pull requests for issues with the `bug` label to have the `development` branch as a
source and have the pull request target branch set to `hotfix`, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
```

### Skip branch creation based on issue label

You can skip the creation of branches based on the issue label. This configuration option is typically used together
with the `openPR`/`openDraftPR` option to automatically create a (draft)PR between branches.

For example, to automatically open a PR to merge the `develop` branch in the `release` branch when the issue has a 
`release` label, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
branches:
  - label: release
    name: develop
    prTarget: release
    skipBranch: true
```

### Copy attributes from issue

When the App opens a new (draft) Pull Request it can also copy over the following attributes from your issue:

- Description
- Labels
- Assignee
- Projects (*only available in GitHub Action, not in the App*)
- Milestone

You can enable this behaviour per attribute in the configuration:

```yaml
```

### Skip CI workflows

Automatically opening a (draft) PR for an issue requires an empty commit on the newly created branch (this is a
requirement by GitHub). This first empty commit might trigger GitHub Actions CI workflows. You can skip these
workflows with the following configuration option:

```yaml
```

## Conventional Pull Request titles

When this option is enabled, a conventional prefix is automatically set in the
PR title based on issue & PR labels.  For example, if there\'s an issue ""Fix
nasty bug"" and accompanying branch `issue-123-Fix-nasty-bug`, where either the
issue or the PR are labeled as ""bug"", then whenever a Pull Request for the
branch is opened (automatically or manually) Create Issue Branch will prepend
"":bug: "" to the Pull Request title, for example "":bug: isssue 123 Fix nasty
bug"". If the ""semantic versioning"" (semver) style of this feature is configured
Create Issue Branch will prepend ""fix: :bug: "" to the Pull Request title, for
example ""fix: :bug: isssue 123 Fix nasty bug""

You can enable conventional Pull Request titles with the following
configuration option:

```yaml
```

Conventional PR titles can create a a clear and beautiful Git history in
GitHub. For this to work make sure to enable only ""Allow squash merging"" and
select ""Default to pull request title"" on your repository settings page:

![Pull Requests Settings](docs/pull-requests-settings.png)

## Configuring Semantic Versioning (semver) style

This option enables [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in your Git history based on
issue/PR labels (so without requiring each commit on the repository to follow
this convention.) Conventional commits make it possible to implement automated
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) of your software using tools such as
https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/.

You can configure semantic versioning (semver) style with the following
configuration option:

```yaml
```

For issues/PRs that are labeled with ""breaking change"" (or ""breaking-change"")
there will be an exclamation mark added to the title, for example: ""feat!:
Change in API"".

By default, the labels ""bug"", ""dependencies"", ""performance"", ""documentation""
and ""security"" will prepend ""fix:"" to the PR title. The label ""enhancement""
will prepend ""feat:"" to the title, and the labels ""breaking
change""/""breaking-change"" will add an exclamation mark after bug or feat.

## Gitmoji configuration

Each label mentioned above also has an accompanying [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

Labels and their emoji/gitmoji can be configured through the option `conventionalLabels`. This is the default

```yaml
```

For example, to change the gitmoji for label ""bug"":

```yaml
```

Or to add a new label type for features:

```yaml
```

## Change message in issue comments

The default message displayed in the issue comments after a branch is created (and
[silent mode](#silent-or-chatty) is not enabled) is:

```
```

You can customize this message with the `commentMessage` option in the configuration YAML. In the string value for this
option `${branchName}` is substituted with the name of the newly created branch and other `${...}` placeholders are
substituted with fields from the GitHub issue assignment JSON object.

For example, if you would like to have the original issue title in the comment, confgure it like this:

```yaml
```

See
[test/fixtures/issues.assigned.json](tests/test-fixtures/issues.assigned.json) for all possible placeholder names.

## Experimental features

The features below are experimental and may be removed some day or promoted to standard features.

### Branch name as ChatOps command argument

As discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/robvanderleek/create-issue-branch/issues/127), enabling this feature
allows you to give the branch name as an argument to the `/cib` ChatOps command. For example: `/cib Simple NPE fix` will
create a branch named `issue-1-Simple_NPE_fix`

```yaml
```

# Development

## Unit Test Coverage

#### Jest/Istanbul:

Unit Tests and coverage are implemented using Jest and Istanbul.

The snippet below shows the script which, upon execution, generates a coverage directory with coverage reports that are
then used by CodeCov to generate a dashboard (*description for CodeCov below the snippet*)

```javascript 
```

#### CodeCov

Note: CodeCov is a third-party test coverage tool which can be associated to your GitHub repository to create a
dashboard based on visual representations of test coverage. CodeCov also tracks improvements in coverage on every push
once linked. For more information: https://docs.codecov.io/docs

Used CodeCov to generate a coverage dashboard through a bash command run in the prod/dev pipelines.

The bash script can only run if:

* You have a \'codecov\' account (just log in with your GitHub account)
* The repository on your GitHub account is linked to your CodeCov account.
* You have a GitHub secret named `CODECOV_SECRET_TOKEN` which has the value of the token generated by CodeCov

Please note that once your repository is linked with your CodeCov account you will receive an authentication token
generated by CodeCov which you will have to save as `CODECOV_SECRET_TOKEN` in your GitHub secrets for this repository.
The bash script upon execution will provide a link to your CodeCov dashboard on your account.

The snippet below shows the workflow which runs the coverage command through yarn and bash script to generate a
dashboard on CodeCov.io:

```yaml
```

## Example Usage

```yaml
```

## Variables inside templates

Global Variable | Description
|---|---|
github | Access all data provided by GitHub such as payloads and commits. For example, the repository name. `{{ github.context.payload.repository.name }}`
env | Access all environment variables. For example, an environment variable called my_data. `{{ env.my_data }}`
commit | Access the data for the current commit. This will apply to ALL commits in the push event. If you do not want multiple commits see other options. Here\'s an example for commit data `{{ commit.author.name }}`

## Required options

Option | Description
|---|---|
webhook | The url for a Discord webhook. Store this as a secret otherwise you may receive unwanted spam in your discord.

## Essential options

Option | Description
|---|---|
template | The name of a premade template located into the discord-commits/templates folder.
message | The text message that appears on Discord. This would be the equivalent of typing a message.
embed | The template for each embed item. An embed item is shown for every commit message in the push event. There may be multiple commits per push. This can be prevented by enabling **last-commit-only**

## Other options
Option | Description

# Predefined templates

Here are the defaults for each template. If you want to modify the values, you need to turn the JSON into a string so it can be passed from the action environment to the script.  See main.yml for a commented out example.

## plain
Returns a message and no embeds

```
```

## plain-author
Returns embeds containing a title and description. Includes the author\'s name.

```
```

## simple-link
Returns embeds containing a title and description. The title links to the commit url

```
```

## author-with-link
Returns embeds containing a title and description. The title links to the commit url. Includes the author\'s name

```
```

## avatar-with-link
Returns embeds containing a title and description. The title links to the commit url. Includes author\'s name and GitHub avatar.

```
```

## Testing / Contributing.

We suggest everyone uses a tool like https://github.com/nektos/act to test GitHub actions locally. This is the tool I use so the directory structure will reflect that. If the following command does not pass, I will not accept your PR.

1. install act see https://github.com/nektos/act for instructions.
1. `cp .env.example .env` paste discord commit url into .env
1. make sure the following command passes.

```
```

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser.svg)](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser/releases) [![snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser/badge.svg?targetFile=package.json)](https://snyk.io/test/github/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser?targetFile=package.json)

Use this action to convert issues into a unified JSON structure. Read the [Codeless Contributions with GitHub Issue Forms](https://stefanbuck.com/blog/codeless-contributions-with-github-issue-forms) post on my blog.

## Setup

```yml
```

The text to be parsed can be set explicitly using `issue-body` input, otherwise it can be left to use the default value of `${{ github.event.issue.body }}`.

## Example

Given an issue form

```yml
```

And an issue body

```md
```

The actions output will be

```json
```

## Action outputs

- `jsonString` - The entire output
- `issueparser_<field_id>` - Access individual values


Please take a look at GitHub\'s [Good practices for mitigating script injection attacks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#good-practices-for-mitigating-script-injection-attacks) when using inline scripts. The examples blow are safe because they use intermediate environment variable as suggested by GitHub.

```yaml
```


```yaml
```

## Real-world examples

### Basic example

Ever wanted to order a pizza from a GitHub Issue? In this basic example, the order is processed and appended to the README using this Action.

[See workflow](https://github.com/stefanbuck/ristorante/blob/main/.github/workflows/order.yml)

### Awesome list

The [awesome-browser-extensions-for-github](https://github.com/stefanbuck/awesome-browser-extensions-for-github) repository is using this Action to make it super easy to submit a new extension just by filling a new GitHub Issue. The workflow runs and turns the issue into a code contribution once the label `merge` has been added.

[See workflow](https://github.com/stefanbuck/awesome-browser-extensions-for-github/blob/main/.github/workflows/handle-submission.yml)

### Advanced Issue Labeler

The [advanced-issue-labeler](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/advanced-issue-labeler) GitHub Action enables policy-based issue labeling. With the power of GitHub Issue forms and `github-issue-parser`, it provides a secure way to label issues to help with the triaging process automatically.

<!-- -->

Advanced Issue Labeler is a GitHub Action that can automatically label issues based on user input. The idea for this project came from and was first introduced in [@systemd/systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd). Systemd repository has a very active community with many issues to process. Automatic labeling helps with issue triaging.

## How does it work

Advanced Issue Labeler takes advantage of GitHub [issue forms](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-23-issues-forms-beta-for-public-repositories) (special kind of issue templates) to provide a better developer experience by labeling issues based on provided input. It is currently possible to label issues based only on [dropdowns](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema#dropdown).

Advanced Issue Labeler is expected to work in cooperation with [@stefanbuck/github-issue-parser](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser) GitHub Action. Parser action provides JSON representation of the submitted issue, where KEYs represent IDs described in the issue-form YAML configuration. Issue labeler understands it and can label issues based on selected values from dropdown. Dropdown values could directly represent labels or be mapped to policy configuration for more complex labeling requirements.

## Features

* Ability to label issues based on issue form dropdown values
* Ability to specify [policy](#policy) for mapping specific keywords to labels
* Ability to exclude certain words from the labeling process ([`block-list`](#block-list))

## Usage

### 1. Simple usecase

The following example shows how to automatically label issues based on the severity that the user describes in issue form. In issue form, there is a defined dropdown listing all severity levels:

```yml
```

> **Warning**: It\'s essential to set the correct ID in issue-form

GitHub workflow that automatically marks issues with severity labels:

```yml
```

### 2. More complex usecase

The following example shows how to automatically label issues based on animal types. In issue form, there is a defined dropdown listing all animals:

```yml
```

> **Warning**: It\'s essential to set the correct ID in issue-form

Let\'s define a policy that will allow us to map animals to their types. Policy needs to be stored in `.github/advanced-issue-labeler.yml`.

```yml
```

GitHub workflow that automatically marks issues with animal types labels:

```yml
```

## Configuration options

Action currently accepts the following options:

```yml
```

### issue-form

Issue-form parsed into `JSON` file. Supported format is generated using [@stefanbuck/github-issue-parser](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser) GitHub action.

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `required`

### template

Each issue form can have a defined different labeling policy, and this option is used to specify which policy should be used.

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `optional`

### section

The ID of the dropdown section from the issue form template.

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `required`

### block-list

List of forbidden labels. These labels won\'t be set.

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `optional`

> **Note**: _Please notice the `|` in the example above \xe2\x98\x9d\xef\xb8\x8f. That lets you effectively declare a multi-line YAML string. You can learn more about multi-line YAML syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info). This syntax is required when block-listing multiple labels._

### token

Token used to set labels

* default value: `undefined`
* requirements: `required`
* recomended value: `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Policy

It\'s possible to define a labeling policy to further customize the labeling process. The policy can be defined using `.github/advanced-issue-labeler.yml` configuration file. The structure needs to be as follows:

```yml
```

### `template` keyword

Array of issue-forms (e.g. `[\'bug-report.yml\']`). This section is used to determine the correct labeling policy when multiple policies are defined. Works in cooperation with [template option](#template).

* requirements: `optional`

### `section.id` keyword

Equivalent of [section](#section) option. An array of IDs of dropdowns. These IDs need to point to dropdowns in the issue-form template.

* requirements: `required`

### `section.block-list` keyword

Equivalent of [block-list](#block-list) option. An array of forbidden keywords. These keywords will be excluded when applying labeling policy.

* requirements: `required`

### `section.label` keyword

Section of policy describing labeling policy. `label` section of the policy is expected to have the following properties:

* `name` - Name of label
* `keys` - Array of keywords corresponding to values from `issue-form` dropdown

* requirements: `required`

## Limitations

* Currently it\'s not possible to use strings containing `,\xe2\x90\xa3` in the dropdown menu. This pattern is used in the separation process when the dropdown option `multiple` is set to `true`.

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-Rebase%20Pull%20Requests-blue)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rebase-pull-requests)

A GitHub action based on [Peter Evans' Rebase Pulls](https://github.com/peter-evans/rebase) to rebase pull requests in a repository.

## Usage

You need to create an `.yml` file, say, `rebase-pull-requests.yml`, in directory `.github/workflows` to configure the action. A typical configuration should look like following:

```yml
```

This configuration will trigger the action on every push to any branch. Let's say you have a pull request with source branch `feature/my-feature` and target branch `main`. If there is a new commit on `main` (e.g. another pull request is merged), then `feature/my-feature` will be rebased on it.

If you wish to trigger the action only for a specific branch, say, `main`, then you can use the following configuration:

```yml
```

**Notes:**
- The operation is not cascaded. If you have a chain of pull requests, say, A <- B <- C, then a commit to A will trigger a rebase for B on A and will lead to new commits to B. These commits, however, won't trigger any rebase for C on B. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#about-workflow-events) for details.
- To see the statuses of action runs, open Actions view in your repository. Note that a successful run doesn't mean the rebase operation itself is successful. Check the log and the pull requests to confirm.
- The statuses of rebase operations are also displayed as badges next to commits.
- If the rebase operation is unsuccessful, the action will add a comment to the pull request. You can check the list of files in conflict at the bottom of the page and handle them yourself.
- If you setup email notification properly, you should be able to see the statuses (including success and failure) of the rebase operations in your inbox.
- If your branch is rebased automatically and you have local commits, your attempt to push to the remote branch will be rejected. In that case, you can rebase your local commits on latest changes by executing `git pull --rebase`.

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The target GitHub repository containing the pull request. | `github.repository` (Current repository) |
| `head` | Filter pull requests by head user or head organization and branch name in the format `user:ref-name` or `organization:ref-name`. For example: `github:new-script-format` or `octocat:test-branch`. | |
| `base` | Filter pull requests by base branch name. Example: `gh-pages`. | `github.ref` (Trigger branch) |

1176,"# setup-conftest

The `artis3n/setup-conftest` action is a JavaScript action that sets up [Conftest](https://conftest.dev) in your GitHub Actions workflow by:
- Downloading a specific version of Conftest and adding it to the `PATH`
- Installing a wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls of the `conftest` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively (This can be optionally skipped if subsequent steps in the same job do not need to access the results of Conftest commands)

After you've used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Conftest commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun).
This allows most Conftest commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.

This action was inspired by and is derived from Hashicorp's [`setup-terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) GitHub Action.

# Usage

This action can be run on `ubuntu-latest` GitHub Action runners.
Future plans will add support for `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` runners as well.
When running on `windows-latest`, the shell should be set to Bash.

The default configuration installs the latest version of Conftest and installs the wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls to the `conftest` binary.

```yaml
```

A specific version of Conftest can be installed:

```yaml
    with:
      conftest_version: 0.21.0
```

The wrapper script installation can be skipped:

```yaml
    with:
      conftest_wrapper: false
```

Subsequent steps can access outputs when the wrapper script is installed:

```yaml

  - id: verify
    run: conftest verify ./

  - run: echo ${{ steps.verify.outputs.stdout }}
  - run: echo ${{ steps.verify.outputs.stderr }}
  - run: echo ${{ steps.verify.outputs.exitcode }}
```

# Inputs

The action supports the following inputs:

#### `conftest_version`

(Optional)

The version of Conftest to install.
Must be a valid semver string matching [Conftest's Releases](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest/releases).
The special value of `latest` installs the latest version of Conftest.
Defaults to `latest`.

#### `conftest_wrapper`

(Optional)

Whether to install a wrapper to wrap subsequent calls of the `conftest` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode`, respectively.
Defaults to `true`.

# Outputs

This action does not configure any outputs directly.
However, when you set the `conftest_wrapper` input to `true`, the following outputs are available for subsequent steps that call the `conftest` binary.

#### `stdout`

The STDOUT stream of the call to the `conftest` binary.

#### `stderr`

The STDERR stream of the call to the `conftest` binary.

#### `exitcode`

The exit code of the call to the `conftest` binary.

1177,"# Pull Request Workflow Cancel

Conserve resources by cancelling workflow runs for previous commits on a pull-request.
This differs from other ""workflow cancelling"" actions in that it allows you to cancel multiple workflows at once, and in that it\'s a javascript action (not a docker action), so it works on macos as well as linux, and executes extremely quickly.

Example usage:
```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
1178,"# Setup-OSS-CAD-Suite

This downloads and sets up a pre-build EDA environment from [OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build), allowing you to have all the most up-to-date tools available to you.


## Usage

The following examples show the basic usage for this action.

### Set up the latest release of the tools

This sets up the latest nightly build of the oss-cad-suite tools and adds them to your path.

```yaml
```
### Set up a specific release of the tools

This sets up a specified build of the oss-cad-suite tools and adds them to your path.

```yaml
```

**HINT:** This can be combined with the [`@actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) action to cache the download to speed up subsequent CI runs.

### Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to prevent API rate limiting

Sometimes the action will fail due to the workers IP hitting the public API rate limit. With this the action will authenticate to the API with the token to allow you to hopefully eliminate the flakiness that would occur due to this.


```yaml
```

> **Note** The action will not write to the API using the token, the only time the token is used is
> when reading the `releases` API endpoint for oss-cad-suite builds

### Use bundled python3 environment

You can override the systems python environment with the one bundled with oss-cad-suite as follows:

```yaml
```

# Example

```yaml
```

### Create a config file \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d

The default file path is `.github/labels.yml`, but you can specify a different path
see options below.

How to create a config file:

- Create a JSON or YAML file, with one of these extensions: `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.yaml`,
  `.yml`.
- Every label should be an array element: add some square brackets `[]` if you need
  to.
- Every element of the array should be an object with the following properties:
  - `name` - The name of the label.
  - `color` - The color of the label.
  - `description` - [optional] The description of the label.
  - `aliases` - [optional] An array containing the ""aliases"" of the label. If an
    existing label\'s name is an alias that label will be edited to match your config:
    this way you don\'t loose issues and PRs that have been labeled previously.

```yaml
```

> The `#` in color it\'s optional.

```jsonc
```

> The `#` in color it\'s optional.

### Create a workflow \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d

Sample basic workflow:

```yaml
```

## \xf0\x9f\x93\x8b Usage

### Sync labels to a list of repositories \xf0\x9f\x93\xa6

Specify a repository or a list of repositories

```yaml
```

> Note: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not have permissions to
> write labels on other repositories so you must specify a [Personal Access Token]
> with access to repositories.

### Get Labels of url \xf0\x9f\x94\x97

It\'s possible to get the labels of url.
If you use only url, the `actions/checkout@v3` step is not necessary

```yaml
```

### Auto Discover Repositories \xf0\x9f\x94\x8d

If you have a very large list of repositories and you want to have the same
tags in all repositories you can use the `auto-discover-repos` option.

```yaml
```

For **Features Requests**, **Q&A**, **Show & Tell** and **Discussions** please use **[our discussions page](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds/discussions)** \xf0\x9f\x9a\x91.

We have a **FAQ** category in our **[discussions page](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds/discussions)** where you can get quick answers, help with debugging weird issues, and general help.

Our extensive **documentation** can be found at **[here](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds/blob/develop/README.md)**.

### Why not GitHub Issues?

GitHub is our office, it\'s the place where our development and contributor teams do their work. We use the issue list to keep track of bugs and the features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency, to reduce replication by contributors and increase productivity.

With the discussion page, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are having. Please keep in mind that this project is open-source, support is provided by the goodwill of our wonderful community members.

<!-- @format -->

## Backlog & Contributing

Thank you for taking an interst in contributing. We have created development containers (`.devcontainer`) to allow you to jump straight in with coding. We even went through the hassle of setting up step by step guides using [CodeTour](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/codetour). Everything is configured and ready to go, all you need to do is use one of the supported platforms: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) | [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

For more information on how to contribute, please read the [contributing guidelines](docs/contributing/README.md).

Our backlog can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds/projects/1)

## Running Locally & Developing

Setting up local running is simple, however we **MUST** warn that building / packaging while using local scripts can cause your GITHUB_TOKEN to be included within the package. To avoid this happening. you **MUST** follow the steps correctly. We will not be held responsible for any leeked personal tokens.

### Prerequisities

1. Setup a secret on your repository named: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` value: `true`
2. Ensure the action has run once after you created this secret

### Developing

3. Fork & Clone the [development repository](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds)
4. Continue from step 4 of `Running Locally` then return to step 5 & 6.
5. Make changes, then rebuild using `npm run dev:run` or `yarn dev:run`
6. If uploading changes to Github
   - Delete `./context.json`, `./config`, `./lib`, `./dist`.
   - Run `yarn dev:all`.
   - Commit & push.

### Running locally

3. Fork & Clone this repository
4. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
5. From the action logs find `Context for local running` copy the output into a file named `./context.json` at the root of the project.
6. Modify the `./config.sample.json` to contain your `GITHUB_TOKEN` and rename to `./config.json`
7. Run the script using `yarn dev:run` or `npm run dev:run`

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is **Extremely** important to understand while using this template, most of the code within `.github/` will automatically update within a new pull request whenever the [template repository](https://github.com/Videndum/Universal-GitAction-Workflows) is updated.

<!-- @format -->

### Automatic setup via CLI

[coming soon]

### Manual setup

Create a new Github Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

_Note: `actions/checkout` must be run first so that the release action can find your config file._

<details>
    <summary><b>main.yml</b></summary>

```yaml
```

</details>

Now create the config file at `.github/config.json`:

<details>
    <summary><b>Our runners config</b></summary>

```json
```

</details>

Be sure that Github Actions is enabled for in your repository\'s settings. The action will now run on your issues, projects and pull requests.

### Using Regex Patterns

Many conditions use regular expressions (usually with a `pattern` parameter).
Since these regular expressions are passed in through JSON strings, there are
some things to pay attention to.

Special characters must be double escaped: `pattern: ""\\\\W+$""` is equivalent to the Regex: `/\\W+$/`.

If you want to use flags, use the following format: `pattern: ""/^wip:/i""` is equivalent to the Regex: `/^wip:/i`.

<!-- @format -->

## Available Conditions

For complex conditions, you can use conditional options such as `only`, `$and` and `$or`. They can be found within the common conditions section.

### Common Conditions

<!-- @format -->

#### \\$and

Allows conditions to be combined to create more advanced conditions. Would require all conditions to return true otherwise it would fail.

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### creatorMatches

Checks if an issue or pull request\'s creator\'s username matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### descriptionMatches

Checks if an issue or pull request\'s description matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### hasLabel

Checks if an issue or pull request has a specific label applied.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### isAbandoned

Checks if an issue or pull request is abandoned.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### isLocked

Checks if an issue or pull request is locked.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

#### isOpen

Checks if an issue or pull request is open or closed.

Example:

```json

<!-- @format -->

#### isStale

Checks if an issue or pull request is stale.

Example:

```json
```

<!-- @format -->

## FAQs

#### How can I avoid Very Good Coverage reporting an empty or non-existent coverage file?

[Relevant issue](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_coverage/issues/167)

A failure for non-existent coverage file can be resolved by setting the path input to match the location of the already generated lcov file.

```yaml
```

If your generated lcov file is empty this might be because you have no test files or your tests are not generating any coverage data.

If you wish to always bypass these warnings, we recommend using a conditional statement in your workflow to avoid running the Very Good Coverage action when the lcov file is empty or non-existent.

For example, if your non-existent or empty coverage file is meant to be located at `/coverage/lcov.info` you may do:

```yaml
```

#### Why is my input path not relative to the specified `working-directory`?

[Relevant issue](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_coverage/issues/35)

The input path must be absolute. The specified working directory is ignored by the input path. This is because it is [not possible](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/467) to access the working directory from an action. In other words, Very Good Coverage always runs from the root of your repository.

For example, if your working directory is `my_project` and your file is at `/my_project/coverage/lcov.info` you must do:

```yaml
```

\r
Conventional PR is a GitHub Action that validates all pull requests sent to a GitHub-hosted repository.\r
\r
Conventional PR aims to ease your burden in managing your GitHub-hosted repository by validating, marking, even moderating low-quality attempts of pull request just by integrating Conventional PR to your existing CI/CD workflow.\r
\r
## Features\r
\r
- \xe2\x9c\xa8 Configurable, tune Conventional PR easily to suit your needs.\r
- \xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 Sensible defaults, validates pull request with out-of-the-box sensibility while doesn\'t generate too much noise.\r
- \xe2\x99\xbf Whitelisting, validates pull request that actually matters.\r
- \xf0\x9f\x93\x88 Transparent reporting, see what Conventional PR is actually doing.\r
\r
## Usage\r
\r
> To use Conventional PR, you\'ll need to prepare a GitHub access token. Please refer to this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to generate an access token.\r
\r
You can integrate Conventional PR to your existing CI/CD workflow by using `Namchee/conventional-pr@<version>` in one of your jobs using the YAML syntax.\r
\r
Below is the example of creating a new Conventional PR workflow in your CI/CD workflow.\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
Please refer to [GitHub workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#about-yaml-syntax-for-workflows) for more advanced usage.\r
\r
> Access token is **required**. Please generate one or use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` as your access token and the `github-actions` bot will run the job for you. Do note that the `github-actions` bot has [more limited functionalities](#caveats)\r
\r
## Whitelist\r
\r
Whitelist is one of the features of `conventional-pr` that allows any pull requests that satisfies the whitelist criterion to be marked as stable regardless whether the pull request itself determined as valid by the actual validation logic or not.\r
\r
A pull request will be whitelisted and marked as valid if the pull request satisfies **one or more** enabled whitelisting criteria.\r
\r
The following are all available whitelists criteria in `conventional-pr`.\r
\r
### Pull request is still on the draft phase\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>draft</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This whitelist checks if the pull request status is `draft`. If the pull request status is `draft`, it will be marked as stable for the time being.\r
\r
Do note that once the pull request has been marked as ready for review, the workflow will re-trigger the validation flow unless by default.\r
\r
### Pull request is created by a bot\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>bot</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This whitelist checks if the pull request author is a bot account. If the author is a bot account, the pull request will be marked as valid.\r
\r
Do note that this option only recognized accounts that are officialy recognized as a GitHub bot account and not an user-automated accounts. For this usecase, please whitelist the username instead.\r
\r
### Pull request is created by an administrators\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Disabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>strict</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This whitelist checks if the pull request author has administrator privileges in the current repository. If the author has administrator privileges in the repository, the pull request will be marked as valid.\r
\r
If set to `false`, any pull requests made by repository administrators will automatically be marked as valid.\r
\r
### Pull request is created by a whitelisted user\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Disabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>ignored_users</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This whitelist checks if the pull request author username is in the list of names provided in the `ignored_users` input. If the author is in the list, the pull request will be marked as valid.\r
\r
The list of names must be provided in a comma-separated GitHub username string.\r
\r
## Validator\r
 \r
Validator is the core feature of Conventional PR. Validator will validate any pull requests that triggers the workflow according to a specified criteria.\r
\r
A pull request is considered to be valid if it satisfies **all** enabled validation flow.\r
\r
The following are all available whitelists criteria in `conventional-pr`.\r
\r
### Pull request has a valid title\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>title_pattern</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if the pull request title satisfies the regular expression provided in the `title_pattern` input.\r
\r
The regular expression must be provided in Perl syntax. Defaults to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) message structure.\r
\r
Do note that this validator only validates the pull request title and does not validate any titles in the pull request body.\r
\r
Filling the input with an empty string will disable this validator.\r
\r
### Pull request has a body\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>body</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if the pull request has a non-empty body text.\r
\r
### All commits have valid message\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Disabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>commit_pattern</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if all commits on the pull request satisfies the regular expression provided in the `commit_pattern` input. The regular expression must be provided in Perl syntax.\r
\r
Filling the input with an empty string will disabled this validator.\r
\r
### The pull request have a valid branch name\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Disabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>branch_pattern</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if the branch name of the pull request satisfies the regular expression provided in the `branch_pattern` input. The regular expression must be provided in Perl syntax.\r
\r
Filling the input with an empty string will disabled this validator.\r
\r
### Pull request links to an issue\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>issue</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if the pull request is linked one or more issues.\r
\r
Do note that linking the issue using [special keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) only works when the target branch is the default branch.\r
\r
### Pull request does not introduce too many changes\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Enabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>maximum_changes</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if the pull request introduces too many changes to the base branch. A pull request that changes more files than the predetermined value will be considered as invalid.\r
\r
Filling the input with zero will disable this validator.\r
\r
### All commits in the pull request are signed\r
\r
<table>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Default</th>\r
    <td>Disabled</td>\r
  </tr>\r
  <tr>\r
    <th>Input</th>\r
    <td><code>signed</code></td>\r
  </tr>\r
</table>\r
\r
This validator checks if all commits in the pull request is [signed commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work).\r
\r
Please refer to [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) on how signed commits work on GitHub.\r

## Supported Events\r
\r
Ideally, Conventional PR workflow should only triggered when an event related to pull requests is fired. However, Conventional PR is only able to function properly with some pull request sub-events and will ignore the rest. Below is the list of supported [GitHub Action pull request sub-events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows):\r
\r
| **Name**           | **Triggered On**                                                                           |\r
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\r
| `opened`           | When a new pull request is submitted.                                                      |\r
| `reopened`         | When a closed pull request is re-opened, either by the original author or by someone else. |\r
| `ready_for_review` | When a draft pull request is finished and transformed into normal pull request.            |\r
| `sychronize`       | When a pull request has changes on its history, such as pushing new commits to the branch. |\r
| `unlocked`         | When a pull request is unlocked.                                                           |\r
\r
> Omitting `types` is enough for generic use-cases since omitting it will cause the workflow to be triggered on\r
`opened`, `reopened`, and `synchronize` events.\r
\r
## Caveats\r
\r
- `edit` feature cannot be used with `github-actions` credentials as it [doesn\'t have the `user` scope](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token). If you want to use the `edit` feature, please generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead with `read:user` scope. `edit` **cannot** be combined with `report`.\r
- It is recommended to use a dedicated dummy account if you want to use the `edit` feature as it may lead to unintended edits.\r
\r
## Forked Repository\r
\r
Conventional PR is designed to be executed on internal environment, where only authorized users are allowed create pull request. With that design philosophy, Conventional PR is not designed to be executed on a forked repository in mind. Moreover, granting a token with write access to unauthorized user may lead to [GitHub repository access exploit via GitHub Action](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/).  However, this limitation proves to be discouraging for open source project management. As an open-source project itself, it becomes a hinderance if Conventional PR cannot be used to manage itself.\r
\r
To circumvent this issue, you must change the [event target](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target` which changes the execution context from the fork to the base repository. Below is the example of action configuration using `pull_request_target`\r
\r
```yml\r
```\r
\r
Do note that `pull_request_target` allows unsafe code to be executed from the head of the pull request that could alter your repository or steal any secrets you use in your repository. Avoid using `pull_request_event` if you need to build or run code from the pull request.\r

A GitHub action to close issues unless the user has write access to the repository.

## Example Workflow

```yml
```

**Note:** may require using a repo-scoped [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to function. (If anyone takes the time to figure out what the minimum permissions/access token setup needed is, please submit a PR!)

### Action inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `repository` | The GitHub repository containing the issue. | Current repository |
| `comment` | A comment to make on the issue before closing. | |

### Accessing issues in other repositories

You can close issues in another repository by using a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
The user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository.

1192,"# Comment Progress

[![test](https://github.com/hasura/comment-progress/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hasura/comment-progress/actions/workflows/test.yml)

GitHub Action to notify progress by commenting on GitHub issues, pull requests, and commits.

Commenting inspired by GitHub bots like [netlify](https://github.com/apps/netlify), [sonarcloud](https://github.com/apps/sonarcloud) etc.

Used at [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to relay progress of long running GitHub Action workflows on pull requests.

## Use case

When deploying preview for a pull request, the GitHub workflow starts by commenting

![review-app-start](images/review-app-start.png)

As the job progresses and if there is a failure at some step, the bot appends the updates about failure in the same comment and fails the GitHub workflow.

![review-app-fail](images/review-app-fail.png)

If the workflow succeeds, the bot comments the details of the preview environment. (configurable to be a new comment or an update to the previous comment that reported the progress)

![review-app-end](images/review-app-end.png)

## Usage

```yml
```

**Note:** The `number` and `commit-sha` fields are mutually exclusive. Only one of them should be set in a job. If both or none are present, an error will be thrown and the job will fail.

**Note**: The `append` and `recreate` fields are also mutually exclusive. If none of them are set, the job will continue in normal mode but if both are present an error will be thrown and the job will fail.

## Scenarios

- [Make a simple comment on an issue or pull request](#make-a-simple-comment-on-an-issue-or-pull-request)
- [Make a simple comment on a commit](#make-a-simple-comment-on-a-commit)
- [Make a comment and append updates to the same comment](#make-a-comment-and-append-updates-to-the-same-comment)
- [Delete older/stale comment and add a new comment](#delete-olderstale-comment-and-add-a-new-comment)
- [Delete a comment which is no longer relevant](#delete-a-comment-which-is-no-longer-relevant)

### Make a simple comment on an issue or pull request

Making a simple thank you comment via the github-actions user whenever a pull request is opened.

```yml
```

![say-thanks](images/normal-mode.png)

### Make a simple comment on a commit

This is very similar to commenting on an issue/PR. Here, instead of providing the `number` field we provide the `commit-sha` which is the SHA of the commit that we want to comment on.

```yml
```

### Make a comment and append updates to the same comment

This makes use of the `append` flag to add the message to the end of an already existing comment that was made with the same id.

```yml
```

### Delete older/stale comment and add a new comment

Take a case where you need to re-deploy a preview for your pull request and report the status of the redeployment as a new comment and at the same time delete the old comment containing stale information. `recreate` flag will help in achieving this scenario.

```yml
```

## Delete a comment which is no longer relevant

Take a case where you need to delete a comment which is no longer relevant. E.g., let\'s say we previously added a comment in a PR with `id: preview-url` to post a link where the changes of the pull request could be previewed. It might be useful to delete such a comment when the PR is closed to avoid users from accessing stale preview links. We can use the `delete` flag to achieve this.

```yml
```

# TLDR

1. Choose a name for your project, i.e. `${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}`. See [.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml](./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml) as an example.
2. Add the following to `./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: panvimdoc

   on: [push]

   jobs:
     docs:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       name: pandoc to vimdoc
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - uses: kdheepak/panvimdoc@main
           with:
             vimdoc: ${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}
         - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
           with:
             commit_message: ""Auto generate docs""
             branch: ${{ github.head_ref }}
   ```

3. `README.md` gets converted to `./doc/${VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME}.txt` and committed to the repo.

# Usage

### Using Github Actions

Create an empty doc file:

```bash
```

You don\'t actually need the file, only the `doc` folder but it is probably easiest to create a file.

Then add the following to `./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml`:

```yaml
```

The only required thing for you to do is to choose a `VIMDOC_PROJECT_NAME` appropriately.
This is usually the name of the plugin or the documentation file without the `.txt` extension. For example, the following:

```yaml
```

will output a file `doc/panvimdoc.txt` and the vim help tag for it will be `panvimdoc` using the `main` branch of the repository.

All the other options are optional.

It is recommended to pin to an exact version so you can be confident that no surprises occur for you or your users.
See <https://github.com/kdheepak/panvimdoc/releases/latest> for which version to use.
Once you pick a version, you can pin it like so:

```yaml
```

For an example of how this is used, see one of the following workflows:

- [kdheepak/panvimdoc](./.github/workflows/panvimdoc.yml): [doc/panvimdoc.txt](./doc/panvimdoc.txt)
- [kdheepak/tabline.nvim](https://github.com/kdheepak/tabline.nvim/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml): [doc/tabline.txt](https://github.com/kdheepak/tabline.nvim/blob/main/doc/tabline.txt)

<details>

```yml
```

</details>

### Using it manually

The `./panvimdoc.sh` script runs `pandoc` along with all the filters and custom output writer.

```bash
```

You will need `pandoc v3.0.0` or greater for this script to work.

# Motivation

Writing user-friendly documentation is important for every successful software project.
This is particularly true when writing documentation for users in the world of vim plugins.

The process of writing and maintaining this documentation can often be a cumbersome, time-consuming task.
This project is aims to make that process a little bit easier by allowing anyone to write documentation in markdown (or any format Pandoc supports) and converting it to vimdoc automatically.
This way, plugin authors will have to write documentation just once (for example, as part of the README of the project), and the vim documentation can be autogenerated.

## Rationale

1. **Simplicity**: Writing in Markdown is often more intuitive for developers. By converting from Markdown to vimdoc, authors can maintain the simplicity of Markdown while adhering to the vimdoc standards.
2. **Unified Documentation**: Plugin authors can write their documentation just once (such as in the project\'s README) and automatically generate vim documentation, ensuring consistency and saving time.
3. **Preserving Vim Features**: Vimdoc isn\xe2\x80\x99t just plain text; it supports syntax highlighting, tags, links, and careful formatting using whitespace. It\'s essential to preserve these features when converting to ensure the quality and usefulness of the documentation. See <https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help-writing> or [`@nanotree`\'s project](https://github.com/nanotee/vimdoc-notes) for more information.
4. **Leveraging Pandoc**: Unlike existing solutions, this project leverages Pandoc\'s wide range of features, including support for multiple Markdown flavors and easy-to-write custom filters in Lua.
5. **Interoperability**: The choice of Pandoc allows for enhanced flexibility, making it easier to extend functionality or even adapt the converter for other documentation formats in the future.

## Background

Writing documentation in Markdown and converting it to vimdoc is not a novel idea.

For example, [ibhagwan/ts-vimdoc.nvim](https://github.com/ibhagwan/ts-vimdoc.nvim) is an implementation a neovim treesitter based markdown to vimdoc converter that works fairly well.
There are no dependencies except for the Markdown treesitter parser.
It is neovim only but you can use this on github actions even for a vim plugin documentation.

There\'s also [wincent/docvim](https://github.com/wincent/docvim) which is written in Haskell.
Finally there\'s [FooSoft/md2vim](https://github.com/FooSoft/md2vim) which is written in Go.

None of these projects use Pandoc.
Pandoc Markdown supports a wide number of features: See <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html> for more information.
Most importantly, it supports a range of Markdown formats and flavors.
And, Pandoc has filters and a custom output writer that can be configured in lua.
Pandoc filters can extend the capability of Pandoc with minimal lua scripting, and these are very easy to write and maintain too.

That means, with this project, you can write your Vim documentation in Markdown, RestructuredText, AsciiDoc, etc and convert it to VimDoc, PDF, Word, HTML etc.

# Goals

By offering a specification and reference implementation for converting Pandoc Markdown to vimdoc, this project aims to reduce friction in the documentation process for vim plugin authors.

Here are the specific goals that guide this project:

- **Readability**: The Markdown files must render correctly when presented as README files on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or SourceHut.
- **Web-Friendly HTML**: If converted to HTML using Pandoc, the Markdown files must be web-friendly and render appropriately.
- **VimDoc Features**: The generated vim documentation must support essential features like links and tags.
- **Aesthetically Pleasing**: The vim documentation must not only be functional but also visually pleasing in both vim and plain text files. This includes the appropriate use of columns and spacing.
- **Guidelines**: While the format of built-in Vim documentation is a valuable reference, it is used as guidelines rather than strict rules.

# Features

This project offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to streamline the conversion process from Markdown to vimdoc:

- Automatically generates titles for vim documentation.
- Creates a table of contents to enhance navigation within the document.
- Automatically handles the generation of links and tags.
- Maintains markdown syntax for tables, ensuring proper rendering.
- Allows for manual control through raw vimdoc syntax where necessary.
- Offers the ability to include multiple Markdown files, providing flexibility in documentation structure.

# Specification

The specification is described in [panvimdoc.md](./doc/panvimdoc.md) along with examples.
The generated output is in [panvimdoc.txt](./doc/panvimdoc.txt).
The reference implementation of the Pandoc lua filter is in [panvimdoc.lua](./scripts/panvimdoc.lua).
See [panvimdoc.sh](./panvimdoc.sh) for how to use this script, or check the [Usage](#usage) section.

The following is an example `.github/workflows/main.yml` that will execute when a `push` to the `master` branch occurs.

```yaml
```

To make this work, the workflow must have the checkout action _before_ the autotag action.

This **order** is important!

```yaml
```

> If the repository is not checked out first, the autotagger cannot find the package.json file.

## Configuration

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` must be passed in. Without this, it is not possible to create a new tag. Make sure the autotag action looks like the following example:

```yaml
```

The action will automatically extract the token at runtime. **DO NOT MANUALLY ENTER YOUR TOKEN.** If you put the actual token in your workflow file, you\'ll make it accessible (in plaintext) to anyone who ever views the repository (it will be in your git history).

### Optional Configurations

There are several options to customize how the tag is created.

1. `package_root`

    By default, autotag will look for the `package.json` file in the project root. If the file is located in a subdirectory, this option can be used to point to the correct file.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        package_root: ""/path/to/subdirectory""
    ```

1. `tag_prefix`

    By default, `package.json` uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), such as `1.0.0`. A prefix can be used to add text before the tag name. For example, if `tag_prefix` is set to `v`, then the tag would be labeled as `v1.0.0`.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        tag_prefix: ""v""
    ```

1. `tag_suffix`

    Text can also be applied to the end of the tag by setting `tag_suffix`. For example, if `tag_suffix` is ` (beta)`, the tag would be `1.0.0 (beta)`. Please note this example violates semantic versioning and is merely here to illustrate how to add text to the end of a tag name if you _really_ want to.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        tag_suffix: "" (beta)""
    ```

1. `tag_message`

    This is the annotated commit message associated with the tag. By default, a
    changelog will be generated from the commits between the latest tag and the new tag (HEAD). Setting this option will override it witha custom message.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        tag_message: ""Custom message goes here.""
    ```
1. `changelog_structure`

    Provide a custom changelog format when not using `tag_message`.
    This can interpolate strings, supported strings are `{{message}}`, `{{messageHeadline}}`, `{{author}}` and `{{sha}}`.
    Defaults to `**1) {{message}}** {{author}}\
(SHA: {{sha}})\
`.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        changelog_structure: ""**{{messageHeadline}}** {{author}}\
""
    ```


1. `version`

    Explicitly set the version instead of automatically detecting from `package.json`.
    Useful for non-JavaScript projects where version may be output by a previous action.

    ```yaml
    - uses: Klemensas/action-autotag@stable
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
        version: ""${{ steps.previous_step.outputs.version }}""
    ```

## Developer Notes

If you are building an action that runs after this one, be aware this action produces several [outputs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs):

1. `tagname` will be empty if no tag was created, or it will be the value of the new tag.
1. `tagsha`: The SHA of the new tag.
1. `taguri`: The URI/URL of the new tag reference.
1. `tagmessage`: The messge applied to the tag reference (this is what shows up on the tag screen on Github).
1. `version` will be the version attribute found in the `package.json` file.

1199,"# Verify Semantic Changelog Update

This is a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that ensures your PR contains a changelog entry for all the user facing changes.
For more info check [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

This is helpful when you\'re using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) with the Conventional Commits preset.

## Example config

```yml
```

## Configuration

The action works without configuration, however you can provide options for customization.

```yml
```

## Event triggers

There are two events that can be used as triggers for this action, each with different characteristics:

1. [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target): This allows the action to be used in a fork-based workflow, where e.g. you want to accept pull requests in a public repository. In this case, the configuration from the main branch of your repository will be used for the check. This means that you need to have this configuration in the main branch for the action to run at all (e.g. it won\'t run within a PR that adds the action initially). Also if you change the configuration in a PR, the changes will not be reflected for the current PR \xe2\x80\x93 only subsequent ones after the changes are in the main branch.
2. [`pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request): This configuration uses the latest configuration that is available in the current branch. It will only work if the branch is based in the repository itself. If this configuration is used and a pull request from a fork is opened, you\'ll encounter an error as the Github token environment parameter is not available. This option is viable if all contributors have write access to the repository.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The `wtfjoke/setup-tectonic` action is a JavaScript action that sets up [Tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic) in your GitHub Actions workflow by:

- Downloading a requested version of Tectonic and adding it to the `PATH`.
- (Optionally) downloading a requested version of [Biber](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/) and adding it to the `PATH`.

# \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 Usage

This action can be run on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners.

The default configuration installs the latest version of Tectonic. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed to query the Github Releases of `tectonic-typesetting/tectonic` to download tectonic.

You can even use caching (see example below) to speed up your workflow \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89.

See [action.yml](https://github.com/WtfJoke/setup-tectonic/blob/main/action.yml) for a full description of all parameters.

```yml
```

You can also download a specific version of Tectonic

```yml
```

If you want to use biber, specify a biber version (for a full example see [below](https://github.com/WtfJoke/setup-tectonic#with-biber))

```yml
```

## Upload pdf (using `actions/upload-artifact`)

```yml
```

## With enabled cache (using `actions/cache`)

```yml
```

## With biber

```yml
```

**Note**: Tectonic has added biber support in `0.7.1` (see [changelog](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/releases/tag/tectonic%400.7.1)). Prior to that version you need to run following commands:

```yml

</br>

## Explanation

This action was created because all existing Github Actions for compiling LaTeX documents I came across are docker based actions, which are [slower than Javascript based actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions#docker-container-actions).

LaTex Docker images tend to be huge (2gb+). Tectonic images are an exception but they need to be maintained and updated with new Tectonic versions. This is not often the case, at the time of writing [my docker image](https://github.com/WtfJoke/tectonic-docker) is the only one up to date with the latest tectonic version.

In comparison, this github action doesn't need an update if a new release of tectonic is released, it just works.

The existing github actions doesn't support biber (notable exception: [birjolaxew/tectonic-biber-action](https://github.com/birjolaxew/tectonic-biber-action)).

Additionally most of the github actions tend to do too much or are too strict.

This github action has one job, to setup tectonic (and optionally biber). You can choose on your own how you want to call tectonic, how and if you want to cache your dependencies, how and if you want to upload your pdf. Depending on your decisions you can choose the best action to do the corresponding job (eg. [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) for caching, [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) or [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release) for publishing your pdf)

# \xf0\x9f\xa4\x93 How does the cache works?

The official cache action [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) has three parameters:

- `path` - A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore.
- `key` - Primary cache key - If the key has a cache-hit, it means the cache is up to date. The execution of a tool should'nt change the cache anymore.
- `restore-keys` - If there is no key hit with `key` - These will be used to restore the cache. The execution of a tool most likely will change the cache.

## Path

For tectonic the cache directories (`path`) are as follows (see also [tectonic-typesetting/tectonic#159](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/issues/159)):

| OS      | Cache-Directory                           | Run-Command to export it as environment variable                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | `~/.cache/Tectonic`                       | `echo TECTONIC_CACHE_PATH=~/.cache/Tectonic >> $GITHUB_ENV`               |
| Mac     | `~/Library/Caches/Tectonic`               | `echo TECTONIC_CACHE_PATH=~/Library/Caches/Tectonic >> $GITHUB_ENV`       |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\TectonicProject\\Tectonic` | <code>echo TECTONIC_CACHE_PATH=$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\TectonicProject\\Tectonic | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append`</code> |

## Key

By calculate the hash all .tex files (see `hashFiles('**/*.tex')`) and integrate that into the cache-`key` we can make sure, that another execution of tectonic wont change the result.

Simpler put, as long as no `.tex` files are changing, the cache wont change.

## Restore-Keys

We change our `.tex` files but still want to use a cache? `restore-keys` to the rescue :muscle:
</br>

When we change our .tex files (either by using a new package or just change the text), the exact cache `key` wont hit. Still we want to use the cache from the previous runs, as we most likely still use the same packages. So `restore keys` will use the cache from the previous run and then (at the end of the job execution) will update the existing cache with `key`.

</br>
Thats how the cache works :)

[![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/wasmerio/wapm-publish/Tests?label=Tests&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/wasmerio/wapm-publish/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

[GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) for publishing to
[WAPM](https://wapm.io). Works well with
[wasmerio/setup-wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/setup-wasmer).

## Features

- Suppresses output (Prevent leaking credentials)
- Cross platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows)
- Fully tested

## Caveats

- Requires WAPM to already be installed (Use
  [wasmerio/setup-wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/setup-wasmer))

## Usage

```yaml
```

## Input

| Name        | Required | Description                                                        |

| `username`  | \xe3\x80\xb0\xef\xb8\x8f       | WAPM account username (will be used only if token is not provided) |
| `password`  | \xe3\x80\xb0\xef\xb8\x8f       | WAPM access password (will be used only if token is not provided)  |
| `directory` | no       | Package directory (defaults to the current working directory)      |
| `registry`  | no       | The registry url (defaults to https://registry.wapm.io/)           |

## Output

Waits for a status or multiple statuses to complete or fail.

Returns on first failure, but will provide details of all states at failure. Action runs successfully regardless of result unless there is an error.

Has separate timeouts for waiting for checks to be present
and for waiting for all checks to complete. You will need to consider how long it may take for your status adding workflow 
to add it\'s state, bearing in mind that it may be queued. Alternatively you can set it pending in the same action that 
calls this action. 

To set status from a workflow see: [Sibz/github-status-action](https://github.com/Sibz/github-status-action)

## Usage

### Inputs

* `authToken` (required)  
Use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` or your own token.
* `contexts` (required)  
Semi-colon separated list of contexts (check names), i.e. `\'Test run 1;Test run 2\'`
* `timeout`  
**Default: 600 seconds**  
Maximum time in seconds to wait for an action to complete or fail  
* `notPresentTimeout`  
**Default: 300 seconds**  
Maximum time in seconds to wait for a check to appear
* `pollInterval`  
**Default: 10 seconds**  
Time in seconds between polls to GitHub for status updates
* `ref`  
**Default: `github.sha`**  
Ref or SHA to check for status on
* `owner`  
**Default: `github.repository_owner`**  
Owner/GitHub username if checking another repository
* `repository`  
**Default: `github.repository`**  
Repository name if checking another repository
#### Advanced
If you need to return `pending` state as either complete or failed, you can add it to the following:
* `completeStates`  
**Default `\'success\'`**  
Semi-colon separated list of states to consider completed successfully
* `failedStates`  
**Default: `\'failure;error\'`**  
Semi-colon separated list of states to consider failed successfully

### Outputs
* `result`  
Either `success`, `failure` or `timeout`
* `numberOfFailedChecks`  
Number of checks that were not complete when result is `failure` or `timeout`
* `failedCheckNames`  
Semi-colon separated list of check names that were not complete
* `failedCheckStates`  
Semi-colon separated list of check states that were not complete  
Will be the state of the check unless it wasn\'t present and timed out

1207,"# matrix-action

![verify](https://github.com/Numericas/matrix-action/workflows/verify/badge.svg?branch=main)

A Github Action to report the result of a workflow run to a matrix room.

![image](./assets/screenshot.png)

## Usage

### Report all build results (success, failure, cancelled) to the matrix room.

```yaml
```

### Report only failed builds

If you just want to report specific build results use the `if` directive as shown below, together with the `success()`, `failure()` and `cancelled()` function.

```yaml
        if: failure()
```

### Send a custom message with build result

You can provide a custom message via the `message` input.

```yaml
          message: Integration tests failed
        if: failure()
```


## Access Token Authentication

It is also possible to authenticate to matrix via an access token, but since this will/should expire for security reasons `user` & `password` is recommended.

```yaml
```

<p align=""center"">Add a directory to web3.storage from an Action, and output it\'s IPFS Content ID.</p>

## Example usage

```yaml
```

## Inputs

### `path_to_add`

**Required** The path the root directory of your static website or other content that you want to publish to IPFS.

### `web3_token`

**Required** API token for web3.storage

<details>
  <summary>Show advanced options: <code>wrap_with_directory</code>, <code>include_hidden</code>, <code>web3_api</code></summary>

### `wrap_with_directory`

_Default_ `false`

Should the `path_to_add` be wrapped in a diretory when creating the IPFS DAG. For most folks using this action the default of `false` is fine. 

This is the opposite of the default that web3.storage uses, as this action is commonly used to add a directory that contains a static website to IPFS. In that case you want the path_to_add to become the root cid so you can host your site at `https://<cid>.ipfs.dweb.link` rather than `https://<cid>.ipfs.dweb.link/<path_to_add>`.

If you do want to capture the `path_to_add` path itself in the IPFS DAG then you want to set `wrap_with_directory:true`.

see: https://web3.storage/docs/reference/js-client-library#parameters

### `include_hidden`

_Default_ `false`

Should hidden files prefixed with a `.` be included when found in the `path_to_add`

see: https://github.com/web3-storage/files-from-path#filesfrompath

### `web3_api`

_Default_ `https://api.web3.storage`

Useful for testing against staging deployments by setting to the api origin of your choice.

</details>

## Outputs

### `cid`

The IPFS content ID for the directory on IPFS. 
e.g. `bafkreicysg23kiwv34eg2d7qweipxwosdo2py4ldv42nbauguluen5v6am`

### `url`

The IPFS gateway URL for the directory 
e.g. `https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafkreicysg23kiwv34eg2d7qweipxwosdo2py4ldv42nbauguluen5v6am`

The `dist` folder is commited to the repo as is the curious cultural norm with JS actions, as the repo is the delivery mechanism, so to spare some cycles for the user users, all the deps are bundled into a single /dist/index.js monolith.
