[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

This is a GitHub Action which will collect logs from all running docker
containers. Logs can either be dumped to stdout, or can be written to a
folder (where you can tar them up and
[upload them as an artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)).

## Inputs

- `dest` - Destination folder to write to. If not provided, logs will be
  written to stdout. If provided, the folder will be created if it doesn\'t
  exist, and files will be written based on container names (e.g. \'redis.log\').

- `images` - A comma delimited list of image names. If provided, only output
  from containers with these images will be shown. Containers will match if
  the image matches exactly (e.g. ""mongo:3.4.22"") or if the image name matches
  without a tag (e.g. ""mongo"" will match ""mongo:3.4.22"").

- `tail` - Max number of lines to show from each container.  Defaults to ""all"".

- `shell` - Shell to execute commands.  Defaults to ""/bin/sh"".

## Usage

## Dump all logs on a failure

```yaml
```

## Dump redis and mongodb logs

```yaml
```

## Upload tarball as artifact

```yaml
```

## Dump all logs on a failure using different shell

# Docker Image Builder for GitHub Actions

This repository contains a GitHub Action to build, tag and push a Docker image based on a `Dockerfile`.

## Configuration

The inputs to the action are documented below. At least one of `tag-latest`, `tag-snapshot` or `additional-tags` must be
specified, or the action will fail. Generally, pull requests and pushes to `master` should be built with `tag-snapshot`
enabled, and release tags should be built with `tag-latest` enabled.

```yaml
```

## Notes on Docker Credentials

The action uses `docker login` in order to authenticate with a registry. Sadly none of Docker\'s credential helpers seem
to work with GitHub actions (citing a lack of X11 support for `secretservice`, and ""inappropriate ioctl for device"" when
initializing a GPG key for use with `pass`). Consequently, the login falls back to storing the credentials as base-64
encoded strings in a configuration directory with a warning emitted showing the path.

Pull requests to use a credentials helper are welcomed!

245,"# Log in to a container registry\r
Use this GitHub Action to [log in to a private container registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/). Once login is done, the next set of actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
Refer to the action metadata file for details about all the inputs: [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login/blob/master/action.yml)\r
\r
When using the docker-login action, ensure your login-server matches the fully qualified path to your image. You should omit login-server if you are pushing to the default docker hub without a host prefix, for instance, `docker push repo/image`. You'll need to specify a login-server if you are using the fully qualified path: `docker push index.docker.io/repo/image`. \r
\r
## Logging in to multiple registries\r
To log in to multiple registries, simply run this action several times with different credentials; they will accumulate.\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
## You can build and push container registry by using the following example\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
### Prerequisite\r
Get the username and password of your container registry and create secrets for them. For Azure Container registry refer to **admin [account document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account)** for username and password.\r
\r
Now add the username and password as [a secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/) in the GitHub repository.\r

Acceptable values are latest or any semantic version string like v3.5.0 Use this action in workflow to define which version of helm will be used. v2 and v3 of this action only support Helm3.

```yaml
```

> Note: When using latest version you might hit the GitHub GraphQL API hourly rate limit of 5,000. The action will then return the hardcoded default stable version (currently v3.11.1). If you rely on a certain version higher than the default, you should use that version instead of latest.

The cached helm binary path is prepended to the PATH environment variable as well as stored in the helm-path output variable.

This action will take the information from the Push/Pull Request and output some variables and write files that will let you know what was changed, removed, or added.

## Inputs

### githubRepo

_Optional_  - `string` - the github repository you want to compare changes from, defaults to the github.repository.

### githubToken

_Optional_  - `string` - specific github token, github.token is used by default (Github Action Runner)

### output

_Optional_  - `string` - type of output for output variables, default is json.  Use ',' for comma separated values, or ' ' for space delimited values.  You can also create your own delimiter for example ' |FILE:' will output 'file1.yml |FILE:file2.yml |FILE:file3.yml'.

### fileOutput

_Optional_  - `string` - type of output for file output, default is json.  Use ',' for comma separated values, or ' ' for space delimited values.  You can also create your own delimiter for example `\\ |FILE:` will output:

> file1.yml |FILE:file2.yml |FILE:file3.yml  

If you select json then the file format will be .json, if you select ',' then the file format will be .csv, anything else will output the files as .txt

### pushBefore

_Optional_  - `string` - pass in a specific sha to compare to as a before, required if using pushAfter. (push payload after github.payload.before)

### pushAfter

_Optional_  - `string` - pass in a specific sha to compare to as an after, required if using pushBefore. (push payload after github.payload.after)

### prNumber

_Optional_  - `string` - pass in a specific PR number to get file changes from.

## Outputs

### files

steps.file_changes.outputs.files - `string` - The names all new, updated, and removed files.  The output is dependant on the output input, default is a json string.

### files_added

steps.file_changes.outputs.files_added - `string` - The names of the newly created files.  The output is dependant on the output input, default is a json string.

### files_modified

steps.file_changes.outputs.files_modified - `string` - The names of the updated files.  The output is dependant on the output input, default is a json string.

### files_removed

steps.file_changes.outputs.files_removed - `string` - The names of the removed files.  The output is dependant on the output input, default is a json string.

## Example usage

```yaml
```

## How to Use

In order to make those decisions we need to know what files have changed and that is where this action comes in.  In the example below we are checking out our repository code, and then running the `trilom/file-changes-action@v1` action.  The only thing you need to provide is a GITHUB_TOKEN so that Octokit can make it's API calls.

If a PR is made then it will look at all of the files included in the PR.
If a push is made then it will compare commits from the SHA `github.payload.before` to the SHA `github.payload.after` of the push.

After gathering this information it will output the files in 2 ways.  
  
- As an output variable, you can use this variable by using `steps.file_changes_outputs_files`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_modified`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_added`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_removed`.

- As a file on the container stored at `$HOME/files.json`, `$HOME/files_modified.json`, `$HOME/files_added.json`, `$HOME/files_removed.json`.  

- _NOTE:_ If you set a custom delimiter in output or fileOutput inputs then you will receive different files.  For example a delimiter of ',' will output at `$HOME/files.csv` instead of `$HOME/files.json`.  Likewise, anything other than 'json' or ',' delmiters will output `$HOME/files.txt` files instead of `$HOME/files.json` by default.

## Use Cases

I have a process where I have AWS Cloudformation templates stored in one directory that might be named PRODUCT-ROLE, and mappings for these templates that span the PRODUCT.  For example **mappings/wordpress.mappings.yml, templates/wordpress-database.yml, templates/wordpress-webserver.yml**, and some of the templates might use different Lambda functions defined in for example **functions/wordpress-webserver/**.

In the example below we have a workflow that on *push* to the develop branch we can perform some actions based on the files.  In my use case I look for changes on the develop branch of this repository for every push that happens.  When a push happens and a change is made to any of the paths below the workflow will trigger.  With this action you are able to know exactly which files changed so that you can make decisions later in your CI/CD.

In this case, if a **templates/*.yml** file is changed, then we want to update the Cloudformation stack.  We can also write specifics for related templates.  For example, if **templates/wordpress-database.yml** changes then we want to deploy **templates/wordpress-webserver.yml** as well after.

Another case is if the **mappings/wordpress.mappings.yml** changes, we want to deploy all **template/wordpress-*.yml** files.

## More examples  

```yaml
```

You can set the output and fileOutput to ',' for csv output.

```yaml
```

You can set the output and fileOutput to ' ' for txt output.  We also used a specific token, and got info for the PR that this push came from.

### using this action

To use this action, add it adjacent to `setup-python` and opt into it
conditionally.  Here\'s an example which uses `python-version` as a matrix.

```yaml
```

### available versions

- to use nightly builds, add `-dev` to the end of the version name.
    - [available nightly versions]
- to use tagged builds, just use the version number
    - [available versions]

In either case, the actions\'s `debug` input can be used to install a
debug build of the selected Python version, by adding `debug: true`.

[![Deploy](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/actions)

## What does this action do?

This action runs [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize).

## Usage

Define a workflow in `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml` (or add a job if you already have defined workflows).

:bulb: Read more about [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow).

### Default Behaviour

By default this action will run

```
```

in the working directory.

When you use this action in a step with the default behaviour, the step will fail when

- `composer.json` does not exist in this directory (be sure to checkout the code first, see [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))
- `composer.json` is not valid
- `composer.json` is valid, but `composer.lock` is not up-to-date with `composer.json`

and the step will succeed when

- `composer.json` is valid, `composer.lock` is not present, and `composer.json` and not yet normalized or could be successfully normalized
- `composer.json` is valid, `composer.lock` is present and up-to-date, and `composer.json`, and `composer.json` and not yet normalized or could be successfully normalized

:bulb: If you want the step to fail when `composer.json` is not yet normalized, you need to run with the `--dry-run` options, see below.

Here\'s an example for a workflow configuration with the default behaviour:

```yaml
```

### Custom Behavior

If you prefer to specify [arguments](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/tree/main#arguments) or [options](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/main#options) yourself, you can configure those using the `args` option:

```diff
```

### Docker image

As Docker images are automatically built and pushed on a merge to `main` or when a new tag is created in this repository, the recommended way to use this GitHub action is to reference the pre-built Docker image directly, as seen above.

:bulb: The Docker image can also be executed directly by running

```
```

For more information, see the [Docker Docs: Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

Instead of using the latest pre-built Docker image, you can also specify a Docker image tag (which corresponds to the tags [released on GitHub](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/releases)):

```diff
```

# Setup MSYS2

**setup-msys2** is a GitHub Action (GHA) to setup an [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment (i.e. MSYS,
MINGW32, MINGW64, UCRT64, CLANG32, CLANG64 and/or CLANGARM64 shells)

It provides:

* Easy installation and updates
* Easy package installation including caching for faster re-runs
* A shell helper for running your commands or your whole job in an MSYS2 environment

## Usage

```yaml
```

Then, for scripts:

```yaml
```

It is also possible to execute specific commands from cmd/powershell scripts/snippets.
In order to do so, `-c` is required:

```yaml
```

```yaml
```

### Default shell

In order to reduce verbosity, it is possible to set `msys2` as the default shell. For example:

```yaml
  defaults:
    run:
      shell: msys2 {0}
  steps:
    with:
      update: true
      install: >-
        curl
        git
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

### Build matrix

It is common to test some package/tool on multiple environments, which typically requires installing different sets of
packages through option `install`.
GitHub Actions\' `strategy` and `matrix` fields allow to do so, as explained in [docs.github.com: Configuring a build matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix)
and [docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix).
See, for instance:

```yml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - { sys: mingw64, env: x86_64 }
        - { sys: mingw32, env: i686 }
        - { sys: ucrt64,  env: ucrt-x86_64 }
        - { sys: clang64, env: clang-x86_64 }
  steps:
        with:
        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
        install: mingw-w64-${{matrix.env}}-openssl
```

Alternatively, option `pacboy` allows using a single matrix variable:

```yml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      sys:
        - mingw64
        - mingw32
        - ucrt64
        - clang64
  steps:
        with:
        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
        pacboy: openssl:p
```

Furthermore, [.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml](.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml) is a [Reusable Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)
to build and test a package in GitHub Actions using a PKGBUILD recipe.
It can be used along with [matrix](./matrix) (a [Composite Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)),
as shown in [.github/workflows/Tool.yml](.github/workflows/Tool.yml).

Note: By default, GitHub Actions terminates any running jobs if any job in matrix
fails. This default behavior can be disabled by setting `fail-fast: false` in
strategy section. See
[docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategyfail-fast)
for more details.

- [examples/cmake.yml](examples/cmake.yml)
- [msys2/MINGW-packages: .github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)

Find further details at [#171](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/171#issuecomment-961458598) and [#102](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/102).

### Options

#### msystem

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `MSYS | MINGW64 | MINGW32 | UCRT64 | CLANG32 | CLANG64 | CLANGARM64`
* Default: `MINGW64`

The default [environment](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) that is used in the `msys2` command/shell provided by this action.

MSYS2 recommends `UCRT64` nowadays as the default instead of `MINGW64`.

For example:

```yaml
    with:
      msystem: UCRT64
```

The environment can be later overridden using the `MSYSTEM` environment variable if needed.
This is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts.
For example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:

```yaml
    with:
      msystem: MSYS
  - shell: msys2 {0}
    run: |
      makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar
      pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz
  - run: |
      set MSYSTEM=UCRT64
      msys2 -c \'<command to test the package>\'
```

#### update

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `false`

By default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball.
By setting option `update` to `true`, the action will update the package database and all already installed packages.

```yaml
    with:
      update: true
```

#### install

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: a whitespace separated list of packages
* Default: -

Installing additional packages after updating the system is supported through option `install`.
The package or list of packages are installed through `pacman --noconfirm -S --needed --overwrite *`.

```yaml
    with:
      update: true
      install: >-
        git
        curl
```

#### pacboy

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: s whitespace separated list of packages
* Default: -

Installing additional packages with [pacboy](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/#avoiding-writing-long-package-names) after updating the system is supported through option `pacboy`.
The package or list of packages are installed through `pacboy --noconfirm -S --needed`.

```yaml
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix:
      sys: [ MINGW64, MINGW32, UCRT64, CLANG64 ]
  steps:
    with:
      msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}
      install: >-
        git
        curl
      pacboy: >-
        openssl:p
```

#### platform-check-severity

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `warn | fatal`
* Default: `warn`

By default (`fatal`), throw an error if the runner OS is not Windows.
If set to `warn`, simply log a message and skip the rest:

```yaml
    with:
      platform-check-severity: warn
```

### Advanced Options

These options are rarely needed and shouldn\'t be used unless there is a good reason.

#### path-type

* Type: `string`
* Allowed values: `minimal | strict | inherit`
* Default: `minimal`

Defines which parts of the Windows `$env:PATH` environment variable leak into the MSYS2 environment.
Allowed values:

- `strict`: do not inherit anything from `$env:PATH`.
- `minimal` *(default)*: only inherit the default Windows paths from `$env:PATH` (so that `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`
  are available for example).
- `inherit`: inherit everything; warning: this can lead to interference with other tools installed on the system.

```yaml
    with:
      path-type: minimal
```

This option corresponds to the `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE` setting in MSYS2; hence it can be overridden per step through `env`.
See [msys2/MSYS2-packages: filesystem/profile](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/blob/915946a637e1f2b7e26e32782f3af322009293db/filesystem/profile#L28-L45)
for further details about the configuration of each option.

#### cache

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

By default (`true`), caches various things between runs to make repeated runs faster.

```yaml
    with:
      cache: false
```

#### location

* Type: `string`
* Default: -

Specify an alternate location where to install MSYS2 to.

```yaml
    with:
      location: D:\\
```

#### release

* Type: `boolean`
* Default: `true`

If `true` (the default) it makes a fresh install of the latest MSYS2 installer release.
If `false` it will try to re-use the [existing MSYS2 installation](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#msys2) which is part of the official [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).

```yaml
    with:
      release: false
```

## Known Problems

### actions/checkout and line endings

In case you use the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action in your workflow and haven\'t configured git attributes for line endings, then git might auto convert your text files in the git repo to Windows line endings, which might lead to problems with tools provided by MSYS2.

To work around this issue disable the auto conversion before running `actions/checkout`:

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
251,"# Get Version Action

A GitHub Action which extracts the version from `github.ref`.

Finally, you can reliably get the pushed version on every platform. Now includes support for semver!

## Outputs

### `version`

The pushed version. If `github.ref` was `refs/tags/v1.2.7` or `refs/heads/release/v1.2.7` then the value of this output will be `v1.2.7`.

### `version-without-v`

The pushed version with the leading `v` stripped. If `github.ref` was `refs/tags/v1.2.7` then the value of this output will be `1.2.7`.

If the version does not start with a leading `v` character, then the value of this output is the same as that of `version`.

### `is-semver`

Set to `true` if the pushed version is a valid [semver](https://semver.org/) value. If it's not, then this output will not be set.

### `major`

The semver major version, for example `1` in the case of `v1.2.3-ALPHA.0+BUILD.1`.

### `minor`

The semver minor version, for example `2` in the case of `v1.2.3-ALPHA.0+BUILD.1`.

### `patch`

The semver patch version, for example `3` in the case of `v1.2.3-ALPHA.0+BUILD.1`.

### `prerelease`

The semver prerelease version, for example `ALPHA.0` in the case of `v1.2.3-ALPHA.0+BUILD.1`.

### `build`

The semver build version, for example `BUILD.1` in the case of `v1.2.3-ALPHA.0+BUILD.1`.

252,"# Verify Pull Request Label Action

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/162d73a2aff6478081cdc34ee9ee7b6e)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

## Description

This action will verify if a pull request has at least one label from a set of valid labels, as well as no label from a set of invalid labels. The sets of valid and invalid labels are defined by the user and passed as input arguments.

To prevent the merging of an invalid pull request, this action uses either the standard pull request workflow or the status of the GitHub Action check.

### Using the standard pull request workflow

By default, this action uses the standard pull request workflow. In this mode, if the pull request does not contain a label from the set of valid labels, or contains a label from the set of invalid labels, then the action will create a pull request review using the event `REQUEST_CHANGES`; independent reviews are generated for both cases. Otherwise, the action will instead create a pull request review using the event `APPROVE`. In both of these cases the exit code will be `0`, and the GitHub Action check will always succeed.

The `REQUEST_CHANGES` review will prevent the merging of the pull request (if the option `Require pull request reviews before merging` is enabled in the repository) until the `APPROVE` review is generated. After that, the pull request can be merged.

When this action runs, it will look for the previous review done by itself, and it will not repeat the same request again. However, if the option `Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed` is enabled in the repository, previous review will be automatically dismissed and therefore this check will fail, and a new request will always be generated.

**Note**: if you want to use the `Require pull request reviews before merging` to require reviews approval before merging pull requests, then you need to increase the number of `Required approving reviewers` by one, as this check will do an approval when a valid label is present. So, for example, if you want at least one reviewer approval, then set this value to 2.

### Using the GitHub Action check status

On the other hand, the creations of reviews can be disabled by setting the input `disable-reviews` to `true`. In this mode, if the pull request does not contain a label from the set of valid labels, or contains a label from the set of invalid labels, then the action will exit with an error code (`1`), and the GitHub Action check will fail. Otherwise, the action will instead exit with the code `0`, and the GitHub Action check will succeed. In both cases, the action won't create any pull request review.

The failing of the GitHub Action check will prevent the merging of the pull request (if the option `Require status checks to pass before merging` is enabled in the repository) until the check succeeds. After that, the pull request can be merged.

## Note when working with forks

When a pull request is opened from a forked repository, Github actions run with read-only permissions, and so the action won't be able to create a pull request review.

Fortunately, Github recently added a new trigger event `pull_request_target` which behaves in an almost identical way to the `pull_request` event, but the action runs in the base of the pull request and will therefore have write permission. However, as the action runs in the base of the pull request, the pull request number is not available in the environmental variables, and must therefore be passed as an input argument. Please refer to the example usage section for more details.

## Inputs

### `github-token`

**Required** The GitHub token.

### `valid-labels`

**Required** A list of valid labels. It must be a quoted string, with label separated by commas. For example: `'bug, enhancement'`

### `invalid-labels`

**Optional** A list of invalid labels. It must be a quoted string, with label separated by commas. For example: `'help wanted, invalid'`.

### `pull-request-number`

Depending on the trigger condition used, this input is:
*   **Required** when the action is triggered using `pull_request_target`. It is available in the github context as: `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`. Or,
*   **Optional** when the action is triggered using `pull_request`. In this case this number is is automatically extracted from the environmental variables.

### `disable-reviews`

**Optional** Set to `true` to disable the creation on pull request reviews, and use the status of the check instead.

## Example usage

Normally, in your project you would want to allow PRs both from the same repository as well as forks. In that case, you must use the trigger condition `pull_request_target`, as described in this example:

In your workflow YAML file add these steps:
```yaml
```

and trigger it with:
```yaml
```

The above example should you preferred method. Nevertheless, the trigger condition `pull_request` is also supported, and you can use it instead of `pull_request_target`. This condition, however, works only for PRs from the same repository; its only advantage is that the `pull-request-number` input is not needed in this case and can be omitted. So, if you want to use that condition instead, follow this example:

In your workflow YAML file add this step:
```yaml
```

and trigger it with:
```yaml
```

Please note that you must use only **one** trigger condition for your action, either `pull_request_target` or `pull_request`, but not both at the same time.

253,"# github-action-required-labels

This action allows you to fail the build if/unless a certain combination of labels are applied to a pull request.

## Usage

This action has three required inputs; `labels`, `mode` and `count`

| Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Required | Default             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| `labels`      | Comma or new line separated list of labels to match                                                                                                          | true     |
| `mode`        | The mode of comparison to use. One of: exactly, minimum, maximum                                                                                             | true     |
| `count`       | The required number of labels to match                                                                                                                       | true     |
| `token`       | The GitHub token to use when calling the API                                                                                                                 | false    | ${{ github.token }} |
| `message`     | The message to log and to add to the PR (if add_comment is true). See the README for available placeholders                                                  | false    |
| `add_comment` | Add a comment to the PR if required labels are missing. If a comment already exists, it will be updated. When the action passes, the comment will be deleted | false    | false               |
| `exit_type`   | The exit type of the action. One of: failure, success                                                                                                        | false    |

This action calls the GitHub API to fetch labels for a PR rather than reading `event.json`. This allows the action to run as intended when an earlier step adds a label. It will use `github.token` by default, and you can set the `token` input to provide alternative authentication.

If successful, any matching labels will be output in `outputs.labels` as a comma separated string.

## Examples

### Complete example

```yaml
```

### Prevent merging if a label exists

```yaml
```

### Post a comment when the check fails

You can choose to add a comment to the PR when the action fails. The default format is:

> Label error. Requires {{ errorString }} {{ count }} of: {{ provided }}. Found: {{ applied }}

```yaml
```

If a comment already exists, it will be updated. When the action passes, the comment will be deleted.

### Customising the failure message / comment

You can also customise the message used by providing the `message` input:

```yaml
    message: ""This PR is being prevented from merging because you have added one of our blocking labels: {{ provided }}. You\'ll need to remove it before this PR can be merged.""
```

The following tokens are available for use in custom messages:

| Token       | Value                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| mode        | One of: `exactly`, `minimum`, `maximum`  |
| count       | The value of the `count` input           |
| errorString | One of: `exactly`, `at least`, `at most` |
| provided    | The value of the `labels` input          |
| applied     | The labels that are applied to the PR    |

### Require multiple labels

```yaml
```

### Preventing comment collisions

This action uses a combination of the workflow name/path, job ID, and step ID to add an invisible ""match token"" to the beginning of any comments it creates. That way, it can later know which comments it owns when modifying them, while supporting multiple ""instances"" of this action to be run at the same time within a repo.

However, note that if any of those three identifiers change, any ""in flight"" comments on open PRs may be orphaned (since the final match token will have changed between runs). If you rename any of those identifiers, you will have to delete any orphaned comments manually.

### Controlling failure

You can set `exit_type` to success then inspect `outputs.status` to see if the action passed or failed. This is useful when you want to perform additional actions if a label is not present, but not fail the entire build.

```yaml
    exit_type: success # Can be: success or failure (default: failure)
```

If the action passed, `outputs.status` will be `success`. If it failed, `outputs.status` will be `failure`.

Here is a complete workflow example for this use case:

```yaml
```

### Using Output Labels

If the action was successful you can access the matching labels via `outputs.labels`. This is useful if you want to use the labels in a later step.

```yaml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
254,"# [GitHub Action] Flarum JavaScript Building

A GitHub Action to automatically compile your Flarum extension's Javascript code, and push it to your GitHub repository.

You could set this action up to run whenever a commit is pushed to your main Git branch in order to automate part of your development process.

We use this action extensively within Flarum, including for `core` and all our bundled extensions.

## Example Workflow

```yml
```

## Options

Here is a full list of options available using the `with` syntax:

| Name                   | Required | Description                                                                                                             | Example                       | Default |
|------------------------| -------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------| ------- |
| `github_token`         | Yes      | Your Actions GitHub token. The example value should work for this by default.                                           | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` | None    |
| `build_script`         | Yes      | The `package.json` script to run to build your extension JS.                                                            | `build`                       | `build` |
| `build_typings_script` | No       | If defined, runs the script of this name in `package.json` to build typings for your extension.                         | `build-typings`               | Unset   |
| `format_script`        | No       | If defined, runs the script of this name in `package.json` to check code formatting of your extension's JS.             | `format-check`                | Unset   |
| `check_typings_script` | No       | If defined, runs the script of this name in `package.json` to typecheck your extension's TypeScript code.               | `check-typings`               | Unset   |
| `type_coverage_script` | No       | If defined, runs the script of this name in `package.json` to assess type coverage in your extension's TypeScript code. | `check-typings-coverage`      | Unset   |
| `test_script`          | No       | If defined, runs the script of this name in `package.json` to run the test suite.                                       | `test`                        | Unset   |
| `package_manager`      | No       | Either `yarn` or `npm` or `pnpm`. Will install dependencies and build using the specified package manager.              | `yarn`                        | `npm`   |
| `js_path`              | No       | Path to your JS folder (where `package.json` is located) from the root of your repository.                              | `./js`                        | `./js`  |
| `do_not_commit`        | No       | Set to `true` to NOT commit the built JS/Typings. Useful for validating JS source.                                      | `false`                       | `false` |

| `commit_all_dirty`     | No       | Set to `true` to commit all file changes, not just files in the dist JS directory.                                      | `false`                       | `false` |

### Assumptions

Your Javascript must be in a `js` folder, similar to how Flarum core and Flarum's first-party extensions are laid out.

If building typings, we assume that they are built to `js/dist-typings`, as set in the example `tsconfig.json` found on the [flarum-tsconfig](https://github.com/flarum/flarum-tsconfig).

## Only Build on Master

If you only want to run the workflow when commits are pushed to the `master` branch, change `on: push` to the following:

```yml
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
255,"setup-ninja

## Usage

GoReleaser Action runs [goreleaser][], please follow its [docs][gdocs] for
more information about how to customize what GoReleaser do.

[goreleaser]: https://goreleaser.com/
[gdocs]: https://goreleaser.com/customization

### Workflow

```yaml
```

> **IMPORTANT**: note the `fetch-depth: 0` input in `Checkout` step. It is required  for the changelog to work correctly.

### Run on new tag

If you want to run GoReleaser only on new tag, you can use this event:

```yaml
```

Or with a condition on GoReleaser step:

```yaml
```

> For detailed instructions please follow GitHub Actions [workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#About-yaml-syntax-for-workflows).

### Signing

If [signing is enabled](https://goreleaser.com/customization/#Signing) in your GoReleaser configuration, you can use
the [Import GPG](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) GitHub Action along with this one:

```yaml
```

And reference the fingerprint in your signing configuration using the `GPG_FINGERPRINT` environment variable:

```yaml
```

### Upload artifacts

For some events like pull request or schedule you might want to store the artifacts somewhere for testing
purpose. You can do that with the [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action:

```yaml
```

### Install Only

```yaml
```

| `GORELEASER_KEY` | Your [GoReleaser Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) License Key, in case you are using the `goreleaser-pro` distribution                              |

## Limitation

`GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions [are limited to the repository](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret)
that contains your workflow.

If you need to push the homebrew tap to another repository, you must therefore create a custom [Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
with `repo` permissions and [add it as a secret in the repository](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). If you create a
secret named `GH_PAT`, the step will look like this:

```yaml
```

## Migrating from v3

If you need the auto-snapshot feature, take a look at [this example repository](https://github.com/caarlos0/goreleaser-action-v4-auto-snapshot-example): it\'s a minimal working example with all you need.

> A GitHub action that creates [releases for Sentry.io](https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=javascript).

## What is sentry-releases-action?

A GitHub action that makes is easy to create a release in Sentry.io based on events in GitHub. Examples:

* a GitHub release is published
* a commit is pushed to master
* a pull request is merged to master

## How do I use it?

First thing first, let\'s make sure you have the necessary pre-requisites.

### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repo\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

#### `tagName`

**Required** The tag being released. This is used as the Sentry release name. You can optionally prefix it using `releaseNamePrefix`.

#### `environment`

**Required** The name of the environment the release was deployed to.

#### `releaseNamePrefix`

**Optional** String that is prefixed to the tag to form the Sentry release name.

> Please review Sentry\'s documentation regarding max length and supported characters in release names.

For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

#### `sourceMapOptions`

**Optional** A JSON object containing options to control [source map uploading](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps).

Refer to [Sentry\'s CLI JS](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/blob/1f5cdbb6897e41a7e9a3892aea3b34b4c0341207/js/releases/index.js#L114-L144) for possible values. The only required value is `include` which is an array of paths to upload source maps from.

### Environment Variables

#### `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

**Required** Sentry auth token. The token needs the `org:read` and `project:releases` scopes.

#### `SENTRY_ORG`

**Required** Sentry organization.

#### `SENTRY_PROJECT`

**Required** Sentry project name.

#### `SENTRY_URL`

**Optional** URL to the Sentry instance, useful for e.g. on-prem deployments.

## Example usage

```yml
```

> Note: `sentry-releases-action` will automatically trim `refs/tags/` from `tagName`. This means you can pass `GITHUB_REF` directly from release events without the need of mutating it first.

If you prefer to use the commit as the release name, use `${{ github.sha }}` for the `tagName` parameter.

### Full example workflow

On every GitHub `release` event.

```yaml
```

Assume you tagged your release as `v1.0.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.0.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `v1.0.0`.

### Example workflow with optional release prefix

On every GitHub `release` event.

```yaml
          releaseNamePrefix: myAwesomeProject-
```

Scenario 1: Assume you tagged your release as `v1.1.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject-v1.1.0`.

Scenario 2: Assume you tagged your release as `1.1.0` and you set `releaseNamePrefix` to `myAwesomeProject@`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject@1.1.0`.

> Note: This action only works on Linux x86_64 systems.

### Example workflow with optional sourcemap upload

On every GitHub `release` event.

```yaml
          releaseNamePrefix: myAwesomeProject-
          sourceMapOptions: \'{""include"": [""build""]}\'
```

As noted above, refer to [Sentry\'s CLI JS](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/blob/1f5cdbb6897e41a7e9a3892aea3b34b4c0341207/js/releases/index.js#L114-L144) for possible values. `include` is the only required value.

> Note: This action only works on Linux x86_64 systems.

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/actions/setup-haskell/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/setup-haskell)

This action sets up a Haskell environment for use in actions by:

- optionally installing a version of [ghc](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/) and [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) and adding to PATH.
- optionally installing a version of [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) and adding to PATH.
- setting the outputs of `ghc-path`, `cabal-path`, `stack-path`, and `cabal-store` when necessary.

The GitHub runners come with [pre-installed versions of GHC and Cabal](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners). Those will be used whenever possible.
For all other versions, this action utilizes [`ppa:hvr/ghc`](https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc), [`ghcup`](https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/ghcup-hs), and [`chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghc).

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Minimal:

```yaml
```

Basic:

```yaml

- `8.2.2` `8.2`
- `8.0.2` `8.0`
- `7.10.3` `7.10`

Suggestion: Try to support the three latest major versions of GHC.

**Cabal:**

- `latest` (default, recommended)
- `3.2.0.0` `3.2`
- `3.0.0.0` `3.0`
- `2.4.1.0` `2.4`
- `2.4.0.0`
- `2.2.0.0` `2.2`

Recommendation: Use the latest available version if possible.

**Stack:**

- `latest` (recommended) -- follows the latest release automatically.
- `2.3.1` `2.3`
- `2.1.3` `2.1`
- `2.1.1`
- `1.9.3.1` `1.9`
- `1.9.1.1`
- `1.7.1` `1.7`
- `1.6.5` `1.6`
- `1.6.3.1`
- `1.6.1.1`
- `1.5.1` `1.5`
- `1.5.0`
- `1.4.0` `1.4`
- `1.3.2` `1.3`
- `1.3.0`
- `1.2.0` `1.2`

Recommendation: Use the latest available version if possible.

The full list of available versions of GHC, Cabal, and Stack are as follows:

- [Linux/macOS - Cabal and GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html)
- [Windows - Cabal](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cabal#versionhistory).
- [Windows - GHC](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ghc#versionhistory)
- [Linux/macOS/Windows - Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/tags)

Note: There are _technically_ some descrepencies here. For example, ""8.10.1-alpha1"" will work for a ghc version for windows but not for Linux and macOS. For your sanity, I suggest sticking with the version lists above which are supported across all three operating systems.

264,"# julia-pkgbutler

## Overview

The GitHub Action repository for the Julia Package Butler.

The underlying functionality for `julia-pkgbutler` is provided by the [`PkgButlerEngine.jl` Julia package](https://github.com/davidanthoff/PkgButlerEngine.jl).

## Functionality

The Julia Package Butler currently makes the following changes to a package repository:

- The GitHub Action workflow for the Package Butler itself is updated to the latest version.
- If the `Project.toml` doesn't have a version bound for `julia` in the `compat` section, it will add a version bound declaring the package compatible with Julia 1.0.
- It will add GitHub Action workflows for continuous integration. These workflows are automatically configured to only run on Julia versions that are compatible with the `compat` entry for Julia in the `Project.toml` file of the package.
- If a `docs/make.jl` file exists, a GitHub Action workflow that builds and deploys documentation is added to the package.
- If a `docs/Project.toml` file exists, the butler will ensure that the version bound on Documenter.jl is no lower than 0.24 (the first version to support building documentation with GitHub Actions).
- Enable [CompatHelper.jl](https://github.com/bcbi/CompatHelper.jl) for the repository.
- Enable [TagBot](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot) for the repository.

When the `bach` template is used, these additional channges are made:
- Travis and Appveyor configuration files are removed.
- Whenever any Julia file on `master` is not properly formatted, a PR with formatting changes is opened (based on https://github.com/julia-vscode/DocumentFormat.jl).
- Any PR has an additional check whether Julia code files are properly formatted.

### Julia Versions

You can either specify specific Julia versions or version ranges. If you specify a version range, the **highest** available Julia version that matches the range will be selected.

> **Warning**
>
> It is strongly recommended to wrap versions in quotes. Otherwise, the YAML parser used by GitHub Actions parses certain versions as numbers which causes the wrong version to be selected. For example, `1.0` may be parsed as `1`.

#### Examples

- `1.2.0` is a valid semver version. The action will try to download exactly this version. If it\'s not available, the build step will fail.
- `1.0` is a version range that will match the highest available Julia version that starts with `1.0`, e.g. `1.0.5`, excluding pre-releases.
- `^1.3.0-rc1` is a **caret** version range that includes pre-releases of `1.3.0` starting at `rc1`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-rc1` and `< 2.0.0`.
- `~1.3.0-rc1` is a **tilde** version range that includes pre-releases of `1.3.0` starting at `rc1`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-rc1` and `< 1.4.0`.
- `^1.3.0-0` is a **caret** version range that includes _all_ pre-releases of `1.3.0`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-` and `< 2.0.0`.
- `~1.3.0-0` is a **tilde** version range that includes _all_ pre-releases of `1.3.0`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-` and `< 1.4.0`.
- `nightly` will install the latest nightly build.
- `1.7-nightly` will install the latest nightly build for the upcoming 1.7 release. This version will only be available during certain phases of the Julia release cycle.

Internally the action uses node\'s semver package to resolve version ranges. Its [documentation](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#advanced-range-syntax) contains more details on the version range syntax. You can test what version will be selected for a given input in this JavaScript [REPL](https://repl.it/@SaschaMann/setup-julia-version-logic).

#### Prereleases

There are two methods of including pre-releases in version matching:

1. Including the pre-release tag in the version itself, e.g. `^1.3.0-rc1`.
2. Setting the input `include-all-prereleases` to `true`.

These behave slightly differently.

1. If the version `a.b.c` contains pre-release tag, all pre-releases of version `a.b.c` will be included in the version matching.
For example, `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.3.0-rc2` but would **not** match `1.4.0-rc1` once released.
2. If `include-preleases` is set to true, **all** pre-releases of all versions will be included in the version matching. In this case, `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.4.0-rc1` once released.

**Example:** Without `include-all-prereleases: true`, the version `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.3.0-rc1`, `1.3.0-rc2`, `1.3.0`, `1.4.0` once they are released.
With `include-all-prereleases: true`, it would match `1.3.0-rc1`, `1.3.0-rc2`, `1.3.0`, `1.4.0-rc1`, `1.4.0`.

If you want to run tests against the latest tagged version, no matter what version that is, you can use

```yaml
```

#### Recently released versions

The available Julia versions are pulled from [`versions.json`](https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json).

### Matrix Testing

`bash` is chosen as shell to enforce consistent behaviour across operating systems. [Other shells](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell) are available but you may have to escape quotation marks or otherwise adjust the syntax.

#### 64-bit Julia only

```yaml
```

#### 32-bit Julia

```yaml
```

Alternatively, you can include specific version and OS combinations that will use 32-bit Julia:

```yaml
```

### versioninfo

By default, only the output of `julia --version` is printed as verification that Julia has been installed for stable versions of Julia.
`InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()` is run by default for nightly builds.

Starting Julia and printing the full versioninfo takes a significant amount of time (1s or ~10% of the total build time in testing), so you may not want to run it in every build, in particular on paid runners as this cost will add up quickly.
However, `julia --version` does not provide sufficient information to know which commit a nightly binary was built from, therefore it is useful to show the full versioninfo on nightly builds regardless.

You can override this behaviour by changing the input to `never` if you never want to run `InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()` or to `true` if you always want to run `InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()`, even on stable Julia builds.

## Versioning

This action follows [GitHub\'s advice](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#versioning-your-action) on versioning actions, with an additional `latest` tag.

If you don\'t want to deal with updating the version of the action, similiarly to how Travis CI handles it, use `latest` or major version branches. [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) can also be used to automatically create Pull Requests to update actions used in your workflows.

It\'s unlikely, but not impossible, that there will be breaking changes post-v1.0.0 unless a new major version of Julia is introduced.

You can specify commits, branches or tags in your workflows as follows:

```yaml
```

If your workflow requires access to secrets, you should always pin it to a commit SHA instead of a tag.
This will protect you in case a bad actor gains access to the setup-julia repo.
You can find more information in [GitHub\'s security hardening guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions).

## Debug logs

You can enable [Step Debug Logs](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs) for more detailed logs.
Note that when debug logs are enabled, a request will be sent to `https://httpbin.julialang.org/ip` and the runner\'s IP will be printed to the debug logs.

267,"# julia-runtest Action

This action runs the tests in a Julia package.

## Usage

Julia needs to be installed before this action can run. This can easily be achieved with the [setup-julia](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-julia-environment) action.

An example workflow that uses this action might look like this:

```yaml
```

You can add this workflow to your repository by placing it in a file called `test.yml` in the folder `.github/workflows/`. [More info here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

Here, setting `annotate: true` causes GitHub ""annotations"" to appear when reviewing the PR, pointing to failing tests, if any.
This functionality is only enabled on Julia 1.8 (even if `annotate` is set to `true`), since currently it does not work on other Julia versions (see #76).

By default, `annotate` is set to false, but that may change in future releases of this action.
### Prefixing the Julia command

In some packages, you may want to prefix the `julia` command with another command, e.g. for running tests of certain graphical libraries with `xvfb-run`.
In that case, you can add an input called `prefix` containing the command that will be inserted to your workflow:

```yaml
```

If you only want to add this prefix on certain builds, you can [include additional values into a combination](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-additional-values-into-combinations) of your build matrix, e.g.:

```yaml
```

This will add the prefix `xvfb-run` to all builds where the `os` is `ubuntu-latest`.


### Registry flavor preference

This actions defines (and exports for subsequent steps of the workflow) the
environmental variable `JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE=eager` unless it

Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a JavaScript action.:rocket:

This template includes compilication support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.  

If you are new, there\'s also a simpler introduction.  See the [Hello World JavaScript Action](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action)

## Create an action from this template

Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action

## Code in Master

Install the dependencies  
```bash
```

Build the typescript
```bash
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  
```bash
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos.  We will create a releases branch and only checkin production modules (core in this case). 

Comment out node_modules in .gitignore and create a releases/v1 branch
```bash
```

```bash
```

```bash
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing the releases/v1 branch

```yaml

### Customizing installation of package into docs environment

In some packages, you may want to install the package yourself into the docs environment. For example, if the package is in a subdirectory (but the docs environment is still top-level). In this case, you can pass `install-package: false`.

```yaml
```

271,"# <img src=""logo.png"" width=""60""> Julia TagBot

TagBot creates tags, releases, and changelogs for your Julia packages when they\'re registered.

When we talk about tags and releases, we mean *Git tags* and *GitHub releases*, and not releases in a registry that allow the Julia package manager to install your package.
TagBot does not register your package for you, see the documentation in [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and [Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/blob/master/README.md) for that.
Instead, it reacts to versions of your packages that have been registered, making TagBot a set-and-forget solution to keep your repository in sync with your package releases.
Tags and releases aren\'t at all necessary, but it\'s considered a good practice.

Other benefits of using TagBot include the ability for you and your users to browse package code at specific releases, and automatically-generated changelogs for each release that keep your users in the loop.

## Setup

Create a file at `.github/workflows/TagBot.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
```

No further action is required on your part.
When you add a new release to a registry with Registrator, TagBot will create a GitHub release on your package\'s repository.

You may, however, want to customize the behaviour via the available configuration options.

For example, if you use GitHub Actions to build the documentation for your package, you will find that with the default TagBot configuration, your documentation build is not triggered when a new tag is created.
In this case, you will need to use [SSH Deploy Keys](#ssh-deploy-keys).

Read on for a full description of all of the available configuration options.

## Table of Contents

- Basic Configuration Options:
  - [SSH Deploy Keys](#ssh-deploy-keys)
  - [Changelogs](#changelogs)
  - [Custom Registries](#custom-registries)
- Advanced Configuration Options:
  - [Self-Hosted GitHub](#self-hosted-github)
  - [Git configuration](#git-configuration)
  - [GPG Signing](#gpg-signing)
  - [Lookback Period](#lookback-period)
  - [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats)
  - [Pre-Release Hooks](#pre-release-hooks)
  - [Release Branch Selection](#release-branch-selection)
  - [Release Branch Management](#release-branch-management)
- [Local Usage](#local-usage)

## Basic Configuration Options

### SSH Deploy Keys

Sometimes, instead of using the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, it is better to use an SSH deploy key.
The most notable reason is that the default token does not have permission to trigger events for other GitHub Actions, such as documentation builds for new tags.

To use an SSH deploy key:

- Create an SSH key and add it to your repository by following the instructions [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#setup-2).
  Make sure to give it write permissions.
- Create a repository secret by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).
  Use whatever you like as the name, such as `SSH_KEY`.
  Use the private key contents as the value.
- Add the `ssh` input:

```yml
```

If you already have a Base64-encoded deploy key and matching repository secret for Documenter, you can reuse it instead of creating a new one.

If your key is password-protected, you\'ll also need to include the password in another repository secret (not Base64-encoded):

```yml
  ssh_password: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSWORD }}
```

### Changelogs

TagBot creates a changelog for each release based on the issues that have been closed and the pull requests that have been merged.
Additionally, you can write custom release notes in the same place that you register your packages.
See [Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/#release-notes) or [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) for specifics.

The changelog is completely customizable with the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine.
To supply your own template, use the `changelog` input:

```yml
```

The data available to you looks like this:

```json
```

You can see the default template in [`action.yml`](action.yml).

Issues and pull requests with specified labels are not included in the changelog data.
By default, the following labels are ignored:

- changelog skip
- duplicate
- exclude from changelog
- invalid
- no changelog
- question
- wont fix

To supply your own labels, use the `changelog_ignore` input:

```yml
```

White-space, case, dashes, and underscores are ignored when comparing labels.

### Custom Registries

If you\'re using a custom registry, add the `registry` input:

```yml
```

If your registry is public, this is all you need to do.
If your registry is private, you\'ll need to configure access to it via one of two options.

The first option is to change the `token` input to a [PAT](#personal-access-tokens-pats) that has access to both your package repository and the registry.
Take a look at the warnings about PATs if you choose this option.

The other option is to use the `registry_ssh` input, like so:

```yml
  registry_ssh: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_SSH_KEY }}
```

Here, the `REGISTRY_SSH_KEY` is the private key portion of a read-only [SSH deploy key](#ssh-deploy-keys) for your registry.
By using this method, the only extra access that TagBot receives is read access to your private registry, not to any other repositories in your user/organization account.

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Self-Hosted GitHub

If your company is running their own GitHub server, then you\'ll need to update the relevant GitHub URL inputs, `github` and `github_api`:

```yml
```

### Git Configuration

By default, the Git tags that TagBot creates are authored by a user called `github-actions[bot]`, whose email is `41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`.
If you want to use your own Git author info, you can set the `user` and `email` inputs:

```yml
```

### Draft Releases

If you\'d prefer to create a draft GitHub release instead of a full Git tag + GitHub release, use the `draft` input:


```yml
```

### GPG Signing

If you want to create signed tags, you can supply your own GPG private key.
Your key can be exported with `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <ID>`, and optionally Base64-encoded.
Create the repository secret, then use the `gpg` input:

```yml
```

If your key is password-protected, you\'ll also need to include the password in another repository secret (not Base64-encoded):

```yml
  gpg_password: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSWORD }}
```

It\'s also recommended to set your Git email address to one that is attached to the GPG key (see [Git Configuration](#git-configuration)).
If you fail to do so, your tags will be marked ""Unverified"" in the GitHub UI.

### Lookback Period

By default, TagBot checks for new releases that are at most 3 days old.
Therefore, if you only run TagBot every five days, it might miss some releases.
To fix this, you can specify a custom number of days to look back in time with the `lookback` input:

```yml
```

An extra hour is always added, so if you run TagBot every 5 days, you can safely set this input to `5`.

### Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

We highly recommend that you use an SSH deploy key instead of a personal access token (PAT).

Please keep in mind that there are security concerns with using a PAT.
For example, a PAT has access to all of your repositories.
To reduce the consequences of a secret being leaked, we recommend that you instead use an [SSH deploy key](#ssh-deploy-keys) that only has permissions for a single repository.


To use a PAT:

- Create a PAT by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token).
  Make sure that it has the `repo` scope.
- Create a repository secret by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).
  Use whatever you like as the name, such as `TAGBOT_PAT`.
  Use the new PAT as the value.
- Replace the `token` input\'s value with the name of your secret, like so:

```yml
```

### Pre-Release Hooks

If you want to make something happen just before releases are created, you can do so with the `dispatch` input:

```yml
  dispatch: true
```

When you enable this option, a [repository dispatch event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#repositorydispatchevent) is created before releases are created.
This means that you can set up your own actions that perform any necessary pre-release tasks.

The payload is an object mapping from version to commit SHA, which can contain multiple entries and looks like this:

```json
```

These actions will have 5 minutes to run by default, but you can customize the number of minutes with the `dispatch_delay` input:

```yml
  dispatch: true
  dispatch_delay: 30
```

Avoid setting a delay longer than the interval between TagBot runs, since your dispatch event will probably be triggered multiple times and the same release will also be attempted more than once.

To use the `dispatch` feature, you must provide your own personal access token.
For more details, see [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats).

### Release Branch Selection

If you use a non-standard Git workflow where your default branch is not the main development branch, you may want to set the `branch` input to the name of your preferred release branch:

```yml
```

The branch you set will be the first one searched for a commit to tag, and releases will be anchored to that branch when possible.

### Release Branch Management

If you\'re using [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) to release your packages, TagBot can manage the merging and deletion of the release branches that it creates.
To enable this feature, use the `branches` input:

```yml
```

## Local Usage

There are some scenarios in which you want to manually run TagBot.
Perhaps TagBot failed for some reason, or GitHub\'s service was down, or you just set up TagBot but would like to fill in tags for old releases.
The simplest way to run TagBot manually is through Docker and the `tagbot.local` module.

```sh
```

Only the `repo`, `version`, and `token` options are required, and you will be prompted if you don\'t provide them.
For instructions on how to obtain a token, see [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats).

You can also run the code outside of Docker, but you\'ll just need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) first, and ensure that you have Python 3.8.

```sh
```

275,"# Google Java Format Action

Automatically format your Java files using [Google Java Style guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

This action automatically downloads the latest release of the [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) program.

This action can format your files and push the changes, or just check the formatting without committing anything.

You must checkout your repository with `actions/checkout` before calling this action (see the example).

## Examples

Format all Java files in the repository and commit the changes:

```yml
```

Check if the formatting is correct without pushing anything:

```yml
```

Print the diff of every incorrectly formatted file, and fail if there is any:

```yml
```

## Inputs

None of these inputs is required, but you can add them to change the behavior of this action.

### `github-token`

**Recommended if you execute this action from GitHub-hosted MacOS runners or from [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)**. Because of [IP-address based rate limiting](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/602), calling the GitHub API from any small pool of IPs, [including the GitHub-hosted MacOS runners](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/602#issuecomment-602472951), can result in an error. To overcome this, provide the [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) to authenticate these calls. If you provide it, it will also be used to authenticate the commits made by this action.

### `version`

Set this input to use a [specific version of Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases). For example: `1.7`, `1.8`...

### `files`

A pattern to match the files to format. The default is `**/*.java`, which means that all Java files in your repository will be formatted.

### `files-excluded`

A pattern to match the files to be ignored. Optional.

### `skip-commit`

Set to `true` if you don\'t want the changes to be committed by this action. Default: `false`.

### `commit-message`

You can specify a custom commit message. Default: `Google Java Format`.

### `args`

The arguments to pass to the Google Java Format executable.
By default, only `--replace` is used.

```console
```

Note:

- If you add `--dry-run` or `-n`, no commit will be made.
- The argument `--set-exit-if-changed` will work as expected and this action will fail if some files need to be formatted.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/workflows/build-and-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/actions)

It\'s the official GitHub action for [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) from its authors.
The action runs [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and reports issues from linters.

![GitHub Annotations](./static/annotations.png)

## Compatibility

* `v3.0.0+` requires explicit setup-go installation step prior to using this action: `uses: actions/setup-go@v3`.
  The `skip-go-installation` option has been removed.
* `v2.0.0+` works with `golangci-lint` version >= `v1.28.3`
* `v1.2.2` is deprecated due to we forgot to change the minimum version of `golangci-lint` to `v1.28.3` ([issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/issues/39))
* `v1.2.1` works with `golangci-lint` version >= `v1.14.0` ([issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/issues/39))

## How to use

Add `.github/workflows/golangci-lint.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
```

We recommend running this action in a job separate from other jobs (`go test`, etc)
because different jobs [run in parallel](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/core-concepts-for-github-actions#job).

### Multiple OS Support

If you need to run linters for specific operating systems, you will need to use `v2` of the action.  Here is a sample configuration file:

```yaml
```

You will also likely need to add the following `.gitattributes` file to ensure that line endings for windows builds are properly formatted:

```.gitattributes
```

## Comments and Annotations

Currently, GitHub parses the action\'s output and creates [annotations](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/What-are-annotations/td-p/30770).

The restrictions of annotations are the following:

1. Currently, they don\'t support markdown formatting (see the [feature request](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-API-Development-and/Checks-Ability-to-include-Markdown-in-line-annotations/m-p/56704))
2. They aren\'t shown in list of comments like it was with [golangci.com](https://golangci.com). If you would like to have comments - please, up-vote [the issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/issues/5).

## Performance

The action was implemented with performance in mind:

1. We cache data by [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache) between builds: Go build cache, Go modules cache, golangci-lint analysis cache.
2. We don\'t use Docker because image pulling is slow.
3. We do as much as we can in parallel, e.g. we download cache, go and golangci-lint binary in parallel.

For example, in a repository of [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) running this action without the cache takes 50s, but with cache takes 14s:
  * in parallel:
    * 4s to restore 50 MB of cache
    * 1s to find and install `golangci-lint`
  * 1s to run `golangci-lint` (it takes 35s without cache)

## Internals

We use JavaScript-based action. We don\'t use Docker-based action because:

1. docker pulling is slow currently
2. it\'s easier to use caching from [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache)

We support different platforms, such as `ubuntu`, `macos` and `windows` with `x32` and `x64` archs.

Inside our action we perform 3 steps:

1. Setup environment running in parallel:
  * restore [cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) of previous analyzes
  * fetch [action config](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/assets/github-action-config.json) and find the latest `golangci-lint` patch version
    for needed version (users of this action can specify only minor version of `golangci-lint`). After that install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) using [@actions/tool-cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/tool-cache)
2. Run `golangci-lint` with specified by user `args`
3. Save cache for later builds

### Caching internals

1. We save and restore the following directories: `~/.cache/golangci-lint`, `~/.cache/go-build`, `~/go/pkg`.
2. The primary caching key looks like `golangci-lint.cache-{interval_number}-{go.mod_hash}`. Interval number ensures that we periodically invalidate
   our cache (every 7 days). `go.mod` hash ensures that we invalidate the cache early - as soon as dependencies have changed.
3. We use [restore keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key): `golangci-lint.cache-{interval_number}-`. GitHub matches keys by prefix if we have no exact match for the primary cache.

This scheme is basic and needs improvements. Pull requests and ideas are welcome.

## Development of this action

1. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation)
2. Make a symlink for `act` to work properly: `ln -s . golangci-lint-action`
3. Prepare deps once: `npm run prepare-deps`
4. Run `npm run local` after any change to test it

279,"# artifact_as_comment

## What?

Fetches an artifact file and adds it inline as a comment to a Pull request.

## Why?

Certain jobs' output are useful to have in the PR without navigating away. For example, a code coverage report, or a benchmark run.

Github Actions' scope is limited to `read` access when running against a Pull Request created from a fork. While this is understandable, it limits the ability
of Github Action to publish results mentioned above.

## How?

The roundabout (hacky?) way:

- Use this action to schedule a workflow to run periodically, to scan open pull requests, 
  and it's latest workflow runs to determine if there is an output worth publishing.

- if there's a match, fetch the artifact and post it's content as a comment.

- get the pull request actions to run the jobs and store the output in a certain file.

## Introduction\r
This GitHub Action starts a Redis server on the default port `6379`.\r
\r
This is useful when running tests against a Redis database.\r
\r
\r
## Usage\r
A code example says more than a 1000 words. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an exemplary GitHub Action using a Redis server in versions 4 and 5 to test a Node.js app:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using a Custom Redis Image\r
You can utilize an alternative Redis image using the `redis-image` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using Redis on a Custom Port\r
You can start the Redis instance on a custom port using the `redis-port` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
\r
### Using a Custom Container Name\r
This GitHub Action provides a Redis Docker container. The default container name is `redis`. It can be helpful to customize the container name. For example, when running multiple Redis instances in parallel. You can customize the container name using the `redis-container-name` input:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
### Remove container when exit\r
Starting in v1.6.0, when running this action on a self-hosted runner, it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to remove the container so its name won\xe2\x80\x99t conflict:\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r

A GitHub action to run `percy exec` CLI commands for visual testing. [Full API docs for this action
can be found here](https://docs.percy.io/docs/github-actions#section-exec-action)

## Quick start

To use the Percy exec GitHub action you will need to add a new step to your
actions config using the `percy/exec-action` action. `exec-action` has one
required input: the command to run your tests. You will also need to set your
`PERCY_TOKEN` in your GitHub projects settings.

Below is a sample config that runs Cypress with Percy:

``` yaml
```
","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

<p align=""left"">
  <a href=""https://github.com/volta-cli/action""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/volta-cli/action/workflows/CI/badge.svg""></a>
</p>

This action installs [volta](https://volta.sh) by:

- downloading and caching volta (adding it to your $PATH)
- optionally downloading and caching a version of node - npm by version spec and add to PATH

<!-- action-docs-inputs -->
## Inputs

| parameter | description | required | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| volta-version | Version of `volta` to fetch and setup. Examples: 0.6.0, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0 | `false` |  |
| node-version | Version Spec of the node version to use.  Examples: 10.6.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0 | `false` |  |
| npm-version | Version Spec of the npm version to use.  Examples: 7.5.x, 7.5.3, >=7.5.3 | `false` |  |
| yarn-version | Version Spec of the yarn version to use.  Examples: 1.6.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0 | `false` |  |
| package-json-path | The path to the package.json to update when using an explicit `node-version` | `yarn-version` | `npm-version` override. By default, we will use `package.json` in the checkout root. | `false` |  |
| variant | Specific variant to install. Example: providing the variant ""linux-openssl-rhel"", which will target installing the volta-${version}-linux-openssl-rhel.tar.gz tarball | `false` |  |
| registry-url | Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN | `false` |  |
| scope | Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries. Will fall back to the repository owner when using the GitHub Packages registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com/). | `false` |  |
| token | Used to avoid low rate limiting for cached tool downloads.  Since there\'s a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. | `false` | ${{ github.token }} |
| always-auth | Set always-auth in npmrc | `false` | false |
<!-- action-docs-inputs -->

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic (when the project\'s `package.json` has a `volta` property with `node` and/or `yarn` versions pinned):

```yaml
```

Manually specifying node and/or yarn versions (e.g. to test a project without `volta` in `package.json`):

```yaml
```

Setting up a matrix of node versions:

```yaml
```

You can also specify the version of npm:

```yaml
```

In some cases, you may know the particular variant of the installer that you want to use for Volta. You can specify the `variant` input to the action to use a specific installer:

```yaml
```

The `variant` fragment corresponds to a portion of the installer filename, and can be found in the [Volta Releases](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/releases) page.

286,"# action-visual-snapshot ![test](https://github.com/getsentry/action-visual-snapshot/workflows/test/badge.svg)

This is a GitHub action that compares 2-3 sets of images and produces a diff using [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff). The idea is to have your tests generate screenshots, save those screenshots as an artifact in GitHub, compare them to a ""base"" (e.g. main branch) set of images and produce a diff image of the changed pixels, and then upload those diffs as an artifact as well.

## Usage

There are two steps required in your GitHub workflow. First, upload your snapshots as GitHub Action artifact. `path` needs to reference the path where your snapshots are saved and `name` is the name of the artifact for GitHub.

```yml
```

Then you\'ll need to run the action to compare the snapshots (`gcs-bucket` and `gcp-service-account-key`
are optional and will upload your images to the bucket if specified):

```yml
```

### Multiple diffs
You can also have multiple sets of diff actions with some configuration inputs

```yaml
```

## Contributing
WIP

### Updating Image Gallery Template

The main template is `src/template/index.ejs` -- this gets ""built"" into a module (that is
the actual template) that the action can use and inject data into.

```bash
```

Files changes to `src/template/index.ejs` will rebuild the `example_gallery/index.html` file (although you currently
need to save the file twice).


### Publishing
Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder, this is done by GitHub Actions for all branches.

To do this manually, run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
```

### Local Testing

You can run this action locally with a script similar to the following:

```bash
```
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
287,"action-html-to-image
====================

converts html to images for use in visual snapshot tests

### running the docker image locally

the docker image expects some things from github, you can simulate this:

1. make an `html` folder
1. make a `t.css` file inside of that (can be empty)
1. make some `*.html` files inside the `html` folder

```bash
```

### testing the image from a PR

each PR will build and publish a docker image.  you can try this image in a PR
by applying a diff like this (use your sha instead!):

```diff
```

  A GitHub action that compares the real cost of your JavaScript in every pull request
</p>
<p align=""center"">
  <img alt=""tests status"" src=""https://github.com/andresz1/size-limit-action/workflows/test/badge.svg"">
</p>

This action uses [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) (performance budget tool for JavaScript) to calculate the real cost of your JavaScript for end-users. The main features of this action are:

- **Commenting** pull requests with the comparison of Size Limit output.
- **Rejecting** a pull request if the cost exceeds the limit.

<p align=""center"">
  <img alt=""pr comment"" width=""540"" src=""/assets/pr.png"">
</p>

## Usage
1. Install Size Limit choosing the scenario that fits you better ([JS Application](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#js-applications), [Big Libraries](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#big-libraries) or [Small Libraries](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#small-libraries)).
2. By default this action will try to build your PR by running `build` [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) located in your `package.json`. If something need to be done after dependencies are installed but before building `postinstall` npm script could be used. For example, using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna):
```json
```
3. Define Size limit configuration. For example (inside `package.json`):
```json
```
4. Add the following action inside `.github/workflows/size-limit.yml`
```yaml
```
You can optionally specify a custom npm script to run instead of the default `build` adding a `build_script` option to the yml workflow shown above. Additionally, providing a `skip_step` option will tell the action to skip either the `install` or `build` phase.

```yaml
```

Add `clean_script` option to specify npm script to run after size-limit results are collected. This is useful to clean up leftover assets.

```yaml
```

5. You are now all set

### Customizing working directory

`directory` option allow to run all the tasks in a subfolder.
It\'s only convenient if all your stuff is in a subdirectory of your git repository.

For instance, if `package.json` is in the subfolder `client/`:

```yaml
  directory: client/
```

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m ""prod dependencies""
$ git push origin main
```

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Usage:

In your workflow file

```
```

See [action.yml](action.yml) for more arguments.

## Drafting a new release

Anybody from engineering can release. Just go to [GitHub\'s create release
page](https://github.com/getsentry/action-migrations/releases) and do it.
Create a new tag vX.Y.Z, the rest doesn\'t really matter.
","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

## Installation

### Binary

`craft` is [distributed as a minified single JS binary](https://github.com/getsentry/craft/releases/latest).

### npm (not recommended)

Recommendation is to used this file directly but one can also install `craft` as
an [NPM package](https://yarn.pm/@sentry/craft) and can be installed via `yarn`
or `npm`:

```shell
```

```shell
```

## Usage

```shell
```

## Caveats

- When interacting with remote GitHub repositories, `craft` uses the
  remote `origin` by default. If you have a different setup, set the
  `CRAFT_REMOTE` environment variable or the `--remote` option to the git remote
  you are using.

## Global Configuration

Global configuration for `craft` can be done either by using environment
variables or by adding values to a configuration file (see below).

All command line flags can be set through environment variables by prefixing
them with `CRAFT_` and converting them to UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED versions:

```shell
```

Since Craft heavily relies on GitHub, it needs the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable to be set to a proper
[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for almost
anything. The token only needs `repo` scope (`repo:status` and `public_repo`
subscopes, to be precise).

Additional environment variables may be required when publishing to specific
targets (e.g. `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` for PyPI target).

### Environment Files

`craft` will read configuration variables (keys, tokens, etc.) from the
following locations:

- `$HOME/.craft.env`
- `$PROJECT_DIR/.craft.env`
- the shell\'s environment

where `$HOME` is the current user\'s home directory, and `$PROJECT_DIR` is the
directory where `.craft.yml` is located.

These locations will be checked in the order specified above, with values
found in one location overwriting anything found in previous locations. In other
words, environment variables will take precedence over either configuration
file, and the project-specific file will take precedence over the file in
`$HOME`.

The env files must be written in shell (`sh`/`bash`) format.
Leading `export` is allowed.

Example:

```shell
```

## Workflow

### `craft prepare`: Preparing a New Release

This command will create a new release branch, check the changelog entries,
run a version-bumping script, and push this branch to GitHub. We expect
that CI triggered by pushing this branch will result in release artifacts
being built and uploaded to the artifact provider you wish to use during the
subsequent `publish` step.

```shell
```

### `craft publish`: Publishing the Release

The command will find a release branch for the provided version. The normal flow
is for this release branch to be created automatically by `craft prepare`, but
that\'s not strictly necessary. Then, it subscribes to the latest status checks on
that branch. Once the checks pass, it downloads the release artifacts from the
artifact provider configured in `.craft.yml` and uploads them to the targets named
on the command line (and pre-configured in `.craft.yml`).

```shell
```

### Example

Let\'s imagine we want to release a new version of our package, and the version
in question is `1.2.3`.

We run `prepare` command first:

`$ craft prepare 1.2.3`

After some basic sanity checks this command creates a new release branch
`release/1.2.3`, runs the version-bumping script (`scripts/bump-version.sh`),
commits the changes made by the script, and then pushes the new branch to
GitHub. At this point CI systems kick in, and the results of those builds, as
well as built artifacts (binaries, NPM archives, Python wheels) are gradually
uploaded to GitHub.

To publish the built artifacts we run `publish`:

`$ craft publish 1.2.3`

This command will find our release branch (`release/1.2.3`), check the build
status of the respective git revision in GitHub, and then publish available
artifacts to configured targets (for example, to GitHub and NPM in the case of
Craft).

## Configuration File: `.craft.yml`

Project configuration for `craft` is stored in `.craft.yml` configuration file,
located in the project root.

### GitHub project

Craft tries to determine the GitHub repo information from the local git repo and
its remotes configuration. However, since `publish` command does not require a
local git checkout, you may want to hard-code this information into the
configuration itself:

```yaml
```

### Pre-release Command

This command will run on your newly created release branch as part of `prepare`
command. By default, it is set to `bash scripts/bump-version.sh`. Please refer
to the [Pre-release version bumping script conventions section](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions)
for more details.

```yaml
```

### Post-release Command

This command will run after a successful `publish`. By default, it is set to
`bash scripts/post-release.sh`. It will _not_ error if the default script is
missing though, as this may not be needed by all projects. Please refer to the
[Post-release script conventions section](#post-release-script-conventions)
for more details.

```yaml
```

### Release Branch Name

This overrides the prefix for the release branch name. The full branch name used
for a release is `{releaseBranchPrefix}/{version}`. The prefix defaults to
`""release""`.

```yaml
```

### Changelog Policies

`craft` can help you to maintain change logs for your projects. At the moment,
`craft` supports two approaches: `simple`, and `auto` to changelog management.

In `simple` mode, `craft prepare` will remind you to add a changelog entry to the
changelog file (`CHANGELOG.md` by default).

In `auto` mode, `craft prepare` will use the following logic:

1. If there\'s already an entry for the given version, use that
2. Else if there is an entry named `Unreleased`, rename that to the given
   version
3. Else, create a new section for the version and populate it with the changes
   since the last version. It uses [GitHub
   Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
   to provide a concise and rich changelog. If the PRs are associated with a
   milestone, the milestone title and description are used as the changelog
   entry alongside a brief list of associated PRs. Any individual commits and
   PRs are listed under the ""Various improvements & fixes"" section at the
   bottom. Check out [Craft\'s own
   releases](https://github.com/getsentry/craft/releases/) as example.

**Configuration**

| Option            | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `changelog`       | **optional**. Path to the changelog file. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md`                       |
| `changelogPolicy` | **optional**. Changelog management mode (`none`, `simple`, or `auto`). Defaults to `none`. |

**Example (`simple`):**

```yaml
```

**Valid changelog example:**

```text
```

**Example (`auto`):**

```yaml
```

**Changelog with staged changes example:**

```text
```

Additionally, `.craft.yml` is used for listing targets where you want to
publish your new release.

### Minimal Version

It is possible to specify minimal `craft` version that is required to work with
your configuration.

**Example:**

```yaml
```

### Required Files

You can provide a list of patterns for files that _have to be_ available before
proceeding with publishing. In other words, for every pattern in the given list
there has to be a file present that matches that pattern. This might be helpful
to ensure that we\'re not trying to do an incomplete release.

**Example:**

```yaml
```

## Status Provider

You can configure which status providers `craft` will use to check for your build status.
By default, it will use GitHub but you can add more providers if needed.

**Configuration**

| Option   | Description                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | Name of the status provider: only `github` (default) for now.                                      |
| `config` | In case of `github`: may include `contexts` key that contains a list of required contexts (checks) |

**Example:**

```yaml
```

## Artifact Provider

You can configure which artifact providers `craft` will use to fetch artifacts from.
By default, GitHub is used, but in case you don\'t need use any artifacts in your
project, you can set it to `none`.

**Configuration**

| Option | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | Name of the artifact provider: `github` (default), `gcs`, or `none` |

**Example:**

```yaml
```

## Target Configurations

The configuration specifies which release targets to run for the repository. To
run more targets, list the target identifiers under the `targets` key in
`.craft.yml`.

**Example:**

```yaml
```

### Per-target options

The following options can be applied to every target individually:

| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `includeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: only matched files will be processed by the target. There is one special case that `includeNames` supports.                                                          |
| `excludeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: the matched files will be skipped by the target. Matching is performed after testing for inclusion (via `includeNames`).                                             |
| `id`           | **optional**. A unique id for the target type so one can refer to that target individually with the `-t` option with the `publish` command like `-t registry[browser]`. (see the example config above) |

If neither option is included, all artifacts for the release will be processed by the target.

**Example:**

```yaml
```

### GitHub (`github`)

Create a release on Github. If a Markdown changelog is present in the
repository, this target tries to read the release name and description from the
changelog. Otherwise, defaults to the tag name and tag\'s commit message.

If `previewReleases` is set to `true` (which is the default), the release
created on GitHub will be marked as a pre-release version if the release name
contains any one of `preview`, `pre`, `rc`, `dev`,`alpha`, `beta`, `unstable`,
`a`, or `b`.

**Environment**

| Name           | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (see https://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option            | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tagPrefix`       | **optional**. Prefix for new git tags (e.g. ""v""). Empty by default.                              |
| `previewReleases` | **optional**. Automatically detect and create preview releases. `true` by default.               |
| `tagOnly`         | **optional**. If set to `true`, only create a tag (without a GitHub release).`false` by default. |

**Example:**

```yaml
```

### NPM (`npm`)

Releases an NPM package to the public registry. This requires a package tarball
generated by `npm pack` in the artifacts. The file will be uploaded to the
registry with `npm publish`, or with `yarn publish` if `npm` is not found. This
requires NPM to be authenticated with sufficient permissions to publish the package.

**Environment**

The `npm` utility must be installed on the system.

| Name                | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NPM_TOKEN`         | An [automation token][npm-automation-token] allowed to publish.     |
| `NPM_BIN`           | **optional**. Path to the npm executable. Defaults to `npm`         |
| `YARN_BIN`          | **optional**. Path to the yarn executable. Defaults to `yarn`       |
| `CRAFT_NPM_USE_OTP` | **optional**. If set to ""1"", you will be asked for an OTP (for 2FA) |

[npm-automation-token]: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens

**Configuration**

| Option   | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `access` | **optional**. Visibility for scoped packages: `restricted` (default) or `public` |

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Python Package Index (`pypi`)

Uploads source dists and wheels to the Python Package Index via [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).
The source code bundles and/or wheels must be in the release assets.

**Environment**

The `twine` Python package must be installed on the system.

| Name             | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `TWINE_USERNAME` | User name for PyPI with access rights for the package |
| `TWINE_PASSWORD` | Password for the PyPI user                            |
| `TWINE_BIN`      | **optional**. Path to twine. Defaults to `twine`      |

**Configuration**

_none_

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Sentry internal PyPI (`sentry-pypi`)

Creates a GitHub pull request to import the package into a repo set up
like [getsentry/pypi]

[getsentry/pypi]: https://github.com/getsentry/pypi

**Environment**

| Name           | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (see https://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option             | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `internalPypiRepo` | GitHub repo containing pypi metadata |

**Example**

```yaml
  - name: sentry-pypi
    internalPypiRepo: getsentry/pypi
```

### Homebrew (`brew`)

Pushes a new or updated homebrew formula to a brew tap repository. The formula
is committed directly to the master branch of the tap on GitHub, therefore the
bot needs rights to commit to `master` on that repository. Therefore, formulas
on `homebrew/core` are not supported, yet.

The tap is configured with the mandatory `tap` parameter in the same format as
the `brew` utility. A tap `<org>/<name>` will expand to the GitHub repository
`github.com:<org>/homebrew-<name>`.

The formula contents are given as configuration value and can be interpolated
with Mustache template syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context
contains the following variables:

- `version`: The new version
- `revision`: The tag\'s commit SHA
- `checksums`: A map containing sha256 checksums for every release asset. Use
  the full filename to access the sha, e.g. `checksums.MyProgram-x86`

**Environment**

| Name           | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (seeh ttps://github.com/settings/tokens) |

**Configuration**

| Option     | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tap`      | The name of the homebrew tap used to access the GitHub repo        |
| `template` | The template for contents of the formula file (ruby code)          |
| `formula`  | **optional**. Name of the formula. Defaults to the repository name |
| `path`     | **optional**. Path to store the formula in. Defaults to `Formula`  |

**Example**

```yaml
```

### NuGet (`nuget`)

Uploads packages to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) via [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core).
By default, `craft` publishes all packages with `.nupkg` extension.

**Environment**

The `dotnet` tool must be available on the system.

| Name               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NUGET_API_TOKEN`  | NuGet personal API token (https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys) |
| `NUGET_DOTNET_BIN` | **optional**. Path to .NET Core. Defaults to `dotnet`            |

**Configuration**

_none_

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Rust Crates (`crates`)

Publishes a single Rust package or entire workspace on the public crate registry
([crates.io](https://crates.io)). If the workspace contains multiple crates,
they are published in an order depending on their dependencies.

**Environment**

""cargo"" must be installed and configured on the system.

| Name              | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` | The access token to the crates.io account         |
| `CARGO_BIN`       | **optional**. Path to cargo. Defaults to `cargo`. |

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noDevDeps` | **optional**. Strips `devDependencies` from crates before publishing. This is useful if a workspace crate uses circular dependencies for docs. Requires [`cargo-hack`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack#readme) installed. Defaults to `false`. |

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Google Cloud Storage (`gcs`)

Uploads artifacts to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

The bucket paths (`paths`) can be interpolated using Mustache syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context contains the following variables:

- `version`: The new project version
- `revision`: The SHA revision of the new version

**Environment**

Google Cloud credentials can be provided using either of the following two environment variables.

| Name                          | Description                                                              |

| `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH` | Local filesystem path to Google Cloud credentials (service account file) |
| `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` | Full service account file contents, as a JSON string                     |

If defined, `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` will be preferred over `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH`.

_Note:_ `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH` were formerly called `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, respectively. While those names will continue to work for the foreseeable future, you\'ll receive a warning encouraging you to switch to the new names.

**Configuration**

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `paths.path`     | Template-aware bucket path, which can contain `{{ version }}` and/or `{{ revision }}`.                                                                                                                |
| `paths.metadata` | **optional** [Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/insert#request_properties_JSON) for uploaded files. By default, it sets `Cache-Control` to `""public, max-age=300""`. |

**Example**

```yaml
```

### GitHub Pages (`gh-pages`)

Extracts an archive with static assets and pushes them to the specified git
branch (`gh-pages` by default). Thus, it can be used to publish documentation
or any other assets to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so they will be later automatically rendered
by GitHub.

By default, this target will look for an artifact named `gh-pages.zip`, extract it,
and commit its contents to `gh-pages` branch.

_WARNING!_ The destination branch will be completely overwritten by the contents
of the archive.

**Environment**

_none_

**Configuration**

| Option        | Description                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `branch`      | **optional** The name of the branch to push the changes to. `gh-pages` by default.      |
| `githubOwner` | **optional** GitHub project owner, defaults to the value from the global configuration. |
| `githubRepo`  | **optional** GitHub project name, defaults to the value from the global configuration.  |

**Example**

```yaml
```

### Sentry Release Registry (`registry`)

The target will update the Sentry release registry repo(https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-release-registry/) with the latest version of the
project `craft` is used with. The release registry repository will be checked out
locally, and then the new version file will be created there, along with the necessary
symbolic links.

Two package types are supported: ""sdk"" and ""app"". Type ""sdk"" means that the package
is uploaded to one of the public registries (PyPI, NPM, Nuget, etc.), and that
the corresponding package directory can be found inside ""packages"" directory of the
release regsitry. Type ""app"" indicates that the package\'s version files are located
in ""apps"" directory of the registry.

It is strongly discouraged to have multiple `registry` targets in a config as it
supports grouping/batching multiple apps and SDKs in a single target.

**Environment**

_none_

**Configuration**

Pulls an existing source image tagged with the revision SHA, and then pushed it
to a new target tagged with the released version. No release
assets are required for this target except for the source image at the provided
source image location so it would be a good idea to add a status check that
ensures the source image exists, otherwise `craft publish` will fail at the
`docker pull` step, causing an interrupted publish. This is an issue for other,
non-idempotent targets, not for the Docker target.

**Environment**

`docker` executable (or something equivalent) must be installed on the system.

### pub.dev (`pub-dev`)

Pushes a new Dart or Flutter package to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).

Because there is [no automated way](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/5388) to login and obtain required tokens, you need to perform a valid release beforehand, for every package that you configure. This will open up your browser and use Google\'s OAuth to log you in, and generate an appropriate file with stored credentials.

Based on your environment, you can find this file at either `$HOME/.pub-cache/credentials.json` or `$HOME/Library/Application\\ Support/dart/pub-credentials.json` for OSX and `$HOME/.config/dart/pub-credentials.json` for Linux, depending on your setup.

For this target to work correctly, either `dart` must be installed on the system or a valid `dartCliPath` must be provided.

**Environment**

## Integrating Your Project with `craft`

Here is how you can integrate your GitHub project with `craft`:

1. Set up a workflow that builds your assets and runs your tests. Allow building
   release branches (their names follow `release/{VERSION}` by default,
   configurable through `releaseBranchPrefix`).

   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - \'release/**\'
   ```

2. Use the official `actions/upload-artifact@v2` action to upload your assets.
   Here is an example config (step) of an archive job:

   ```yaml
   - name: Archive Artifacts
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
     with:
       name: ${{ github.sha }}
       path: |
         ${{ github.workspace }}/*.tgz
         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/tracing/build/**
         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/**/*.tgz
   ```

   A few important things to note:

   - The name of the artifacts is very important and needs to be `name: ${{ github.sha }}`. Craft uses this as a unique id to fetch the artifacts.
   - Keep in mind that this action maintains the folder structure and zips everything together. Craft will download the zip and recursively walk it to find all assets.

3. Add `.craft.yml` configuration file to your project

   - List there all the targets you want to publish to
   - Configure additional options (changelog management policy, tag prefix, etc.)

4. Add a [pre-release script](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions) to your project.
5. Get various [configuration tokens](#global-configuration)
6. Run `craft prepare <version> --publish` and profit!

## Pre-release (Version-bumping) Script: Conventions

Among other actions, `craft prepare` runs an external, project-specific command
or script that is responsible for version bumping. By default, this script
should be located at: `./scripts/bump-version.sh`. The command can be configured
by specifying the `preReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.

The following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:

- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old (""from"")
  version and the new (""to"") version as the last two arguments, respectively.
- The script must replace all relevant occurrences of the old version string
  with the new one.
- The script must not commit the changes made.
- The script must not change the state of the git repository (e.g. changing branches)

**Example**

```bash
```

## Post-release Script: Conventions

Among other actions, `craft publish` runs an external, project-specific command
or script that can do things like bumping the development version. By default,
this script should be located at: `./scripts/post-release.sh`. Unlike the
pre-release command, this script is not mandatory so if the file does not exist,
`craft` will report this fact and then move along as usual. This command can be
configured by specifying `postReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.

The following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:

- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old (""from"")
  version and the new (""to"") version as the last two arguments, respectively.
- The script is responsible for any and all `git` state management as `craft` will
  simply exit after running this script as the final step. This means the script
  is responsible for committing and pushing any changes that it may have made.

**Example**

```bash
```

## Development

### Logging Level

Logging level for `craft` can be configured via setting the `CRAFT_LOG_LEVEL`
environment variable or using the `--log-level` CLI flag.

Accepted values are: `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Log`, `Info`, `Success`,
`Debug`, `Trace`, `Silent`, `Verbose`

### Dry-run Mode

Dry-run mode can be enabled via setting the `CRAFT_DRY_RUN` environment variable
to any truthy value (any value other than `undefined`, `null`, `""""`, `0`,
`false`, and `no`). One may also use the `--dry-run` CLI flag.

In dry-run mode no destructive actions will be performed (creating remote
branches, pushing tags, committing files, etc.)

### Sentry Support

Errors you encounter while using Craft can be sent to Sentry. To use this
feature, add `CRAFT_SENTRY_DSN` variable to your environment (or ""craft""
configuration file) that contains a Sentry project\'s DSN.

For example:

```shell
```

### Releasing

`craft` obviously uses `craft` for preparing and publishing new releases!

293,"An action that bumps a Homebrew formula after a new release.

Minimal usage example:

```yml
```

The `COMMITTER_TOKEN` secret is required because this action will want to write
to an external repository. You can [generate a new Personal Access Token (classic)
here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it `repo` and `workflow` scopes.

Comprehensive usage example:

```yml
```

You should enable `GITHUB_TOKEN` only if the repository that runs this Action is
private _and_ if `COMMITTER_TOKEN` has the `public_repo` scope only.
`GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used for verifying the SHA256 sum of the downloadable
archive for this release.


## Action inputs

Formula parameters:

* `formula-name`: the name of the Homebrew formula to bump. Defaults to
  lower-cased repository name.

* `formula-path`: the relative path of the Homebrew formula file to edit within the `homebrew-tap` repository. Defaults to
  `Formula/<formula-name>.rb`.

* `tag-name`: the git tag name to bump the formula to. Defaults to the
  currently pushed tag.

* `download-url`: the package download URL for the Homebrew formula.

  Defaults to `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/archive/<tag-name>.tar.gz`, where `OWNER/REPO` is the repository that is running the Actions workflow.

* `download-sha256`: the SHA256 checksum of the archive at `download-url`.
  Defaults to calculating the checksum by fetching the archive at run time.

Repository parameters:

* `homebrew-tap`: the full GitHub repository name (in the `NAME/OWNER` format) where the Homebrew formula should be updated. Defaults
  to `Homebrew/homebrew-core`.

* `push-to`: a specific fork of `homebrew-tap` where the edit should be pushed to. Defaults to creating or reusing a personal fork of the owner of COMMITTER_TOKEN.

* `base-branch`: the branch name in the `homebrew-tap` repository where the
  formula should be updated. Defaults to the main branch of the repository.

* `create-pullrequest`: a boolean value to either force or prohibit submitting
  a pull request to `homebrew-tap`. Defaults to false if `COMMITTER_TOKEN` has
  the privileges to directly push to `base-branch` in `homebrew-tap`.

* `commit-message`: the git commit message template to use when updating the
  formula. The following placeholders be expanded:

  | Placeholder       | Description                                        |
  | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | `{{formulaName}}` | the name of the formula supplied in `formula-name` |
  | `{{version}}`     | the version number for this release                |

  It\'s recommended that `commit-message` has _both subject and body_, i.e. that
  it contains a subject line followed by a blank line followed by body text.
  Otherwise, pull requests to `Homebrew/homebrew-core` might get denied by
  their automation.

  Defaults to:
  ```
  {{formulaName}} {{version}}

  Created by https://github.com/mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action
  ```


## How it works

Given a Homebrew formula `Formula/my_formula.rb` in the
[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) repo:

```rb
```

After we push a `v2.0.0` git tag to a project that has this action configured,
the formula will be updated to:

```rb
```

This action can update the following Homebrew formula fields:

- `version`
- `url`
- `sha256` - for non-git `download-url`
- `tag` - for git-based `download-url`
- `revision` - for git-based `download-url`

If the current `COMMITTER_TOKEN` doesn\'t have push access to the repo specified
by the `homebrew-tap` input, the formula will be edited in a fork that is
automatically created, and a pull request will be opened.

If the token has push access, but the default branch of the tap repo is
protected, a pull request will be opened from a new branch in the same repo.

Otherwise, the formula will be edited via a direct push to the default branch.
This can be overriden by setting `create-pullrequest`.


## Manual trigger

Here\'s an example of how to set up this action to be manually triggered instead
of being triggered by pushing to a git tag:

## Problem Matchers

This action registers the following [problem matchers](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/problem-matchers.md) to surface relevant information inline with changeset diffs.

* `cargo-common` matches common cases of errors and warnings
* `cargo-test` matches cargo test errors
* `cargo-fmt` matches rust format errors

To disable any or all of these you can use the `remove-matcher` directive documented [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/commands.md#problem-matchers).

297,"# Setup bazel for GitHub Actions

GitHub action to setup the bazel build tool.

This action will update the path for your workflow to include a bazel
executable matching the platform and any version requirements.

### Usage

Adding a step that uses this action to your workflow will setup bazel
and make it available to subsequent steps:

```yaml
```

### Options

There are two options for the action:

* `bazel-version` controls the version of bazel that is added to the path. This
  can be a fully specified verison `2.0.0`, partly specified `1.2`, a wildcard
  version `1.2.x`. By default it is empty which will give the latest bazel
  version available on GitHub.

  The version can also be `latest` to get the latest version of bazel on GitHub.

  The [version tests] show some expected values for given versions.

* `github-api-token` is optional, but is used to authenticate with GitHub's
  API. This will default to the generated GitHub token for the pipeline but can
  be overridden. If set to blank then no authentication is used to access the
  API and there is a chance that the test runner will have hit the API rate
  limit causing the action to fail to download the available versions from
  GitHub.

  See also:
   - [GitHub API rate limiting]
   - [GITHUB_TOKEN]


### How it works

The action will download the list of releases of bazel available on GitHub and
choose the best match for the test runner's platform and the version
requirements given as as option.  The bazel executable is then either
downloaded from GitHub, or a cached version from the action's tool cache is
used, and provided on the path for subsequent workflow steps.

298,"# Auto Approve GitHub Action

[![CI](https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Name:** `hmarr/auto-approve-action`

Automatically approve GitHub pull requests.

**Important:** use v3 or later, as v2 uses Node.js 12, which is deprecated. If you\'re on an old version of GHES (earlier than 3.4) you may need to use v2 until you can upgrade. v1 was designed for the initial GitHub Actions beta, and no longer works.

## Usage instructions

Create a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml`) that contains a step that `uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3`. Here\'s an example workflow file:

```yaml
```

Combine with an `if` clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve [Dependabot][dependabot] pull requests, use:

```yaml
```

If you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn\'t run on the `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` events, use the `pull-request-number` input:

```yaml
```

Optionally, you can provide a message for the review:

```yaml
        with:
          review-message: ""Auto approved automated PR""
```

### Approving on behalf of a different user

By default, this will use the [automatic GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) that\'s provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the ""github-actions"" bot user. Make sure you enable the `pull-requests: write` permission in your workflow.

To approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the `github-token` input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the `repo` scope enabled.

```yaml
```

### Approving Dependabot pull requests

When a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the `pull_request` event, the workflow won\'t have access to secrets. If you\'re trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why.

Fortunately the fix is simple: use the `pull_request_target` event instead of `pull_request`. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets.

## Why?

GitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it\'s occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot\'s automated pull requests to not require approval.

[dependabot]: https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot

## Code owners

If you\'re using a [CODEOWNERS file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners), you\'ll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user\'s personal access token, you\'re probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user\'s permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won\'t break when people leave the team.

## Development and release process

Each major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. `v2`, `v3`). The latest major version (`v3` at the time of writing) is the repository\'s default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. `v1.2.3`).

If using the `@semantic-release/git` plugin for protected branches, avoid persisting credentials as part of `actions/checkout@v3` by setting the parameter `persist-credentials: false`. This credential does not have the required permission to operate on protected branches.

#### Private Packages

If you are using this action to publish to the npm [GitHub Packages Registry][github-packages-registry],
then make sure that you configure this in your `package.json` file:

```json

### Inputs
|  Input Parameter  | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| semantic_version  |  false   | Specify version range for semantic-release. [[Details](#semantic_version)]                                               |
|     branches      |  false   | The branches on which releases should happen.[[Details](#branches)]<br>Support for **semantic-release above v16**.       |
|      branch       |  false   | The branch on which releases should happen.[[Details](#branch)]<br>Only support for **semantic-release older than v16**. |
|   extra_plugins   |  false   | Extra plugins for pre-install. [[Details](#extra_plugins)]                                                               |
|      dry_run      |  false   | Whether to run semantic release in `dry-run` mode. [[Details](#dry_run)]                                                 |
|        ci         |  false   | Whether to run semantic release with CI support. [[Details](#ci)]<br>Support for **semantic-release above v16**.         |
|      extends      |  false   | Use a sharable configuration [[Details](#extends)]                                                                       |
| working_directory |  false   | Use another working directory for semantic release [[Details](#working_directory)]                                       |
|     tag_format    |  false   | Specify format of tag (useful for monorepos)                                                                             |

#### semantic_version
> {Optional Input Parameter} Specify version range for semantic-release.

```yaml
```

If no version range is specified with `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3` then [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/) version [19.0.5](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/tag/v19.0.5) is used. Earlier versions of `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action` default to using the latest version of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/), so in this case it is recommended to specify version 19 or lower to avoid compatibility issues.

*Note: [Version 20.0.0](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/tag/v20.0.0) of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/) and later is currently incompatible with `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action`, since it requires Node.js 18. GitHub does not provide this environment yet for [JavaScript actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions).*

#### branches
> {Optional Input Parameter} The branches on which releases should happen.<br>`branches` supports for **semantic-release above v16**.

```yaml
```

`branches` will override the `branches` attribute in your configuration file. If the attribute is not configured on both sides, the default is:
```
```

See [configuration#branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#branches) for more information.

#### branch
> {Optional Input Parameter} Similar to parameter `branches`. The branch on which releases should happen.<br>`branch` only supports for **semantic-release older than v16**.

```yaml
```

It will override the `branch` attribute in your configuration file. If the attribute is not configured on both sides, the default is `master`.

#### extra_plugins
> {Optional Input Parameter} Extra plugins for pre-install.

The action can be used with `extra_plugins` option to specify plugins which are not in the [default list of plugins of semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/plugins#default-plugins). When using this option, please make sure that these plugins are also mentioned in your [semantic release config\'s plugins](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#plugins) array.

For example, if you want to use `@semantic-release/git` and `@semantic-release/changelog` extra plugins, these must be added to `extra_plugins` in your actions file and `plugins` in your [release config file](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file) as shown bellow:

Github Action Workflow:
```yaml
```

Similar to parameter `semantic_version`. *It is recommended to manually specify a version of semantic-release plugins to prevent errors caused.*

Release Config:
```diff
```

#### dry_run
> {Optional Input Parameter} Whether to run semantic release in `dry-run` mode.<br>It will override the dryRun attribute in your configuration file.

```yaml
```

#### ci
> {Optional Input Parameter} Whether to run semantic release with CI support (default true).<br>`ci` supports for **semantic-release above v16**.

```yaml
```

`ci` can be used, e.g in combination with `dry_run` when generating the next release version in pull requests, where `semantic_release` would normally block the execution.

#### extends
The action can be used with `extends` option to extend an existing [sharable configuration](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/shareable-configurations) of semantic-release. Can be used in combination with `extra_plugins`.

```yaml
```

#### working_directory
This action run semantic release in the github provided workspace by default. You can override it by setting another working directory.

```yaml
```

#### tag_format
The default tag format on semantic-release is `v{version}`. You can override that behavior using this option (helpful when you are using monorepos)

```yaml
```

## Usage

You can use it as a Github Action like this:

```yaml
```

_to use a specific level:_
```diff
```

_to install dev dependencies:_
```diff
```

_to skip checking the platform requirements:_
```diff
```

to use a `phpstan.neon.dist` configuration file, just drop the `phpstan.neon.dist`
in your repository root and it will be taken into account.


**You can copy/paste the .github folder (under examples/) to your project and thats all!**

### Usage Example
Place the following in `/.github/workflows/main.yml`
```yml
```

---

### Requirements
- You must have ftp access to your server. If your host allows or requires ssh please use my [web-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/web-deploy) action
- Some web hosts change the default port (21), check with your host for your port number

---

### Setup Steps
1. Select the repository you want to add the action to
2. Select the `Actions` tab
3. Select `Blank workflow file` or `Set up a workflow yourself`, if you don\'t see these options manually create a yaml file `Your_Project/.github/workflows/main.yml`
4. Paste the example above into your yaml file and save
5. Now you need to add a key to the `secrets` section in your project. To add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`. Add a new `Secret` for `password`
6. Update your yaml file settings
7. If you appreciate this github action give it a :star: or show off with one of the [badges below](#badge).

---

### Settings
Keys can be added directly to your .yml config file or referenced from your project `Secrets` storage.

To add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`.
I strongly recommend you store your `password` as a secret.

# Common Examples
#### Build and Publish React/Angular/Vue Website
Make sure you have an npm script named \'build\'. This config should work for most node built websites.

```yml
```

#### FTPS
```yml
```

#### Log only dry run: Use this option for testing
Ouputs a list of files that will be created/modified to sync your source without making any actual changes
```yml
```

#### Exclude files
Excludes files
```yml
```

`exclude` has the following default value
```yml
```

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>How to exclude .git files from the publish</summary>

Git files are excluded by default! If you customize the `exclude` option make sure you re-add the default options.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to exclude a specific file or folder</summary>

You can use the `exclude` option to ignore specific files/folders from the publish. Keep in mind you will need to re-add the default exclude options if you want to keep them. For example the below option excludes all `.txt` files.

```yml
```

## Debugging your config locally
This action is a basic wrapper around my `@samkirkland/ftp-deploy` npm package. To test your config you can install [@samkirkland/ftp-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/ftp-deploy) and then convert your config to a yml action. Settings are one-to-one, this action is only a wrapper.

## Contributing to this project
To test this action locally you will need to setup **docker** and **act** to run a environment similar to the one github uses for actions.
- Download/install docker for windows, make sure it is running
- `choco install act-cli` install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- Install the npm package using `npm install --dev-only @samkirkland/ftp-deploy`
- Update the `deploy` script in `package.json` with a actual server/username/password
- You can run the script using the following command `npm run deploy` (run this in the folder that has the `package.json` file)

# [The **get-cmake** action installs as fast as possible your desired versions of CMake and Ninja](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake)
The action restores from local or cloud based cache both CMake and Ninja. If a `cache-miss` occurs, it downloads and caches the tools right away.

Works for `x64` and `arm64` hosts on Linux, macOS and Windows.

The desired version can be specified using [semantic versioning ranges](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning), and also use `install` or `installrc` special tokens to install resp. the [latest stable](./.latest_cmake_version) or [release candidate](./.latestrc_cmake_version).

There are two kind of caches:
- The cloud based [GitHub cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache). Enabled by default, it can be disabled using the input `useCloudCache:false`. 
- The local self-hosted runner cache, stored locally using [tool-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/tool-cache). Disabled by default, it can enabled with the input `useLocalCache:true`. 


Steps of `get-cmake`:
  1. If a `cache-hit` occurs (either local or cloud cache), CMake and Ninja are restored from the cache.
     1. if both local and cloud are enabled, the local cache check goes first.
  2. If a `cache-miss` occurs, i.e. none of the enabled caches hits:
     1. the action downloads and installs the desired versions of CMake and Ninja.
     2. the action stores CMake and Ninja for the enabled caches:
        1. if enabled, on the [cloud based GitHub cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache). This is beneficial for the next run of the workflow especially on _GitHub-hosted runners_.
        2. if enabled, on the local GitHub runner cache. This is beneficial for the next run of the workflow on the same _self-hosted runner_.
        
        _Note:_ when there is a `cache-hit`, nothing will be stored in any of the caches.
  3. Adds to the `PATH` environment variable the binary directories for CMake and Ninja.
  
<br>

## Quickstart
### If you want to use  **latest stable** you can use this one-liner:
```yaml
```
The local and cloud cache can be enabled or disabled, for example:
```yaml
```
And there is a second option:
```yaml
```

<br>

### If you want to **pin** the workflow to **specific range of versions** of CMake and Ninja:
```yaml
```
or there is another option:
```yaml
```

# Quickstart with a C++ project template

Take a look at this [C++ project template](https://github.com/lukka/CppCMakeVcpkgTemplate) that applies all the following instructions and also shows how to create a __pure__ workflow without using special GitHub action that you cannot run locally on your development machine, but directly using the tools (`CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg`, `C++` compilers) you already use daily.

# [**run-cmake@v10** runs CMake with CMakePresets.json](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake)

The **run-cmake** action runs [CMake](https://cmake.org) on GitHub workflows leveraging [CMakePresets.json](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html). Note that usage of CMakePresets.json is required.

Good companions are the [run-vcpkg](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg) action and the [get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) action.

Special features which provide added value over a pure workflow are:
  - annotations for `CMake` errors/warnings and for build (`gcc`/`msvc`/`clang`) errors/warnings are created inline in the changed source files the build run for, e.g.:  
    ![Annotation](./docs/imgs/annotation.png)
  - when necessary, it sets up the environment to build with the `MSVC` toolset.
  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. The regex is customizable by the user.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

<br>

## Quickstart with instructions

It is __highly recommended__ to use:
- a [vcpkg.json](https://vcpkg.io/en/docs/maintainers/manifest-files.html) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.
- the required [CMakePresets.json](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) file.
- [vcpkg as a submodule of your repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/README.md#vcpkg-as-a-submodule).

![social preview](social-preview.png)

This action sets by perl environment for use in actions by:

- optionally downloading and caching a version of perl
- registering problem matchers for error output 

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

Basic:
```yaml
```

Install CPAN Modules from cpanfile and cache them:
```yaml
```

Matrix Testing:
```yaml
```

## Use Strawberry Perl on Windows

actions-setup-perl uses the binaries customized for GitHub Actions by default.
If you want to use [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) on Windows, add `distribution: strawberry` into the ""with"" section.

```yaml
```

This option is available on Windows and falls back to the default customized binaries on other platforms.

### Supported Platforms

The action works for [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

| Operating System | Supported Versions |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |
| macOS | `macos-11`, `macos-12` |
| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |

[Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) are not supported.

## Action inputs

All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

### `perl-version`

Specifies the Perl version to setup.
Minor version and patch level can be omitted.
The action uses the latest Perl version available that matches the specified value.
This defaults to `5`, which results in the latest available version of Perl 5.
In addition, the value `latest` is available, the actions uses the latest available version of Perl including `5`, `7` or later major versions.

### `perl-version-file`

Specifies the path to the version file such as `.perl-version`.

### `distribution`

Specify the distribution to use, this is either `default` or `strawberry`. (The value `strawberry` is ignored on anything but Windows.)

- Default: `default`

### `multi-thread`

Enables interpreter-based threads (ithread) options (`-Duseithreads`). `true` and `false` are accepted.

- Default: depends on platform. On Linux and macOS, the default value is ""false"" (ithread is disabled). On Windows, the default value is ""true"" (ithread is enable) for fork emulation.

### `install-modules-with`

Install CPAN modules from your `cpanfile` with the specified installer.
`cpanm`([App::cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus)), `cpm`([App::cpm](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpm)), and `carton`([Carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton)) are available.
CPAN modules is installed into `${working-directory}/local/`.

- Default: Nothing. Any CPAN module is not installed.

### `install-modules-args`

The argument for CPAN module installer.

- Default: Nothing

### `install-modules`

List of one or more CPAN modules, separated by white spaces (space or new line).
They are installed `local` directory on your working directory.

- Default: Nothing

### `enable-modules-cache`

Enable caching of the `local` directory at the root of the working directory. `true` enables the cache and `false` disables it.
The cache key will be generated by hashing the contents of `cpanfile` in the repository root.
This is intended for preserving locally installed modules between builds, which reduces build times.
See [Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) for more information.

**Warning:** If your repository does not use a `cpanfile` or if it uses a
subdirectory named `local` for a different purpose, you probably want to set
this option to `false` to prevent old files from being cached unexpectedly
between builds.

- Default: `true`

### `working-directory`

The working directory.

- Default: `.`

## Action outputs

### `perl-version`

The perl version actually installed. (e.g. `""5.34.0""`)

### `perl-hash`

The digest of `perl -V`.
It is useful for the cache key, because this value vary the platform, the version of perl, the compiler option for building perl, etc.

# Supported Shells

The GitHub runner come with a preinstalled version of Perl, used by the system Git. Unfortunately, some shell types prepend the directory containing the system Perl to the `PATH` which makes it impossible to use the Perl installed by this action.

`shell` parameter | Linux | macOS | Windows (default) | Windows (Strawberry)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`bash` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:<sup>1)</sup> | :x:<sup>1)</sup>
`pwsh` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
`python` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
`sh` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | n/a | n/a
`cmd` | n/a | n/a | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
`powershell` | n/a |  n/a | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
custom shell `perl {0}` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:

1) On Windows, the bash shell always gets `/usr/bin` prepended to the `PATH` which contains the system Perl.

# Pre-installed Scripts

The following Perl scripts are pre-installed for convenience.

# SpotBugs GitHub Action

This action pushes results from [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) (or [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)) as check run annotations. :rocket:

The action can also be used for any other static analysis tools that produce reports in the SpotBugs XML format.
The report itself must be generated in a former build step, for example a Maven build.

![example](images/example.png)

## Input

### `path`
Required. A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes where to find the reports.
Multiple files can be processed through a [glob expression](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob), for example: `'**/spotbugsXml.xml'`.

### `name`
Optional. Name for the check run to create. Defaults to `spotbugs`.

### `title`
Optional. Title for the check run to create. Defaults to `SpotBugs Source Code Analyzer report`.

### `token`
Optional. GitHub API access token. Defaults to `${{ github.token }}`, which is set by `actions/checkout@v2` minimally.

## Example usage

```yaml
```

And do not forget to enable XML output for the Maven plugin:

```xml
```

Please note that by default workflows on `pull_request` events checkout [`refs/pull/:prNumber/merge`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) instead of the head of the pull request.
Due to this, line numbers for the generated violations may not align with the actual line numbers to which they are displayed on the `HEAD`.
As it is, there is not really a sensible way to run this action on the merge commit of the pull request, because the result would be posted to an unnamed workflow for an otherwise invisible commit.
Even for `pull_request` events there is the possibility to checkout the pull request head instead. In order to do so, change your `checkout` action accordingly:

```yaml
```

## Other relevant actions
This is a Github Action in a series of other GitHub Actions. Similar actions include:

* [checkstyle-github-action](https://github.com/jwgmeligmeyling/checkstyle-github-action)
* [pmd-github-action](https://github.com/jwgmeligmeyling/pmd-github-action)
* [spotbugs-github-action](https://github.com/jwgmeligmeyling/spotbugs-github-action)

## Known limitations
Due to GitHub API limitations, we cannot specify to which Workflow Run (or underlying Check Suite) a newly created Check Run should be associated.
As a result, workflows that trigger on several types of events, might push results under another event than the action was run in.
For more information, see: https://github.com/jwgmeligmeyling/spotbugs-github-action/issues/3

310,"# @check-spelling/check-spelling GitHub Action

## Overview

Everyone makes typos. This includes people writing documentation and comments,
but it also includes programmers naming variables, functions, APIs, classes,
and filenames.

Often, programmers will use `InitialCapitalization`, `camelCase`,
`ALL_CAPS`, or `IDLCase` when naming their things. When they do this, it makes
it much harder for naive spelling tools to recognize misspellings, and as such,
with a really high false-positive rate, people don\'t tend to enable spell checking
at all.

This repository\'s tools are capable of tolerating all of those variations.
Specifically, [w](https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/master/w) understands
enough about how programmers name things that it can split the above conventions
into word-like things for checking against a dictionary.

This action sets up a Zing java environment for use in actions by:

- Downloading and caching a requested version of java by version and adding to PATH. Downloads are populated from the [Zing distribution CDN](https://cdn.azul.com/zing/releases/tgz/)
- registering problem matchers for error output

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
```
Examples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:

- A major Java version

  e.g. ```7, 8, 11, ...```
 
- A semver Java version specification

  e.g. ```8.0.252, 7.0.262, 11.0.7```
  
  e.g. ```8.0.x, >7.0.212, >=11.0.1, <8.0.262```
  
- 1.x syntax

    e.g. ```1.8``` (same as ```8```)
    
    e.g. ```1.8.0.252``` (same as ```8.0.252```)

## Matrix Testing
```yaml
```

## Publishing using Apache Maven
```yaml
```

The two `settings.xml` files created from the above example look like the following.

`settings.xml` file created for the first deploy to GitHub Packages
```xml
```

`settings.xml` file created for the second deploy to Apache Maven Central
```xml
```

***NOTE: The `settings.xml` file is created in the Actions $HOME directory. If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***

If `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner\'s temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.

## Publishing using Gradle
```yaml
```

***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***

See the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.

## Apache Maven with a settings path

When using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file. Setting the `settings-path` variable allows you to choose a unique location for your settings file.

```yaml
```

312,"# GitHub Action - Releases API
This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Create a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to create releases.

<a href=""https://github.com/actions/create-release""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/create-release/workflows/Tests/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

- `tag_name`: The name of the tag for this release
- `release_name`: The name of the release
- `body`: Text describing the contents of the release
- `draft`: `true` to create a draft (unpublished) release, `false` to create a published one. Default: `false`
- `prerelease`: `true` to identify the release as a prerelease. `false` to identify the release as a full release. Default `false`

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The release ID
- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`
- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action

### Example workflow - create a release
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):

```yaml
```

This will create a [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases), as well as a [`release` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#releaseevent), which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action. This uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by the [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret), so no new token is needed.

# Blazing fast GitHub Pages deploy

> \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 The most blazingest action to deploy your GitHub pages website


## Why did you make another action to deploy to GitHub pages?

This GitHub action uses JavaScript for maximum speed \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80.
> Using a [JavaScript action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action. 


## Usage

1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to your project.
2. Create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
3. [Create a secret](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) containing the personal access token, call it `GH_PAT`
4. Modify the [workflow options](#workflow-options) for your project

Here is an example `deploy.yml` file:

```yml
```


## Workflow options

If you want a more custom experience you can add these values. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

| Setting | Description | Default value | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `repo-token` | The personal access token | `${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}` | `true` |
| `site-directory` | The site directory | `_site` | `false` |
| `commit-message` | The commit message for the branch | Deployed using Blazing fast GitHub Pages deploy action | `false` |
| `deploy-branch` | The branch to deploy the built website to | `gh-pages` | `false` |


## Troubleshooting

> ""could not read Username for \'https://github.com\': No such device or address""

This is due to the deployed site folder containing a `.git` directory. It is recommended to build the site in a new folder for deployment.

320,"# GitHub Project Automation+

> \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96 Automate GitHub Project cards with any webhook event

This action allows you to use any of the [pull_request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request) and [issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues-event-issues) webhook events to automate your project cards. For example when an `issue` is `opened` create a card in the Backlog project, Triage column.

If the `pull_request` or `issue` card already exists it will be moved to the column provided. Otherwise the card will be created in the column.


## Usage

Create a [project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) with columns in your repository, user profile or organisation.

Create a new workflow `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. In the `.yml`file you have to decide what webhook events going move or create a card in a column. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file). See the examples below to get started quickly.


### .github/workflows/opened-issues-triage.yml

Move opened issues into the Triage column of the Backlog project

```yml
```

### .github/workflows/assigned-pulls-todo.yml

Add assigned pull requests into the To Do column of the Backlog project

```yml
```

## Workflow options

Change these options in the workflow `.yml` file to meet your GitHub project needs.

| Inputs | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `on` | When the automation is ran | `issues` `pull_request` `issue_comment` `pull_request_target` `pull_request_review` |
| `types` | The types of activity that will trigger a workflow run. | `opened`, `assigned`, `edited`: [See GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) for more |
| `project` | The name of the project | `Backlog` |
| `column` | The column to create or move the card to | `Triage` |
| `repo-token` | The personal access token | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |
| `action` | This determines the type of the action to be performed on the card, Default: `update` | `update`, `delete`, `archive`, `add` |

## Personal access token

Most of the time [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) will work as your `repo-token`. This requires no set up. If you have a public project board and public repository this is the option for you.

**Repository project, private repository or organisation projects**

You will need a personal access token to send events from your issues and pull requests.

1. Create a personal access token
    1. [Public repository and repository project](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)
    1. [Private repository or private project](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)
    1. [Organisation project board or organisation repository](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,write:org&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)

1. [Add a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) `GHPROJECT_TOKEN` with the personal access token.
1. Update the `repo-token` in the workflow `.yml`  to reference your new token name:
```yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

**GraphqlError: Resource not accessible by integration** or **Secrets are not currently available to forks.**

This error happens on repository projects and forked repositories because [`GITHUB_TOKEN` only has read permissions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token). Create a personal access token following the instructions above.

**Parameter token or opts.auth is required**

This error happens when using a personal access token to run the workflow on PRs from forked repositories. This is because [GitHub secrets are not populated for workflows triggered by forks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories-2). Use `pull_request_target` as the webhook event instead to [enable access to secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).

**SAML enforcement**

With certain organisations there may be SAML enforcement. This means you will need to `Enable SSO` when you create the personal access token.
```
```

**Can't read repository null**

Make sure your permissions for your personal access token are correctly configured. Follow the above [guide on permissions](#personal-access-token).

**Private repositories**

You may need to enable policy settings to allow running workflows from forks. Please refer to GitHub's documentation to learn about enabling these settings at [enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise-account/enforcing-github-actions-policies-in-your-enterprise-account#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks), [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization?algolia-query=private+repositor#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks), or [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) level.

322,"# Composer action

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nick-zh/composer)](https://github.com/nick-zh/composer/blob/master/LICENSE)  

## Description
Github action for using [composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) in your workflows. The action comes with [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo) preinstalled.  
Uses the new YML syntax.

## Versions
## Supported versions
`php7.4`: Based on `php:7.4-cli-alpine` with [composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) and [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo)  
`php7.3`: Based on `php:7.3-cli-alpine` with [composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) and [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo)  

### Deprecated versions
`0.2.0` uses a pre-built docker image [composer-prestissimo](https://github.com/nick-zh/docker-composer-prestissimo) (basing on the official composer image).
This improves build time (is now around 13s), since now the action only needs to pull instead of building it every time.  

`0.1.1` uses the the offical [composer docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) directly and installs [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo).  
Due to this, the image is freshly built everytime (roughly 31s).

325,"# Nightly Merge Action

Automatically merge the stable branch into the development one.

If the merge is not necessary, the action will do nothing.
If the merge fails due to conflicts, the action will fail, and the repository
maintainer should perform the merge manually.

## Installation

To enable the action simply create the `.github/workflows/nightly-merge.yml`
file with the following content:

```yml
```

Even though this action was created to run as a scheduled workflow,
[`on`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)
can be replaced by any other trigger.

For example, this will run the action whenever something is pushed on the
`master` branch:

```yml
```

This will add a button to the action to trigger it manually:

```yml
```

## Parameters

### `stable_branch`

The name of the stable branch (default `master`).

### `development_branch`

The name of the development branch (default `devel`).

### `allow_ff`

Allow fast forward merge (default `false`). If not enabled, merges will use
`--no-ff`.

### `allow_git_lfs`

Allow support for repositories that use `git lfs` (default `false`). 

### `ff_only`

Refuse to merge and exit unless the current HEAD is already up to date or the
merge can be resolved as a fast-forward (default `false`).
Requires `allow_ff=true`.

### `allow_forks`

Allow action to run on forks (default `false`).

### `user_name`

User name for git commits (default `GitHub Nightly Merge Action`).

### `user_email`

User email for git commits (default `actions@github.com`).

### `push_token`

Environment variable containing the token to use for push (default
`GITHUB_TOKEN`).
Useful for pushing on protected branches.
Using a secret to store this variable value is strongly recommended, since this
value will be printed in the logs.
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still used for API calls, therefore both token should be
available.

```yml
```

# Icinga 2 - Docker image

This image integrates [Icinga 2] into your [Docker] environment.

## Usage

```bash
```

The container may listen on port 5665 and expects
a volume on `/data` and a specific persistent hostname.
To configure it, do one of the following:

* Run the node wizard as usual. It will store all data in `/data`.
  Hint: `docker run --rm -it -h icinga-master -v icinga-master:/data icinga/icinga2 icinga2 node wizard`
* Provide configuration files, certificates, etc.
  in `/data/etc/icinga2` and `/data/var/...` by yourself.
  Consult the [Icinga 2 configuration documentation]
  on which configuration files there are.
* Provide environment variables as shown above.

To notify by e-mail, provide an [msmtp configuration] - either
by mounting the `/etc/msmtprc` file or by specifying the desired content
of `~icinga/.msmtprc` via the environment variable `MSMTPRC`.

**Don\'t mount volumes under `/data/etc/icinga2` or `/data/var/*/icinga2`**
unless `/data` already contains all of these directories!
Otherwise `/data` will stay incomplete, i.e. broken.

### Environment variables

Most of the following variables correspond to
`icinga2 node setup` CLI parameters.
If any of these is present and `icinga2 node setup`
has not been run yet, it will run.
Consult the [node setup command documentation] on what are which parameters for.

Regular variables:

 `ICINGA_ZONE=master`                                     | `--zone master`

Special variables:

* `ICINGA_TRUSTEDCERT`\'s value is written to a temporary file
  which is passed to `icinga2 node setup` via `--trustedcert`.
* `ICINGA_CACERT`\'s value is written to `/var/lib/icinga2/certs/ca.crt`.

328,"## AWS CodeBuild Run Build for GitHub Actions

This action runs a [AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] [project][codebuild project]
as a step in a GitHub Actions workflow job.

The action builds the CodeBuild project, collects the build logs, and prints them as they are written.
The user experience is the same as it would be if the logic were executed
in the GitHub Actions job runner.

[Security issue notifications](./CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications)

## Usage

### Inputs

This action offers three inputs that you can use to configure its behavior.
The only required input is `project-name`.

1. **project-name** (required) : The name of CodeBuild project you want to run.
1. **buildspec-override** (optional) :
   The location (in this repository) of the [buildspec file][codebuild buildspec]
   that CodeBuild requires.
   By default, the action uses the buildspec file location
   that you configured in the CodeBuild project. 
  
   Alternatively, you can pass in an inline buildspec definition like so:

   ```
   - name: Run CodeBuild
     uses: aws-actions/aws-codebuild-run-build@v1
     with:
       project-name: my-codebuild-job
       disable-source-override: true
       buildspec-override:   |
         version: 0.2
         phases:
           install:
             runtime-versions:
               nodejs: 16
             commands:
               - npm install -g typescript
               - npm install
           pre_build:
             commands:
               - echo Installing source NPM dependencies...
           build:
             commands:
               - echo Build started on `date`
               - tsc
               - npm prune --production
             post_build:
               commands:
                 - echo Build completed on `date`  
         artifacts:
           type: zip
           files:
             - package.json
             - package-lock.json
   ```
1. **compute-type-override** (optional) :
   The name of a compute type for this build that overrides the one specified
   in the build project.
1. **environment-type-override** (optional) :
   A container type for this build that overrides the one specified in the
   build project.
1. **image-override** (optional) :
   The name of an image for this build that overrides the one specified
   in the build project.
1. **disable-source-override** (optional) :
   Set to `true` if you want to disable providing `sourceVersion`,
   `sourceTypeOverride` and `sourceLocationOverride` to CodeBuild.
1. **env-vars-for-codebuild** (optional) :
   A comma-separated list of the names of environment variables
   that the action passes from GitHub Actions to CodeBuild.

   The action passes these environment variables to CodeBuild
   along with any environment variables that have a `github` prefix.

   This list is often the same or a subset of the list of environment variables
   that you define for GitHub actions in the `env` property.

   Note: If you specify an environment variable
   with the same name as one defined in your CodeBuild project,
   the one defined here replaces the one in the CodeBuild project.
   For a list of CodeBuild environment variables, see

1. **update-interval** (optional) :
   Update interval as seconds for how often the API is called to check on the status.

   A higher value mitigates the chance of hitting API rate-limiting especially when
   running many instances of this action in parallel, but also introduces a larger
   potential time overhead (ranging from 0 to update interval) for the action to
   fetch the build result and finish.

   Lower value limits the potential time overhead worst case but it may hit the API
   rate-limit more often, depending on the use-case.

   The default value is 30.

1. **update-back-off** (optional) :
   Base back-off time in seconds for the update interval.

   When API rate-limiting is hit the back-off time, augmented with jitter, will be
   added to the next update interval.
   E.g. with update interval of 30 and back-off time of 15, upon hitting the rate-limit
   the next interval for the update call will be 30 + random*between(0, 15 * 2 \\*\\* 0))
   seconds and if the rate-limit is hit again the next interval will be
   30 + random*between(0, 15 * 2 \\*\\* 1) and so on.

   The default value is 15.

1. **hide-cloudwatch-logs** (optional) :
   Set to `true` if you do not want CloudWatch Logs to be streamed to GitHub Action.

### Outputs

1. **aws-build-id** : The CodeBuild build ID of the build that the action ran.

## Purpose

This action is designed to give you the power of GitHub Actions
with options available in [AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] for more CPU and memory,
and access to other resources.

GitHub Actions provides a powerful system of event-based workflows,
but the hosted job runners cannot exceed the defined computing and memory limits,
and might prevent you from accessing resources that you need for your project.

[AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] is a fully managed continuous integration service
that can compile source code, run tests, and produce software packages that are ready to deploy.
It supports more environment options than standard GitHub Actions,
including a selection of powerful computing environments with additional memory.

### Resources and Architecture

[GitHub Actions job runners][github actions job runners] have 2 x86_64 CPU cores and 7 GB RAM.

This is enough for the most common activities,
but some large or complex builds need more resources,
and some builds need access to special CPU architectures or hardware.

[CodeBuild compute types][codebuild compute types] offer options including:

- up to 72 x86_64 vCPUs
- up to 255 GB RAM
- up to 8 ARM64 vCPUs
- GPU hardware devices

### Access

Your workflow might require access to assets, configuration, or resources
that are impossible, difficult, or simply expensive
to access from GitHub\'s hosted job runners
but are easy or cheap to access from CodeBuild.

## Credentials and Permissions

In order for the action to run your CodeBuild project,
you need to provide AWS credentials.
We recommend using [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials]
to configure your credentials for a job.

**NOTE:
GitHub Secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository.
This means that you cannot use this action directly in a workflow
that is triggered by pull requests from a fork.
See the [GitHub Secrets docs][github secrets access] for more information.**

The credentials that you provide need to have the following permissions:

- `codebuild:StartBuild`
- `codebuild:BatchGetBuilds`
- `logs:GetLogEvents`

For example:

```json
```

## Examples

These examples show how you can define a step in a workflow job.
For more information about GitHub Actions workflow syntax,
see the [GitHub docs][github workflow syntax].

If your CodeBuild project is already configured the way you want it,
the only CodeBuild Run input you need to provide is the project name.

```yaml
```

If you reuse a project in multiple jobs or repositories,
you might want to provide a bit more configuration.
For example, the following configuration
specifies an alternate location for the buildspec file.
It also tells AWS CodeBuild Run Build
to send all of the environment variables defined in the `env:` list to CodeBuild.
If any of these environment variables are defined in the CodeBuild project,
this will overwrite them.

```yaml
    buildspec-override: path/to/buildspec.yaml or inline buildspec definition
    compute-type-override: compute-type
    environment-type-override: environment-type
    image-override: ecr-image-uri
    env-vars-for-codebuild: |
      custom,
      requester,
      event-name
  env:
    custom: my environment variable
    requester: ${{ github.actor }}
    event-name: ${{ github.event_name }}
```

### Running Locally

It can be useful to run a build outside of CI.
So, this action can also be installed locally
to kick off a CodeBuild project from your git sandbox.
You could push your changes to an open PR,
but if you only want to test one project this may be faster.
In order to use this tool,
you must first `git checkout` the commit that you want to test.

```
```

This will use whatever commit you have checked out
and push to a temporary branch in the specified remote.
Then kick off the build
and delete the remote branch when complete.

You can also install the project globally or locally
and execute it that way.

## Implementation Notes

### What we did

We call the [CodeBuild `StartBuild` API][codebuild startbuild],
checking out the commit that triggered the workflow.

The action waits for the build to complete while logging everything written to the build\'s
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs][cloudwatch logs] [logstream][cloudwatch logs concepts].
If the `buildStatus` value in the StartBuild response is `SUCCEEDED`, the action succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails.

In the call to StartBuild, we pass in all
`GITHUB_` [environment variables][github environment variables] in the GitHub Actions environment,
plus any environment variables that you specified in the `env-passthrough` input value.

By default, regardless of the project configuration in CodeBuild or GitHub Actions,
we always pass the following parameters and values to CodeBuild in the StartBuild API call.

| CodeBuild value          | GitHub value                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `sourceVersion`          | The commit that triggered the workflow |
| `sourceTypeOverride`     | The string `\'GITHUB\'`                  |
| `sourceLocationOverride` | The `HTTPS` git url for `context.repo` |

If you want to disable sending the parameters `sourceVersion`, `sourceTypeOverride` and `sourceLocationOverride` you can use `disable-source-override` input.

### What we did not do

This action intentionally does not let you specify every option
in the [CodeBuild::StartBuild][codebuild startbuild] API.

Because all GitHub Actions input values are passed through environment variables,
they must be simple strings.
This makes it difficult to pass complex structures as inputs.

Also, providing an input for every parameter in the `StartBuild` API
would have made it much more difficult to use and maintain this tool.
We would have to add many more inputs or require string values,
while hoping that all supported configurations
conformed to the environment variable length limits.

For this reason, and to simplify what we expect to be the most common use-cases,
we chose to start with the simplest possible configuration.
If you find that these options don\'t meet your needs, please open an issue to let us know.

## Release Process

By creating a new Release a workflow is triggered creating a new commit which only contains `dist` and the `action.yml`. The necessary tags, i.e. for the release v1.0.7, the tag v1.0.7 is created and the v1.0 and v1 tags are updated.

For the tagging and building the [build-and-tag](https://github.com/JasonEtco/build-and-tag-action) action by [Jason Etcovitch](https://github.com/JasonEtco) is used. It expects to have the main attribute and a build script to be set in the `package.json`. It then builds the code with the ncc compiler and creates the new tag/ updates existing tags for minor and major versions automatically.

330,"# ITK Apply clang-format Action

This GitHub Action applies clang-format on a PR when requested by adding the
label *action:ApplyClangFormat*.

The bot will run `clang-format` on the current topic branch with ITK's
configuration, force-push the result, and remove the label.

*Note*: As of 2020-01-08, this action [currently does not work from forked
repositories](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Token-permissions-for-forks-once-again/td-p/33839)
because the [*GITHUB_TOKEN* has limited
permissions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token). Branches need to be created on the upstream repository.

## Usage

Add the following configuration to your project's repository at, e.g.,  *.github/workflows/apply-clang-format.yml*.

```yml
```

To change the name of the label used to trigger the formatting, set the
*label-name* input. For example:

```yml
```

Detailed documentation
========================

Other than the brief introduction in this page, you can also check `the detailed doc here <./doc/index.rst>`__.

Introduction
============

This package contains `CI (Continuous Integration) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`__ scripts that any ROS-powered packages can commonly use.
Some notable feature:

* Checks if your package builds, installs without issues. If unit/system tests are defined run them. `ROS Prerelease Test <http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest>`__ can optionally be run.
* Proven to cover the general requirements of the ROS-based robotics repositories. Easily configurable.
* Users can add custom pre/post processes.
* Covers ROS1 Indigo, Jade, Kinetic, Lunar, Melodic, Noetic and ROS2 distributions.
* This repo provides scripts for `Bitbucket CI`, `Gitlab CI`, `GitHub Actions` and `Travis CI` only, but it can be easily adapted for other CI services.

For a brief overall introduction, you could also check a presentation:

* `ROS-Industrial community meeting <http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/6/14/ros-i-community-web-meeting-june-2016>`__

Quick Start
============

With a few steps, you can start in your client repository using CI confiurations stored in `industrial_ci`.

For Travis CI
--------------

1. Activate CI for your github repository on `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.com/>`__).

   a) You may do so either at https://travis-ci.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION or at https://travis-ci.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_USER (depending on where your repository sits).
   b) Activate CI beta for your bitbucket repository is similar, but the target link that your status badge directs to needs to be modified from https://travis-ci.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME to https://travis-ci.com/bitbucket/USERNAME/REPO_NAME. By default, the generated link directs to a github repository.

2. Add `.travis.yml` file to your repository root (`complete template <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/blob/master/doc/.travis.yml>`__):

::

  language: generic
  services:
    - docker

  env:
    matrix:
      - ROS_DISTRO=""indigo""

  install:
    - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci.git .industrial_ci -b master
  script:
    - .industrial_ci/travis.sh

* Note: The name `.industrial_ci` is NO longer REQUIRED for the cloned folder starting version 0.3.2; you can pick any name (recommended practice to keep the folder hidden (by prepending ""."").

For Gitlab CI
-------------

1. Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to `official doc <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/>`__ for the steps to do so. Note for Gitlab CI, necessary steps might be different between hosted version (i.e. the one on gitlab.com) v.s. the one on your own server, which Gitlab doesn\'t always clarify in its documentation.

   1. For your server version, enable a runner for your Gitlab project which uses the Docker executor. See instructions on how to `install <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html>`__ and `register <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html>`__ such a runner with your Gitlab instance if you haven\'t done so yet.

2. In `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:

::

   image: docker:git
   services:
     - docker:dind
   before_script:
     - apk add --update bash coreutils tar
     - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master
   indigo:
     script: .industrial_ci/gitlab.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo


For Bitbucket Pipelines
-----------------------

1. Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to `official doc <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines-792298921.html>`__ for the steps to do so.
2. In the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:

::

   image: docker:git

   pipelines:
     default:
        - step:
            services:
              - docker
            script:
              - apk add --update bash coreutils tar
              - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master
              - .industrial_ci/bitbucket.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo

   definitions:
     services:
       docker:
         memory: 2048


For GitHub Actions
-----------------------

1. Create `.github/workflows/industrial_ci_action.yml` (industrial_ci_action.yml is arbitrary, `complete template <doc/industrial_ci_action.yml>`__)  with the following configuration, (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing melodic for your chosen distro:

::

   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     industrial_ci:
       strategy:
         matrix:
           env:
             - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: testing}
             - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: main}
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - uses: \'ros-industrial/industrial_ci@master\'
           env: ${{matrix.env}}

For Google Cloud Build
----------------------
1. Connect your source code repository to your Google Cloud Project. Please refer to the `official documentation <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers#gcloud>`__ for the steps to do so.
2. In the `cloudbuild.yaml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration

::

  steps:
    - name: \'ros:melodic\'
      entrypoint: \'bash\'
      args:
        - \'-c\'
        - |-
          git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master
          .industrial_ci/ci.sh
      env:
        - \'ISOLATION=shell\'
        - \'CI=true\'

Concrete examples of config files
-------------------------------------

- A `template for Travis CI <doc/.travis.yml>`__.
- For development branch intended for ROS Indigo: `ros_canopen <https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros_canopen/blob/0a42bf181804167834b8dc3b80bfca971f24546f/.travis.yml>`__

- For Gitlab CI, a small `sample config <./.gitlab-ci.yml>`__.

Metrics
========

There might not an easy way to precisely count how many repositories out there are using `industrial_ci`. Counting that number isn\'t even our priority at all, but we\'re often simply curious. Here\'s some ways that give us some clues for the usage metrics:

- `Searching Github repos that contain string industrial_ci <https://github.com/search?p=1&q=industrial_ci+-repo%3Aros-industrial%2Findustrial_ci&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93>`__) (with some duplicates. Excluding industrial_ci repo):

</p>

A GitHub Action for installing, configuring and running hardware-accelerated Android Emulators on macOS virtual machines.

The old ARM-based emulators were slow and are no longer supported by Google. The modern Intel Atom (x86 and x86_64) emulators can be fast, but rely on two forms of hardware acceleration to reach their peak potential: [Graphics Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-graphics), e.g. `emulator -gpu host` and [Virtual Machine(VM) Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-vm), e.g. `emulator -accel on`. **Note:** GPU and VM Acceleration are two different and non-mutually exclusive forms of Hardware Acceleration.

This presents a challenge when running emulators on CI especially when running emulators within a docker container, because **Nested Virtualization** must be supported by the host VM which isn\'t the case for most cloud-based CI providers due to infrastructural limits.  If you want to learn more about Emulators on CI, here\'s an article [Yang](https://github.com/ychescale9) wrote: [Running Android Instrumented Tests on CI](https://dev.to/ychescale9/running-android-emulators-on-ci-from-bitrise-io-to-github-actions-3j76).

## A note on VM Acceleration and why we don\'t need HAXM anymore

According to [this documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#vm-mac), ""on Mac OS X v10.10 Yosemite and higher, the Android Emulator uses the built-in [Hypervisor.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) by default, and falls back to using Intel HAXM if Hypervisor.Framework fails to initialize."" This means that **HAXM is only needed to achieve VM Acceleration if this default Hypervisor is not available on macOS machines.**

**Note**: Manually enabling and downloading HAXM is not recommended because it is redundant and not needed (see above), and for users of macOS 10.13 High Sierra and higher: macOS 10.13 [disables installation of kernel extensions by default](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017658). Because Intel HAXM is a kernel extension, we would need to manually enable its installation on the base runner VM. Furthermore, manually trying to install HAXM on a Github Runner [brings up a popup](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/discussions/286#discussioncomment-4026120) which further hinders tests from running.

## Purpose

This action helps automate and configure the process of setting up an emulator and running your tests by doing the following:

- Install / update the required **Android SDK** components including `build-tools`, `platform-tools`, `platform` (for the required API level), `emulator` and `system-images` (for the required API level).
- Create a new instance of **AVD** with the provided [configurations](#configurations).
- Launch a new Emulator with the provided [configurations](#configurations).
- Wait until the Emulator is booted and ready for use.
- Run a custom script provided by user once the Emulator is up and running - e.g. `./gradlew connectedCheck`.
- Kill the Emulator and finish the action.

## Usage & Examples

A workflow that uses **android-emulator-runner** to run your instrumented tests on **API 29**:

```yml
```

We can also leverage GitHub Actions\'s build matrix to test across multiple configurations:

```yml
```

If you need specific versions of **NDK** and **CMake** installed:

```yml
```

We can significantly reduce emulator startup time by setting up AVD snapshot caching:

1. add a `gradle/gradle-build-action@v2` step for caching Gradle, more details see [#229](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/229)
2. add an `actions/cache@v3` step for caching the `avd`
3. add a `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to generate a clean snapshot - specify `emulator-options` without `no-snapshot`
4. add another `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to run your tests using existing AVD / snapshot - specify `emulator-options` with `no-snapshot-save`

| `sdcard-path-or-size` | Optional | N/A | Path to the SD card image for this AVD or the size of a new SD card image to create for this AVD, in KB or MB, denoted with K or M. - e.g. `path/to/sdcard`, or `1000M`. |
| `disk-size` | Optional | N/A | Disk size, or partition size to use for this AVD. Either in bytes or KB, MB or GB, when denoted with K, M or G. - e.g. `2048M` |
| `avd-name` | Optional | `test` | Custom AVD name used for creating the Android Virtual Device. |
| `force-avd-creation` | Optional | `true` | Whether to force create the AVD by overwriting an existing AVD with the same name as `avd-name` - `true` or `false`. |
| `emulator-boot-timeout` | Optional | `600` | Emulator boot timeout in seconds. If it takes longer to boot, the action would fail - e.g. `300` for 5 minutes. |
| `emulator-options` | Optional | See below | Command-line options used when launching the emulator (replacing all default options) - e.g. `-no-window -no-snapshot -camera-back emulated`. |
| `disable-animations` | Optional | `true` | Whether to disable animations - `true` or `false`. |
| `disable-spellchecker` | Optional | `false` | Whether to disable spellchecker - `true` or `false`. |
| `disable-linux-hw-accel` | Optional | `auto` | Whether to disable hardware acceleration on Linux machines - `true`, `false` or `auto`.|

| `working-directory` | Optional | `./` | A custom working directory - e.g. `./android` if your root Gradle project is under the `./android` sub-directory within your repository. Will be used for `script` & `pre-emulator-launch-script`. |
| `ndk` | Optional | N/A | Version of NDK to install - e.g. `21.0.6113669` |
| `cmake` | Optional | N/A | Version of CMake to install - e.g. `3.10.2.4988404` |
| `channel` | Optional | stable | Channel to download the SDK components from - `stable`, `beta`, `dev`, `canary` |
| `script` | Required | N/A | Custom script to run - e.g. to run Android instrumented tests on the emulator: `./gradlew connectedCheck` |
| `pre-emulator-launch-script` | Optional | N/A | Custom script to run after creating the AVD and before launching the emulator - e.g. `./adjust-emulator-configs.sh` |

Default `emulator-options`: `-no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -no-snapshot -noaudio -no-boot-anim`.

## Can I use this action on Github Hosted Linux VMs?

The short answer is yes but on Github-hosted Linux runners it\'s expected to be a much worse experience (on some newer API levels it might not work at all) than running it on macOS, because of the current lack of hardware acceleration support. You can get it running much faster on self-hosted Linux runners but only if the underlying instances support KVM (which most don\'t). Things might be better on the newer Larger runners but they are still in Beta. It is possible to use this Action with hardware accelerated Linux VMs hosted by a third-party runner provider.

For a longer answer please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/46).

## Usage

### Example workflow

This example replaces `hello` with `world` in all of your project files.

```yaml
```

### Inputs

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find`                 | A string to find and replace in your project files. _(Defaults to a [regular expression](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).)_ |
| `replace`              | The string to replace it with.                                                                                                         |
| `include` _(optional)_ | A glob of files to include. _Defaults to `**`._                                                                                        |
| `exclude` _(optional)_ | A glob of files to exclude. _Defaults to `.git/**` ._                                                                                  |
| `regex` _(optional)_   | Whether to match with.find as a regular expression instead of a fixed string. _Defaults to `true`._                                    |

### Outputs

| Output          | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `modifiedFiles` | The number of files that have been modified |

## Examples

### Including a subdirectory

You can limit your find and replace to a directory.

```yaml
```

### Filter by file name

You can limit your find and replace to just files with a specific name.

```yaml
```

### Exclude by file type

You can set your find and replace to ignore certain file types.

```yaml
```

### Pushing changes back

Any modifications during a GitHub Actions workflow are only made to the working copy checked out by the `actions/checkout` step. If you want those changes to be pushed back to the repository you\'ll need to add a final step that does this.

```yaml
      - name: Push changes
        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@v0.6.0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          branch: ${{ github.ref }}
```

_If you need the push event to trigger other workflows, use a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)._

```yaml
```

## Publishing

To publish a new version of this Action we need to update the Docker image tag in `action.yml` and also create a new release on GitHub.

- Work out the next tag version number.
- Update the Docker image in `action.yml`.
- Create a new release on GitHub with the same tag.

342,"# install-jdk

An action to download and install JDKs for use in workflows.

This action is based on the [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
action by GitHub which works perfectly fine for simple workflows but does not
scale and lacks configurability.

JDKs are downloaded from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).


## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

#### Basic

```
```

#### Multiple JDKs

Some projects may require multiple JDK versions to build. `install-jdk` supports
installing JDKs to one (or more) given `target` environment variables.

```
```


### Configuration:

| Parameter            | Default                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `version`            |                                |
| `architecture`       | `x64`                          |
| `source`             | `releases`                     |
| `sourceType`         |                                |
| `archiveBasePath`    | `/Contents/Home/` (macOS only) |
| `useArchiveBasePath` | `true`                         |
| `archiveExtension`   |                                |
| `targets`            | `JAVA_HOME`                    |
| `impl   `            | `hotspot`                      |

#### `version`

The Java version to install a JDK for. (Supported values are: `1.8`, `8`, `9`,
`10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, ...)

By default, this action will try to install the latest JDK release for the
specified version from AdoptOpenJDK. Alternatively, a `source` can be specified
explicitly.

The `version` key should be set accordingly for custom downloads since it is
used to cache JDKs which are used multiple times during the workflow.

#### `architecture`

The target architecture of the JDK to install.

Defaults to `x64`.

#### `source`

A custom source for a JDK. (See `sourceType` for supported values.)

#### `sourceType`

The type of the `source` parameter. Supported source types are:

- `url` - HTTP and HTTPS URL sources
- `file` - local directories, or compressed archives
- `buildType` - AdoptOpenJDK build types (""nightly"", or ""releases"".)

The parameter may be set to empty, to automatically infer the type. The inferred
type is:

1. `url`, if `source` starts with ""http://"" or ""https://"",
2. `file`, if `source` resembles a valid local file path and the file exists, 
3. or `buildType` otherwise.

#### `archiveBasePath`

install-jdk expects a single top-level folder in archive packages. This
parameter may be used to specify the subdirectory of said folder in which the
JDK resides. This must be empty, or a `/`-separated path.

By default, this parameter is set to `/Contents/Home/` on macOS only to support
OpenJDK builds from Oracle, and OpenJDK and OpenJ9 builds from AdoptOpenJDK
out of the box.

When using builds from other sources, it may be necessary to disable use of this
parameter since the action cannot differentiate between empty and unspecified
parameters. (See `useArchiveBasePath`.)

#### `useArchiveBasePath`

Disables use of the `archiveBasePath` parameter. This must be a boolean value.

Build archives from custom other may have different directory structures for
which the default configuration would fail.
E.g.: For Azul\'s Zulu builds it should be set to false (`useArchiveBasePath : \'false\'`).

#### `archiveExtension`

The extension of the JDK archive. (Supported values are: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.7z`)

Specifying this parameter is required when a custom `source` is set.

#### `targets`

A semicolon-separated list of environment variables which will be set up to
point to the installation directory of the JDK.

By default, this is set to `JAVA_HOME`. Keep in mind that this is overwritten
when specifying targets explicitly. Thus, if you want to make a JDK available
from - say - `JDK_X` and `JAVA_HOME`, you would need to specify:

    targets: \'JDK_X;JAVA_HOME\'

#### `impl`

JVM implementation. (Supported values are: `hotspot`, `openj9`)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Run PHPUnit tests in Github Actions.
====================================

PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP.

It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

Usage
-----

Create your Github Workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or similar.

```yaml
```

### Version numbers

This action is released with semantic version numbers, but also tagged so the latest major release\'s tag always points to the latest release within the matching major version.

Please feel free to use `uses: php-actions/phpunit@v3` to always run the latest version of v3, or `uses: php-actions/phpunit@v3.0.0` to specify the exact release.

Example
-------

We\'ve put together an extremely simple example application that uses `php-actions/phpunit`. Check it out here: https://github.com/php-actions/example-phpunit.

Inputs
------

The following configuration options are available:

+ `version` The version of PHPUnit to use e.g. `9` or `9.5.0` (default: latest)
+ `php_version` The version of PHP to use e.g. `7.4` (default: latest)
+ `php_extensions` Space-separated list of extensions using [php-build][php-build] e.g. `xdebug mbstring` (default: N/A)
+ `vendored_phpunit_path` The path to a phar file already present on the runner (default: N/A)
+ `configuration` Path to the `phpunit.xml` file (default: `test/phpunit/phpunit.xml`)
+ `log_junit` Log test execution in JUnit XML format to file
+ `log_teamcity` Log test execution in TeamCity format to file 
+ `testdox_html` Write documentation in HTML format to file
+ `testdox_text` Write documentation in Text format to file
+ `memory_limit` The memory limit to run your tests with (default: `128M`)
+ `bootstrap` The path to the bootstrap file
+ `filter` Filter which tests to run
+ `testsuite` Specify a testsuite to run
+ `group` Only runs tests from the specified group(s)
+ `exclude_group` Exclude tests from the specified group(s)
+ `test_suffix` Only search for test in files with specified suffix(es)
+ `whitelist` Path to directory to whitelist for code coverage analysis
+ `coverage_clover` Generate code coverage report in Clover XML format
+ `coverage_cobertura` Generate code coverage report in Cobertura XML format
  required
+ `coverage_crap4j` Generate code coverage report in Crap4J XML format
+ `coverage_html` Generate code coverage report in HTML format
+ `coverage_php` Export PHP_CodeCoverage object to file
+ `coverage_text` Generate code coverage report in text format (true to output to console, path to output to file)
+ `coverage_xml` Generate code coverage report in PHPUnit XML format
+ `args` Extra arguments to pass to the phpunit binary

The syntax for passing in a custom input is the following:

```yaml
```

If you require other configurations of phpunit, please request them in the [Github issue tracker][issues]

PHP and PHPUnit versions
------------------------

It\'s possible to run any version of PHPUnit under any version of PHP, with any PHP extensions you require. This is configured with the following inputs:

+ `version` - the version number of PHPUnit to run e.g. `9` or `9.5.0` (default: latest)
+ `php_version` - the version number of PHP to use e.g. `7.4` (default: latest)
+ `php_extensions` - a space-separated list of extensions to install using [php-build][php-build] e.g. `xdebug mbstring` (default: N/A)

Please note the version number specified within your Action configuration must match your `composer.json` major version number. For example, if your composer.json requires `phpunit/phpunit 8.5.8`, you must use the `version: 8.5.8` input, as major versions of PHPUnit are incompatible with each other.

If you require a specific version that is not compatible with Github Actions for some reason, please make a request in the [Github issue tracker][issues].

Coverage
--------

To store the code coverage, use the `coverage_*` input that is appropriate for your needs. Coverage information is made possible by using the xdebug extension, which will be required to be added to the `php_extensions` input to work.

Example:

```yaml
```

The above example will output coverage information to the terminal. Pass a file path to output to a file.

If you want to report coverage information somewhere, please see the [code-coverage] action.

Github Actions releases
-----------------------

Previously, the Github Actions release version numbers were in sync with the PHPUnit version, but this imposed too many limitations. For the next 12 months (until 30th November 2021), v7, v8 and v9 branches will still point to their existing commits, but we have reverted to v1-based Actions releases, allowing PHPUnit version number to be specified from your configuration, using the `version` input variable.

344,"# Warning

Scan is now in maintenance mode. If you\'ve just come across this project, then probably best to look at any alternatives. Read more [here](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/issues/352).

# Overview

```bash
```

[Security Scan](https://slscan.io) is a free and open-source security tool for modern DevOps teams. With an integrated multi-scanner based design, Scan can detect various kinds of security flaws in your application and infrastructure code in a single fast scan without the need for any _remote server_! The product supports a range of integration options: from scanning every push via a git hook to scanning every build and pull-request in the CI/CD pipelines.

## Highlighted Features

### Supported scans

- Credentials Scanning to detect accidental secret leaks
- Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) for a range of languages and frameworks
- Open-source dependencies and License audit
- Pull Request status checks and Scan summary as comments

### Languages supported

- Salesforce Apex
- bash
- Go
- Java
- JSP
- Node.js
- Oracle PL/SQL
- Python
- Rust (Dependency and Licence scan alone)
- Terraform
- Salesforce Visual Force
- Apache Velocity

## Getting Started

Simply add the following snippet to your GitHub actions workflow.

```yaml
```

To override the built-in language detection, use the `type` parameter.

```yaml
  with:
    type: ""credscan,java,depscan""
```

For a full example, refer to the [workflow](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/blob/master/.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml) file used by Scan to scan itself.

### Viewing Reports

Scan summary would get printed directly on the action build log as shown.

![Scan Invocation](docs/scan-invocation.png)

![Scan Summary](docs/scan-summary.png)

The action also produces HTML reports for the various scans. To upload the reports as build artifacts to your pipeline use the `upload-artifact` step as shown:

```yaml
  with:
    type: ""credscan,python""
  env:
    WORKSPACE: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/${{ github.sha }}
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
  with:
    name: reports
    path: reports
```

In the above configuration, two environment variables are used to customise the behaviour:

- WORKSPACE: Specifying the URL to your repository would transform the filenames in the reports to hyperlinks. Specify empty string `""""` when using the `Code Scanning` feature on GitHub
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Passing the GitHub token would improve the scan results by increasing the allowance for package names lookup during dependency scanning

## Tips & Tricks

### Automatic build

Scan can attempt to build certain project types automatically. Java, node.js, rust, go and csharp are currently supported. To enable auto-build, set the environment variable `SCAN_AUTO_BUILD` as shown:

```yaml
  with:
    type: ""credscan,python""
  env:
    WORKSPACE: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/${{ github.sha }}
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SCAN_AUTO_BUILD: true
```

## Documentation

Please refer to the [documentation](https://slscan.io) on using ShiftLeft Scan in your pipelines.

## Support

Developers behind scan are available on a dedicated [discord channel](https://discord.gg/7WvSxdK) for questions and support. For defects, raising an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/issues) is best.

You can also install the [Release Drafter GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter), choosing the repositories for which you want releases automatically created.

## Configuration

Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository.

### Example

For example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:

```yml
```

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:

<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />

The following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:

```yml
```

## Configuration Options

You can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

| Key                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `template`            | Required | The template for the body of the draft release. Use [template variables](#template-variables) to insert values.                                                                                                   |
| `name-template`       | Optional | The template for the name of the draft release. For example: `""v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION""`.                                                                                                                            |
| `tag-template`        | Optional | The template for the tag of the draft release. For example: `""v$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION""`.                                                                                                                             |
| `version-template`    | Optional | The template to use when calculating the next version number for the release. Useful for projects that don\'t use semantic versioning. Default: `""$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH""`                                           |
| `change-template`     | Optional | The template to use for each merged pull request. Use [change template variables](#change-template-variables) to insert values. Default: `""* $TITLE (#$NUMBER) @$AUTHOR""`.                                        |
| `no-changes-template` | Optional | The template to use for when there\xe2\x80\x99s no changes. Default: `""* No changes""`.                                                                                                                                       |
| `branches`            | Optional | The branches to listen for configuration updates to `.github/release-drafter.yml` and for merge commits. Useful if you want to test the app on a pull request branch. Default is the repository\xe2\x80\x99s default branch. |
| `categories`          | Optional | Categorize pull requests using labels. Refer to [Categorize Pull Requests](#categorize-pull-requests) to learn more about this option.                                                                            |
| `exclude-lables`      | Optional | Exclude pull requests using labels. Refer to [Exclude Pull Requests](#exclude-pull-requests) to learn more about this option.                                                                                     |
| `replacers`           | Optional | Search and replace content in the generated changelog body. Refer to [Replacers](#replacers) to learn more about this option.                                                                                     |
| `sort-direction`      | Optional | Sort changelog by merged date in ascending or descending order. Can be one of: `ascending`, `descending`. Default: `descending`.                                                                                  |

Release Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.

## Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`:

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |
| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |
| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases\xe2\x80\x99s tag.                                                                                          |

## Next Version Variables

You can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |
| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |
| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |

## Version Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:

| Variable | Description               |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `$PATCH` | The patch version number. |
| `$MINOR` | The minor version number. |
| `$MAJOR` | The major version number. |

## Change Template Variables

You can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:

| Variable  | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$NUMBER` | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                  |
| `$TITLE`  | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. |
| `$AUTHOR` | The pull request author\xe2\x80\x99s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.     |

## Categorize Pull Requests

With the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:

<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />

Adding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).

## Exclude Pull Requests

With the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:

```yml
```

Pull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.

## Replacers

You can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.

```yml
```

## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning

If your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.

For example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.

## GitHub Installation Permissions

Release Drafter requires full write, because GitHub does not offer a limited scope for only writing releases. **Don\'t install Release Drafter to your entire GitHub account \xe2\x80\x94 only add the repositories you want to draft releases on.**

## Developing

If you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:

```sh
```

Once you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.

If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```sh
```

## Contributing

Third-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.

If you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

## Releasing

Run the following command:

```bash
```

The command does the following:

- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes
- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch
- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:
  - Pushes the tag to GitHub
  - Publishes the npm release
  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)
  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes

346,"# global-json-dotnet-install

Github action that installs .NET SDKs.

Allows optional additional SDKs to be installed (for example, if you install the .NET 3.1 SDK, you can\'t run .NET Core 2 apps unless you have the .NET Core 2 runtime installed too)

For example, given this global.json, the .NET 5 preview 7 SDK will be installed if it isn\'t present on the system, along with .NET Core 3.1 and 2.1 SDKs.

(The ""others"" property is not part of the global.json spec, it\'s just used by this task)

```json
```

In your Github Actions yaml file you can then specify the following to extract these version numbers and then install the relevant SDKS.

```yaml
```

The SDKs are installed into the `.dotnetsdk` directory and this is added to the PATH.

This task is a temporary workaround until `setup-dotnet` supports side-by-side SDK installation (see https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/25)

 > [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for running [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) end-to-end and component tests. Includes npm, pnpm and Yarn installation, custom caching and lots of configuration options.

 Placing `use: cypress-io/github-action@v5` into a GitHub Action workflow gives you a simple way to run Cypress. The action takes the project\'s npm, pnpm or Yarn package manager lock file, installs dependencies and caches these dependencies for future use. It then proceeds to run Cypress end-to-end tests with the built-in Electron browser and provides a test summary after completion.

 If you are testing against a running server like the [Cypress Kitchen Sink showcase example](https://example.cypress.io/) on https://example.cypress.io/ no other parameters are necessary. In other cases where you need to fire up a development server, you can add the [start](#start-server) parameter to the workflow. Browse through the examples to find other useful parameters.

Current examples contained in this repository are based on Cypress 12.x and can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory. Examples for [Legacy Configuration](https://on.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration) use Cypress `9.7.0` and are kept in the [examples/v9](./examples/v9) directory.

Live examples, such as [example-basic.yml](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml) are shown together with a status badge. Click on the status badge to read the source code of the workflow, for example

[![End-to-End example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-basic/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml)

Some older **external** examples, linked to by this document, are based solely on Cypress 9 and below and therefore use a [Legacy Configuration](https://on.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration). These may need modification to be applied to Cypress 10 and later. Each of these external links is listed with a `(legacy)` notation.

**Note:** this package assumes that [cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) is declared as a development dependency in the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file) file. The [cypress npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) is required to run Cypress via its [Module API](https://on.cypress.io/module-api).

### End-to-End Testing

```yml
```

[![End-to-End example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-basic/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml)

The workflow file [example-basic.yml](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml) shows how Cypress runs on GH Actions using Ubuntu (20 and 22), Windows, and macOS without additional OS dependencies necessary.

This workflow uses the default [test type](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Test-types) of [End-to-End (E2E) Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end). Alternatively, [Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Component) can be utilized by referencing the [Component Testing](#component-testing) section below.

### Component Testing

To use [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component-testing) add `component: true`

```yml
```

[![Component Testing example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-component-test/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml)

See the example project [component-tests](examples/component-tests/) and the [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) workflow for more details.

### Action version

**Best practice:**

Our examples specify using branch [v5](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tree/v5) which is the action\'s latest major version:

```yml
```

When using `cypress-io/github-action@v5` from your workflow file, you will automatically use the latest [tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tags) from branch [v5](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tree/v5).

Alternatively, to mitigate unforeseen breaks, bind to a specific [tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tags), for example:

```yml
```

The changes associated with each tag are shown under GitHub\'s [releases](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/releases) list. Refer also to the [Changelog](#changelog) for an overview of major changes.

### Browser

Specify the browser name or path with the `browser` parameter. The default browser, if none is specified, is the built-in [Electron browser](https://on.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser).

### Chrome

```yml
```

[![Chrome example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-chrome/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-chrome.yml)

### Firefox

```yml
```

[![Firefox example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-firefox/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-firefox.yml)

### Edge

```yml
```

[![Edge example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-edge/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-edge.yml)

### Headed

Run the browser in headed mode - as of Cypress v8.0 the `cypress run` command executes tests in `headless` mode by default

```yml
```

### Docker image

You can run tests in a GH Action in your Docker container.

```yml
```

### Env

Specify the env argument with `env` parameter

```yml
```

When passing the environment variables this way, unfortunately due to GitHub Actions syntax, the variables should be listed in a single line, which can be hard to read. As an alternative, you can use the step\'s `env` block where every variable can be set on its own line. In this case, you should prefix every variable with `CYPRESS_` because such variables [are loaded by Cypress automatically](https://on.cypress.io/environment-variables). The above code example is equivalent to:

```yml
```

For more examples, see the workflows below, using environment variables for [recording](#record-test-results-on-cypress-cloud).

[![Env example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-env/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-env.yml)

### Specs

Specify the [spec files to run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt) with `spec` parameter

```yml
```

You can pass multiple specs and wild card patterns using multi-line parameter, see [example-config.yml](.github/workflows/example-config.yml):

```yml
```

For more information, visit [the Cypress command-line docs](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt).

### Project

Specify the [project to run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt) with `project` parameter

```yml
```

For more information, visit [the Cypress command-line docs](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt).

### Record test results on Cypress Cloud

By setting the parameter `record` to `true`, you can record your test results into the [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). Read the [Cypress Cloud documentation](https://on.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) to learn how to sign up and create a Cypress Cloud project.

```yml
```

**Tip 1:** We recommend using the action with `on: push` instead of `on: pull_request` to get the most accurate information related to the commit on Cypress Cloud. With pull requests, the merge commit is created automatically and might not correspond to a meaningful commit in the repository.

**Tip 2:** we recommend passing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret (created by the GH Action automatically) as an environment variable. This will allow correctly identifying every build and avoid confusion when re-running a build.

**Tip 3:** if running on `pull_request` event, the commit message is ""merge SHA into SHA"", which is not what you want probably. You can overwrite the commit message sent to Cypress Cloud by setting an environment variable. See [issue 124](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124#issuecomment-653180260) for details.

**Tip 4:** to record the project needs `projectId`. Typically this value is saved in the [Cypress Configuration File](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Configuration-File). If you want to avoid this, pass the `projectId` using an environment variable:

```yml
          # pass the project ID from the secrets through environment variable
          CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Tag recordings

You can pass a single or multiple tags when recording a run. For example

```yml
```

The recording will have tags as labels on the run.

![Tags](images/tags.png)

You can pass multiple tags using commas like `tag: node-18,nightly,staging`.

### Specify auto cancel after failures

Specify the number of failed tests that will cancel a run when using the [Cypress Cloud Auto Cancellation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) feature.

This feature requires Cypress 12.6.0 or later and a [Cypress Cloud Business or Enterprise](https://www.cypress.io/cloud/) account.

```yml
```

See [Auto Cancellation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) for more information.

### Artifacts

If you don\'t record the test run on Cypress Cloud, you can still store generated videos and screenshots as CI artifacts. See the workflow example below.

```yml
```

### Quiet flag

You can provide `quiet` flag for cypress run to silence any Cypress specific output from stdout

```yml
```

[![example-quiet](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-quiet/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-quiet.yml)

### Config

Specify [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html) values with `config` parameter

```yml
```

[![example-config](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-config/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-config.yml)

### Config File

Specify the path to your config file with `config-file` parameter

```yml
```

### Parallel

**Note:** Cypress parallelization requires a [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction) account.

You can spin multiple containers running in parallel using `strategy: matrix` argument. Just add more dummy items to the `containers: [1, 2, ...]` array to spin more free or paid containers. Then use `record` and `parallel` parameters to [load balance tests](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization).

```yml
```

![Parallel run](images/parallel.png)

**Warning \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f:** Cypress actions use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to get the correct branch and the number of jobs run, making it possible to re-run without the need of pushing an empty commit. If you don\'t want to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` you can still run your tests without problem with the only note that Cypress Cloud\'s API connects parallel jobs into a single logical run using GitHub commit SHA plus workflow name. If you attempt to re-run GitHub checks, Cypress Cloud thinks the run has already ended. In order to truly rerun parallel jobs, push an empty commit with `git commit --allow-empty -m ""re-run checks"" && git push`. As another work around you can generate and cache a custom build id, read [Adding a unique build number to GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/attest-engineering/adding-a-unique-github-build-identifier-7aa2e83cadca).

The Cypress GH Action does not spawn or create any additional containers - it only links the multiple containers spawned using the matrix strategy into a single logical Cypress Cloud run where it splits the specs amongst the machines. See the [Cypress parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) guide for the explanation.

During staged rollout of a new GitHub-hosted runner version, GitHub may provide a mixture of current and new image versions used by the container matrix. It is recommended to use a [Docker image](#docker-image) in the parallel job run which avoids any Cypress Cloud errors due to browser major version mismatch from the two different image versions. A [Docker image](#docker-image) is not necessary if testing against the default built-in Electron browser because this browser version is fixed by the Cypress version in use and it is unaffected by any GitHub runner image rollout.

### Component and E2E Testing

[Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Component) and [End-to-End (E2E) Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end) types can be combined in the same job using separate steps

```yml
```

See the example project [component-test](examples/component-tests/) and the [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) workflow for more details.

### Build app

You can run a build step before starting tests

```yml
```

### Start server

If your tests run against a local server, use the `start` parameter to start your server. The server will run in the background.

```yml
```
**Caution:** use the `start` parameter only to start a server, not to run Cypress, otherwise tests may be run twice. The action runs Cypress tests by default, unless the parameter `runTests` is set to `false`.

**Note:** sometimes on Windows you need to run a different start command. You can use the `start-windows` parameter for this.

```yml
```

[![start example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start.yml)

**Note:** A server continues to run until the end of the GitHub workflow job that started it. At the end of the job the GitHub workflow runner executes a ""Complete job"" phase automatically where it terminates any server processes which are still running.

### Start multiple servers

You can start multiple server processes. For example, if you have an API to start using `npm run api` and the web server to start using `npm run web` you can put those commands in `start` using comma separation.

```yml
```

You can place the start commands in separate lines

```yml
```

[![start example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start.yml)

### Wait-on

If you are starting a local server and it takes a while to start, you can add a parameter `wait-on` and pass url to wait for the server to respond.

```yml
```

[![wait-on example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-wait-on/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-wait-on.yml)

[![Webpack Dev Server example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-webpack/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-webpack.yml) (also uses `wait-on`)

By default, `wait-on` will retry for 60 seconds. You can pass a custom timeout in seconds using `wait-on-timeout`.

```yml
```



You can wait for multiple URLs to respond by separating urls with a comma

```yml
```

The action will wait for the first url to respond, then will check the second url, and so on.

You can even use your own command (usually by using `npm`, `yarn`, `npx`) to wait for the server to respond. For example, if you want to use the [wait-on](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on) utility to ping the server and run the Cypress tests after the server responds:

```yml
```

See [example-wait-on.yml](.github/workflows/example-wait-on.yml) workflow file.

If this action times out waiting for the server to respond, please see [Debugging](#debugging) section in this README file.

#### `wait-on` with Node.js 18+

Under Node.js version 18 and later, `wait-on` may fail to recognize that a `localhost` server is running. This affects development web servers which do not listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks.

- Check your server documentation to see if it can be started using `0.0.0.0` (all addresses) and use this if available. If this option is not available or does not resolve the issue then carry on to the next steps:
- If the action log shows that `wait-on` is failing to connect to `127.0.0.1`, replace `localhost` by `[::1]` (the IPv6 loopback address)
- If the action log shows that `wait-on` is failing to connect to `::1`, replace `localhost` by `127.0.0.1` (the IPv4 loopback address)

### Custom install command

If you want to overwrite the install command

```yml
```

See [example-install-command.yml](.github/workflows/example-install-command.yml) workflow file.

### Command prefix

You can prefix the default test command using the `command-prefix` option. This is useful for example when running [Percy](https://docs.percy.io/docs/cypress), which requires the test command to be wrapped with `percy exec --`.

```yml
```

### Custom test command

You can overwrite the Cypress run command with your own command.

```yml
```

**Caution**: using the action parameter `command` causes multiple other parameters to be ignored including: `auto-cancel-after-failures`, `browser`, `ci-build-id`, `command-prefix`, `component`, `config`, `config-file`, `env`, `group`, `headed`, `parallel`, `project`, `publish-summary`, `quiet`, `record`, `spec` and `tag`.

See [example-custom-command.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-command.yml) file.

### Custom build id

You can overwrite [`ci-build-id`](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization#Linking-CI-machines-for-parallelization-or-grouping) used to link separate machines running tests into a single parallel run.

```yml
```

**Tip:** see [Learn GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions), with sections on Expressions, Contexts and Environment variables.

### Robust custom build id

If you re-run the GitHub workflow, if you use the same custom build id during recording, Cypress Cloud will cancel the run with ""Build already finished"" error. To avoid this, you need to generate a _new_ custom build id on every workflow re-run. A good solution showing in the [example-custom-ci-build-id.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-ci-build-id.yml) file is to run a common job first that just generates a new random ID. This ID can be used by the testing jobs to tie the build together. If the user re-runs the workflow a new unique build id is generated, allowing recording the new Cypress Cloud run.

```yml
```

See the [example-custom-ci-build-id.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-ci-build-id.yml) for the full workflow.

### Working directory

In a monorepo, the end-to-end or component test might be placed in a different sub-folder from the application itself.

Using a [Cypress legacy configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration) (Version 9 or earlier) the structure could look like this:

```text
```

For End-to-End testing using a [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for Version 10 and later, the structure could look like this :

```text
```

Similarly for Component Testing with a [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for Version 10 and later, the structure could look like this:

```text
```

You can specify the `app-test` working directory when running Cypress tests using the `working-directory` parameter

```yml
```

See [example-basic.yml](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml) for an End-to-End test example and [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) for a Component test example, using the parameter `working-directory`.

### Subfolders

Sometimes Cypress and end-to-end tests have their own `package.json` file in a subfolder, like

```text
```

In that case you can combine this action with [bahmutov/npm-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install) action to install dependencies separately.

```yml
```

See [cypress-gh-action-subfolders](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-subfolders) (legacy) for example.

### pnpm

The package manager `pnpm` is not pre-installed in [GitHub Actions runner images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) (unlike `npm` and `yarn`): to install `pnpm` include [pnpm/action-setup](https://github.com/pnpm/action-setup) in your workflow. If the action finds a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, it uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/install) command `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` by default to install dependencies.

```yaml
```

[![pnpm example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-basic-pnpm/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-basic-pnpm.yml)

### Yarn Classic

If a `yarn.lock` file is found, the action uses the [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) command `yarn --frozen-lockfile` by default to install dependencies.

```yaml
```

[![Yarn classic example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-yarn-classic/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-yarn-classic.yml)

### Yarn Modern

To install dependencies using a `yarn.lock` file from [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn 2 and later) you need to override the default [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) installation command `yarn --frozen-lockfile`. You can do this by using the `install-command` parameter and specifying `yarn install` for example:

```yaml
```

This example covers the [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) configuration `nodeLinker: node-modules` which Yarn uses by default for projects updated from Yarn Classic. For `nodeLinker: pnp` see [Yarn Plug\'n\'Play](#yarn-plugnplay) below.
(Note that `github-action` is not compatible with the `nodeLinker: pnpm` setting.)

[![Yarn Modern example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-yarn-modern/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-yarn-modern.yml)

### Yarn Plug\'n\'Play

When using [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn 2 and later) with [Plug\'n\'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) enabled, you will need to use the `command` parameter to run [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/run) instead of [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npx).

```yaml
```

This example covers the [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) configuration when `nodeLinker` is undefined or set to `nodeLinker: pnp` corresponding to Yarn Plug\'n\'Play. Yarn uses this by default for projects newly created with Yarn Modern.

[![Yarn Plug\'n\'Play example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions/workflows/example-yarn-modern-pnp.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions/workflows/example-yarn-modern-pnp.yml)

**Caution**: using the action parameter `command` causes multiple other parameters to be ignored. [See `command` section for more information.](#custom-test-command)

### Yarn workspaces

This action should discover the Yarn workspaces correctly. For example, see folder [examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces](examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces) and workflow file [example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml](.github/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml)

```yaml
```

[![Yarn workspaces example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml)

### Custom cache key

Sometimes the default cache key does not work. For example, if you cannot share the Node modules across Node versions due to native extensions. In that case pass your own `cache-key` parameter.

```yml
```

### Node versions

You can run your tests across multiple Node versions.

```yml
```

See the [Node.js](#nodejs) section for information about supported versions and usage of Node.js.

[![Node versions example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-node-versions/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-node-versions.yml)

### Split install and tests

Sometimes you may want to run additional commands between installation and tests. To enable this use the `install` and `runTests` parameters.

```yml
```

See [cypress-gh-action-monorepo](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-monorepo) for a working example.

### Custom install

Finally, you might not need this GH Action at all. For example, if you want to split the npm dependencies installation from the Cypress binary installation, then it makes no sense to use this action. Instead you can install and cache Cypress yourself. See [cypress-gh-action-split-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-split-install) (legacy) for a working example.

### Install Cypress only

If the project has many dependencies, but you want to install just Cypress you can combine this action with `actions/cache` and `npm i cypress` commands yourself.

```yml
```

[![Install only Cypress example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-install-only/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-install-only.yml)

### Timeouts

You can tell the CI to stop the job or the individual step if it runs for longer then a given time limit. This is a good practice to ensure the hanging process does not accidentally use up all your CI minutes.

```yml
```

See [cypress-gh-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-example) (legacy).

## Notes

### Installation

This action installs local dependencies using lock files. Ensure that exactly one type of lock file is used for each project or working-directory from the following supported package managers:

 | Lock file           | Package Manager                                                                                  | Installation command             |
 | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
 | `package-lock.json` | [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-ci)                                             | `npm ci`                         |
 | `pnpm-lock.yaml`    | [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/install#--frozen-lockfile)                                            | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |

See section [Yarn Modern](#yarn-modern) for information about using Yarn version 2 and later.

## Debugging

This action uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module to output additional verbose logs. You can see these debug messages by setting the following environment variable:

```
```

You can set the environment variable using GitHub UI interface, or in the workflow file:

```yml
```

See the [example-debug.yml](.github/workflows/example-debug.yml) workflow file.

### Logs from the test runner

The above `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` setting enables the debug logs from the action itself. To see the [Cypress debug logs](http://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting#Print-DEBUG-logs) add an environment variable to the action:

```yml
```

### Debugging waiting for URL to respond

If you have a problem with `wait-on` not working, you can check the [src/ping.js](src/ping.js) logic from the local machine.

- clone this repository to the local machine
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- start your server
- from another terminal call the `ping` yourself to validate the server is responding:

```
```

For example

```
```

## Extras

### Manual trigger

If you add `workflow_dispatch` event to your workflow, you will be able to start the workflow by clicking a button on the GitHub page, see the [Test External Site Using GitHub Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TeSOj2Iy_Q) video.

### Outputs

This action sets a GitHub step output `resultsUrl` if the run was recorded on [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction) using the action parameter setting `record: true` (see [Record test results on Cypress Cloud](#record-test-results-on-cypress-cloud)). Note that using a [Custom test command](#custom-test-command) with the `command` parameter overrides the `record` parameter and in this case no `resultsUrl` step output is saved.

This is an example of using the step output `resultsUrl`:

```yml
```

The GitHub step output `dashboardUrl` is deprecated. Cypress Dashboard is now [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction).

[![recording example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-recording/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-recording.yml)

**Note:** every GitHub workflow step can have `outcome` and `conclusion` properties. See the GitHub [Contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts) documentation section [steps context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#steps-context). In particular, the `outcome` or `conclusion` value can be `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, or `skipped` which you can use in any following steps.

### Print Cypress info

Sometimes you might want to print Cypress and OS information, like the list of detected browsers. You can use the [`cypress info`](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-info) command for this.

If you are NOT using the `build` command in your project, you can run the `cypress info` command:

```yml
```

If you are already using the `build` parameter, you can split the [installation and the test steps](#split-install-and-tests) and insert the `cypress info` command in between:

```yml
```

### Nightly tests

Sometimes you want to execute the workflow on a schedule. For example, to run Cypress tests nightly, you can schedule the workflow using `cron` syntax:

```yml
```

### Suppress test summary

The default test summary can be suppressed by using the parameter `publish-summary` and setting its value to `false`.
Sometimes users want to publish test summary using a specific action.
For example, a user running Cypress tests using a matrix and wants to retrieve the test summary for each matrix job and use a specific action that merges reports.

```yml
```

## Node.js

### Support

Node.js is required to run this action. The current version `v5` supports:

- **Node.js** 16.x
- **Node.js** 18.x
- **Node.js** 20.x and above

and is generally aligned with [Node.js\'s release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).

### Usage

`github-action` command-type options such as [`install-command`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#custom-install-command), [`build`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#build-app), [`start`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#start-server) and [`command`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#custom-test-command) are executed with the runner\'s version of Node.js. You can use GitHub\'s [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) to install an explicit Node.js version into the runner.

[![Node versions example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-node-versions/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-node-versions.yml)

Cypress itself runs with a fixed Node.js version specified by the [runs.using](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions) parameter of [action.yml](action.yml). For `github-action@v5` this is `node16`.

## Changelog

View the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) document for an overview of version changes.

## Compatibility

- `v5` is the recommended version of [cypress-io/github-action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action)
- `v4` is the minimum version required for Cypress `10.x` and later

Pay attention to any GitHub Actions deprecation warnings shown in logs which may recommend updating.

GitHub Actions workflow to sync GitHub labels in the declarative way.

By using this workflow, you can sync current labels with labels configured in a YAML manifest.

## Usage

### Create YAML manifest of GitHub labels

```yaml
```

![](docs/assets/screenshot.png)

The default file path is `.github/labels.yml`, but you can specify any file path with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.manifest`.

To create manifest of the current labels easily, using [label-exporter](https://github.com/micnncim/label-exporter) is recommended.

### Create Workflow

An example workflow is here.

```yaml
```

If a label color or description changes, the same label is updated with the new color or description. If a label name changes, the previous label is deleted by default.
Also all existing labels which not listed in `manifest` will be deleted by default.
All issues and PRs that were previously labeled with this label are now unlabeled.

You can add `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.prune: false` in order to preserver all existing labels which is not mentioned in `manifest`, in this case when a label will be renamed old label will be not deleted.

## Sync labels on another repository

It is also possible to specify a repository or repositories as an input to the action. This is useful if you want to store your labels somewhere centrally and modify multiple repository labels.

**Note: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not have permissions to operate on other repositories so you must specify a personal access token in your secrets.**

```yaml
```

352,"# Python for Actions
This repository contains the code and scripts that we use to build Python packages used in [runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) and accessible through the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) Action.
File [versions-manifest.json](./versions-manifest.json) contains the list of available and released versions.

> Caution: this is prepared for and only permitted for use by actions `runner-images` and `setup-python` action.

Some versions are pre-installed on [runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) images.
More versions are available to install on-the-fly through the [`setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.

## Building installation packages
**Ubuntu:** The official Python sources are downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/), built using the `make` tool, and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation. We build each Python version against all [versions of Ubuntu](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) that are available at the time the Python version is released.

**macOS:** 
- For **Python < 3.11**, the official Python sources are downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/), built using the `make` tool, and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.  For backward compatibility, we build each Python version against the oldest [version of macOS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) that is available at the time the Python version is released.
- For **Python >= 3.11**, the official macOS `universal2` Python binaries are simply downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.

**Windows:** The official Python executables are simply downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.

## Support policy
We aim to make new versions of Python available as soon as they are released. Both stable and prerelease versions are considered for building and releasing. Please open an issue in [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) if a version you're looking for isn't available.

When a new version of an operating system is released and made available for use with [GitHub hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources), we will provide the **latest existing patch versions of Python for all major versions that have not reached [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)**.  Any subsequent Python versions will be made available for the new OS as well.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
   - untracked (new) files
   - tracked (modified) files
   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.

## Usage

```yml
```

You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v3.x.x`

### Action inputs

All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: push` or `on: pull_request` workflow then you cannot use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` |
| `commit-message` | The message to use when committing changes. | `[create-pull-request] automated change` |
| `committer` | The committer name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. | `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` |
| `author` | The author name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. | `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>` |
| `signoff` | Add [`Signed-off-by`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. | `false` |
| `branch` | The pull request branch name. | `create-pull-request/patch` |
| `branch-suffix` | The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are `random`, `timestamp` and `short-commit-hash`. See [Alternative strategy](#alternative-strategy---always-create-a-new-pull-request-branch) for details. | |
| `base` | Sets the pull request base branch. | Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow. |
| `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork\'s branch into the parent\'s base. See [push pull request branches to a fork](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details. | |
| `title` | The title of the pull request. | `Changes by create-pull-request action` |

| `reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from. | |
| `team-reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) may be required. See [this issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/155). | |
| `milestone` | The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with. | |
| `draft` | Create a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). | `false` |

### Action outputs

The pull request number is output as a step output.
Note that in order to read the step output the action step must have an id.

```yml
```

### Checkout

This action expects repositories to be checked out with `actions/checkout@v2`.

If there is some reason you need to use `actions/checkout@v1` the following step can be added to checkout the branch.

```yml
```

### Action behaviour

The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.
Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.
Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.
- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
- If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the base and pull request branch), the pull request is automatically closed and the branch deleted.

For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).

#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch

For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.
This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.

- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`

- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`

- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`

### Controlling commits

As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.

```yml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name \'Peter Evans\'
          git config user.email \'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com\'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am ""Modify tracked file during workflow""
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m ""Add untracked file during workflow""
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
```

### Ignoring files

If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

### Create a project card

To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.

```yml
```

## Reference Example

The following workflow is a reference example that sets many of the main inputs.

See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.

```yml
```

An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:

357,"# Include Guards Check (GitHub Action)

This is a [GitHub Action](//help.github.com/en/actions) to check for
`#include` guards in C/C++ header files.

We consider files with extensions `.h`, `.H`, `.hh`, `.hpp`, and `.hxx`
as header files.
In these files we check for the existence of constructs like
```c
```
where `SOME_NAME` is based on the file name according to a pattern
that can be specified by the user.

Note that we do not really parse the preprocessor code, we just perform
simple shell scripting.
That means, you can easily trick the check script into false positives.
However, why should you do that?

## Inputs

### `path`

The base path to look for header files,
for example `src` or `include`.

Default is the root of the repository, i.e., `.`.

### `pattern`

The pattern to construct the macro name based on the file name.

The pattern is a simple string with some replacement fields, i.e.,
substrings in curly braces that will be replaced by (user-specified)
and *macrofied* parts of the file name.
*Macrofication* means that we transform all lower-case letters to
upper-case and replace all non-alphanumeric characters by underscores (`_`).

Here is a list of available replacement field specifiers with an example for
the file `dir1/dir2/dir3/file.fuzz.hpp`:

 * **{path}**: `DIR1_DIR2_DIR3_FILE_FUZZ_HPP`
 * **{file}**: `FILE_FUZZ_HPP`
 * **{file_ext}**: `HPP`
 * **{file_base}**: `FILE_FUZZ`
 * **{dirs}**: `DIR1_DIR2_DIR3`
 * **{first_dir}**: `DIR1`
 * **{last_dir}**: `DIR3`

Note that it is always useful to use your project name as a prefix
to avoid name clashes with header guards of other projects.

Default is `{path}`, which is useful if your path structure is
like `<project name>/<header file>` or
`<project name>/<some category>/<header file>`.

### `only`

The regular expression for paths to check.
Paths not matching this regular expression are ignored.

Three artificial examples:
 * `dir/\\(foo\\|bar\\)\\.h` checks `dir/foo.h` and `dir/bar.h` only,
 * `^v[0-9\\.]\\+/` checks paths beginning with a versional directory only,
 * `/.*/` checks paths with at least two directories only.

By default, all paths are checked.

### `ignore`

The regular expression for paths to ignore.
This is possibly a simpler way (than using `only`) to exclude
files from checking.

By default, no paths are ignored.

## Outputs

### `fails`

A space-separated list of files for which the check failed.

## Example usage

Create a workflow file, e.g., `.github/workflows/include-guards.yml`,
with the following content:
```yml
```

This Action allows you to send messages (and reactions/threads/update/blocks) to Slack from your Github Actions. Supports Slack\'s required arguments as well as all the optional once. It\'s JavaScript-based and thus fast to run.

The goal is to have zero npm/yarn dependencies except the two from Github that is required for an action to work (@actions/core & @actions/github).

![Slack result](./images/slack-result.png ""Slack result"")

This action is just an HTTPS call to Slack API, so you can easily build this by yourself, or use this action or any one of the hundred other Slack actions available.

## Requirements

1. Slack Workspace and Channel(s)
1. A Slack App and Bot - the App and Bot will be used to send messages to your channel. It sounds hard, but it\'s not :)
1. A Github Action - the place where you wants to send Slack messages
1. Github Secret - the Slack Bot auth token, used when posting messages to Slack API

## Important

With the latest changes to Slack API, please use channel id instead of channel name. E.g. use `CPPUV5KU0` instead of `test` (You can find the ID in the API calls or https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40940327/what-is-the-simplest-way-to-find-a-slack-team-id-and-a-channel-id)

## Setup

This action supports:

- 1. Send messages<br>

## How to setup your first Github Action in your repository that will call this Action

### 1. Create a Slack bot

Follow this guide on how to create a Slack App and Bot for your workspace:

- https://slack.com/intl/en-se/help/articles/115005265703-create-a-bot-for-your-workspace

You should:

1. Create a new Slack App, https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1
1. Go to ""Basic Information"" > ""Display Information"" > ""App icon & Preview"" and add avatar for you App. This will be shown in Slack when you receive messages
1. Go to ""Bot User"" > ""Add"" and add a bot user to your Slack App
1. Go to ""Install App"" > ""Install App to Workspace"" to install your Slack App into your Slack workspace
1. Done

### 2. Save Bot Access Token on Github

To be able to send messages to slack, the Action needs the Auth Token for the Slack App. Since the Auth Token is sensitive information, you should NOT place it in the yaml file of the Action, but instead in the Github Secrets area.

1. Go to your App on Slack, https://api.slack.com/apps/
1. Go to ""OAuth & Permissions"" > ""Bot User OAuth Access Token""
1. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`
1. Go to your Github Repo
1. Go to ""Settings"" > ""Secrets"" for the repo
1. Create a new secret called `SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value from `Bot User OAuth Access Token`
1. Done

### 2. Create a new Github Action

1. Go to your github repo
1. Go to actions
1. Create a new one, you can use the samples above

## Q&A

### It\'s not working

Please look at the individual steps on your Github Action. Maybe you have forgotten to set Channel or Token:

![Sample Error](./images/sample-error.png ""Sample Error"")

To debug action and see what payload is being sent to slack, enable debugging: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-debug-logging (`ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true` and `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true` under `Settings > Secrets`)

### What information about the repo etc is available?

You can easily print everything you have while running the action. It can be a good way to see what you can send to Slack.

```
```

From: https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions

### Why JavaScript and not Shell/etc?

_""JavaScript actions can run directly on any of the GitHub-hosted virtual machines, and separate the action code from the environment used to run the code. Using a JavaScript action simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action.""_

### How does the Action JavaScript code work

It\'s simple, it just takes all the parameters and does an HTTPS POST to api.slack.com.

### I want another avatar to be used in Slack

By default the avatar in Slack will be the same as for the Slack App you created. If you want to change this based on action, look at the https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage `icon_emoji` parameter.

### Why did you build your own?

It was a good way to learn more about Github Actions

### Why should I use this?

This action is just an HTTPS POST to Slack API, so you can easily build this by yourself, or use this, or use any other action available on the marketplace :)

## Development and testing

See package.json for `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, etc.

Remember to create the dist with `yarn build`.

To run local integration test (from this repository):

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ammaraskar/sphinx-action.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ammaraskar/sphinx-action)
[![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ammaraskar/sphinx-action/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ammaraskar/sphinx-action)


This is a Github action that looks for Sphinx documentation folders in your
project. It builds the documentation using Sphinx and any errors in the build
process are bubbled up as Github status checks.

The main purposes of this action are:

* Run a CI test to ensure your documentation still builds. 

* Allow contributors to get build errors on simple doc changes inline on Github
  without having to install Sphinx and build locally.
  
![Example Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Gk2W32O.png)

## How to use

Create a workflow for the action, for example:

```yaml
```

* If you have any Python dependencies that your project needs (themes, 
build tools, etc) then place them in a requirements.txt file inside your docs
folder.

* If you have multiple sphinx documentation folders, please use multiple
  `uses` blocks.

For a full example repo using this action including advanced usage, take a look
at https://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action-test

## Great Actions to Pair With

Some really good actions that work well with this one are
[`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
and [`ad-m/github-push-action`](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action).

You can use these to make built HTML and PDFs available as artifacts:

```yaml
```

Or to push docs changes automatically to a `gh-pages` branch:

<details><summary>Code for your workflow</summary>
<p>

```yaml
```

</p>
</details>

For a full fledged example of this in action take a look at:
https://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action-test

## Advanced Usage

If you wish to customize the command used to build the docs (defaults to
`make html`), you can provide a `build-command` in the `with` block. For
example, to invoke sphinx-build directly you can use:

```yaml
```

If there\'s system level dependencies that need to be installed for your
build, you can use the `pre-build-command` argument like so:

```yaml
```

## Running the tests

`python -m unittest`

# Snapcraft Build Action

This is a Github Action that can be used to build a
[Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io) project.  For most projects, the
following workflow should be sufficient:

```yaml
```

This will install and configure LXD and Snapcraft, then invoke
`snapcraft` to build the project.

It assumes that the Snapcraft project is at the root of the
repository.  If this is not the case, then the action can be
configured with the `path` input parameter:

```yaml
```

On success, the action will set the `snap` output parameter to the
path of the built snap.  This can be used to save it as an artifact of
the workflow:

```yaml
```

Alternatively, it could be used to perform further testing on the built snap:

```yaml

# Snapcraft Build Action

This is a Github Action that can be used to build a
[Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io) project.  For most projects, the
following workflow should be sufficient:

```yaml
```

This will install and configure LXD and Snapcraft, then invoke
`snapcraft` to build the project.

On success, the action will set the `snap` output parameter to the
path of the built snap.  This can be used to save it as an artifact of
the workflow:

```yaml
```

Alternatively, it could be used to perform further testing on the built snap:

```yaml
```

The action can also be chained with
[`snapcore/action-publish@v1`](https://github.com/snapcore/action-publish)
to automatically publish builds to the Snap Store.


## Action inputs

### `path`

If your Snapcraft project is not located in the root of the workspace,
you can specify an alternative location via the `path` input
parameter:

```yaml
```

### `build-info`

By default, the action will tell Snapcraft to include information
about the build in the resulting snap, in the form of the
`snap/snapcraft.yaml` and `snap/manifest.yaml` files.  Among other
things, these are used by the Snap Store\'s automatic security
vulnerability scanner to check whether your snap includes files from
vulnerable versions of Ubuntu packages.

This can be turned off by setting the `build-info` parameter to
`false`.

### `snapcraft-channel`

By default, the action will install Snapcraft from the stable
channel.  If your project relies on a feature not found in the stable
version of Snapcraft, then the `snapcraft-channel` parameter can be
used to select a different channel.

### `snapcraft-args`

The `snapcraft-args` parameter can be used to pass additional
arguments to Snapcraft.  This is primarily intended to allow the use
of experimental features by passing `--enable-experimental-*`
arguments to Snapcraft.

### `ua-token`

The `ua-token` parameter can be used to tell Snapcraft to attach an Ubuntu
Advantage (UA) token inside the build environment. Snapcraft will ensure
the token is detached before exiting, but be warned that it is possible
some failures may prevent detaching (e.g. aborted jobs).

In order to make the UA token available to the workflow, it should be stored
as a repository secret:

1. choose the ""Settings"" tab.
2. choose ""Secrets"" from the menu on the left.
3. click ""Add a new secret"".
4. set the name to `UA_TOKEN` (or whatever is referenced in the workflow),
   and paste the UA token as the value.

Note that repository secrets are not available to workflows triggered
by pull requests to public repositories.

An example workflow with UA token stored as secret `UA_TOKEN`:

```yaml
```

## Example usage

In each example below, replace the `master` branch reference in `@master` with the latest versioned branch available at the time you consume it.
This will help your consumption be stable even as we (may) make breaking changes.
You can always unlock new features in the Action by bumping the `v0.x` to v0.x+1 later.

### Using step outputs

```yaml
```

### Using environment variables

```yaml
```

### Stamp the version on a package.json file

```yaml
```

## Checkout requirements

Git history based versioning tools rely on history being included in the clone.
`actions/checkout@v1` does this by default.
But if you\'re using `actions/checkout@v2` you\'ll need to specify deep clone:

```yml
```

# A GitHub Action for Custom Jekyll Builds on GitHub Pages

A GitHub Action for building and deploying a Jekyll repo back to its `gh-pages` branch. 

**Why not just let GitHub Pages build it? Because this way we can use our own custom Jekyll plugins and build scripts.**

## Secrets
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: An access key which scoped to the repository - we need this to push the built site files back to the repo. This is generated for you on each workflow run\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94see usage in [example](#example). (GitHub Provides)
  
## Environment Variables
* `GITHUB_ACTOR`: Username of repo owner or object initiating the action (GitHub Provides)
* `GITHUB_REPO`: Owner/Repository (GitHub Provides)

## Example

```yml
```

Clones the repo, builds the site, and commits it back to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. That's it. Just add the above example to a `main.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository\xe2\x80\x94see caveats below. 

## Caveats

* `destination:` should be set to `./build` in your `_config.yml` file\xe2\x80\x94as God demands.
* A `Gemfile` is required. This must include `jekyll` and any other custom gems.

368,"# Jekyll Builder for GitHub Pages (Action)

Fast and simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) based on the official [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/jekyll/docker) `builder` image for building a Jekyll site and optionally deploying that site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* **Lightweight for fast builds.** The action\'s container image weighs in at ~80MB smaller than many comparable others.
* **Minimal configuration.** Smart defaults are automatically pulled from your GitHub account via the [GitHub v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
* **Observable and debug-able**. Clear logs with plenty of hints for what to do when a commit breaks the build. Debug the action itself just by running it with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `""true""`.
* **Batteries included**. Based on the official `jekyll/builder` Docker image so dependencies are always there when you need them.
* **Automatic updates**. Never update your pipeline manually if you don\'t want to. If you do, specify a version-pinned ref in your workflow for guaranteed stability.
* **Highlighy customizable**. Run custom commands before or after your build to easily smooth over any edge cases.
* **Pipeline-ready.** Safe for Continuous Delivery workflows because only real issues, not no-ops, cause build errors. 

This Action was created to be fast, simple, and versatile. It ships with smart defaults that are augmented at runtime with data pulled from the GitHub API, so you can keep your workflow file short and readable instead of spending time setting configuration inputs just to get the basics done. Use all the feautures of the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image and, if you need even more power, granting the action more privileges (by adding scopes to a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) used as the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable) will make it do more of the right things, automatically.

# Usage

In one of your [GitHub Actions workflow files](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file), add the following as [a step in a job](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):

```yaml
```

That\'s it. The action will use whatever source code is checked out from a previous [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) step as the Jekyll source to build. If the build succeeds, the step passes and the job continues with the next step.

For more details, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-actions-from-github-marketplace-in-your-workflow). For more common use cases, notably deploying to GitHub Pages, see [\xc2\xa7 Examples](#examples).

## Choosing a ref

Use the following guidance when choosing which ref (version) you want to base your work on:

* `v1` - This references the latest available 1.x.x version of the Action, which conforms with semantic versioning compatibility conventions. Use this ref in your workflow to gain backwards-compatible enhancements automatically. These versions will all be based on the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image\'s `latest` tag.
* `builder-3.8` - This reference is based on `jekyll/builder:3.8` and is considered a stable, legacy release. Use this ref in your workflow to stick to the given upstream tag.

## Inputs

You can customize this action by [using input variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).  Moreover,  *all inputs are optional*, so the action will still build your Jekyll site without any additional configuration. To enable deployments to GitHub Pages and other advanced features, some inputs are required as described below.

For additional details, inputs are well-commented in [the action\'s metadata file (`action.yaml`)](action.yaml).

### `gh_pages_publishing_source`

Name of the branch your repository is using as its GitHub Pages publishing source. This is the branch in your GitHub repository to which the Action will commit the result of the Jekyll build. Note that to deploy on GitHub Pages, you *must* first enable GitHub Pages from your repository\'s Settings screen and choose a GitHub Pages publishing source branch before using this Action.

When GitHub Pages is enabled, User and Organization repositories reserve the `master` branch as the GitHub Pages publishing source. This means you *must not* keep your own source code files in the `master` branch of User or Organization repositories when using this Action to automate deployments to GitHub Pages.

By default, this value is detected automatically if you have already [configured a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) in your repository settings and provided a [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable with appropriate permissions.

This option is ignored when the Action detects a [User or Organization repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites), because those types of GitHub Pages sites can only ever use their `master` branch as a publishing source. For Project repositories, this defaults to the value set in your repository\'s Settings screen (e.g., `gh-pages` branch).

### `git_commit_message`

When a commit to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch ([`gh_pages_publishing_source`](#gh_pages_publishing_source)) is made, this input variable defines the message to use. If none is specified, a generic default message will be used.

### `git_committer_email`

The email address to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the email associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow if the access token passed as the [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable has permission to access that data. If not, it will default to `""${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com""`.

### `git_committer_name`

The name to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the display name associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow.

### `jekyll_build_opts`

Extra arguments to pass to [the `jekyll build` command](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). This is particularly useful if your site requires non-default Jekyll build behaviors to be enabled. For example, to publish future-dated posts on your blog:

```yaml
```

See the output of `jekyll build --help` for more options.

### `pre_build_commands`

Set this input variable to a shell command or short inline shell script, which will be executed prior to the build. This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.

For example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.

```yaml
```

A more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):

```yaml
```

### `post_build_commands`

Exactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.

### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`

Set this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.

You should always set this input variable by using the `secrets` expression context provided by GitHub Actions runners:

```yaml
```

For more information, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

## Outputs

> :construction: TODO

The current version of this action does not produce any outputs. Hopefully, a future version will. :)

## Examples

This section offers some complete workflow examples to show you how to make use of this action.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

By default, when the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable is set, the action will deploy the Jekyll build to the GitHub Pages publishing source branch configured in your repository\'s GitHub Pages Settings section. This means you must first [configure a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) before using this action to deploy a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.

This input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token). Then navigate to your repository\'s Settings &rarr; Secrets screen and add a new secret whose value is exactly the same as the personal access token you created moments earlier. In the example configuration below, we assume you have created a repository secret named `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`.

```yaml
```

Using the above workflow file, anytime someone with the appropriate permissions pushes to the `jekyll` branch in your repository, this action will run. The `build-and-publish` job will `git checkout` the `jekyll` branch source code, which should contain your Jekyll site\'s source (not your generated HTML). Assuming the secret `GH_PAGES_TOKEN` contains a personal access token granted the sufficient permissions, the action will automatically detect the correct branch to `git commit` and `git push` your generated HTML to.

#### Automatically rebuilding a GitHub Pages site

You can schedule your workflow to run this action in order to keep your (otherwise static) GitHub Pages site content fresh This is particularly useful if your Jekyll templates show different content based on the date or time of the build, such as featuring your organization\'s next calendar event on the site\'s home page. Enable scheduled builds by adding a `schedule` key in the `on` dictionary from the above example:

```yaml
```

See [Events that trigger workflows \xc2\xa7 Scheduled events: `schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) for more information.

  ### Delete all pre-release versions except y latest pre-release package versions

  To delete all pre release versions except y latest pre-release package versions, the __package-name__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __delete-only-pre-release-versions__ inputs are required.

  __Example__

  Delete all pre-release package versions except latest 10

      package-type: \'npm\'
      min-versions-to-keep: 10
      delete-only-pre-release-versions: ""true""
  ```
  To delete all pre release versions except y latest pre-release package versions from a repo not having access to package, the __owner__, __package-name__, __token__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __delete-only-pre-release-versions__ inputs are required.

  __Example__

  Delete all pre-release package versions except latest 10 from a repo not having access to package

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v4
    with: 
      owner: \'github\'
      package-name: \'test-package\'
      package-type: \'npm\'
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}
      min-versions-to-keep: 10
      delete-only-pre-release-versions: ""true""
  ```

  <br>

  ### Delete all untagged container versions except y latest untagged versions

  To delete all untagged versions of a container package except y latest untagged versions, the __package-name__, __package-type__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __delete-only-untagged-versions__ inputs are required. __package-type__ must be container for this scenario.

  __Example__

  Delete all untagged versions except latest 10

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v4
    with: 
      package-name: \'test-package\'
      package-type: \'container\'
      min-versions-to-keep: 10
      delete-only-untagged-versions: \'true\'
  ```

  <br>

  ### Delete all except y latest versions while ignoring particular package versions

  To delete all except y latest versions while ignoring particular package versions, the __package-name__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __ignore-versions__ inputs are required.

  __Example__

      min-versions-to-keep: 3
      ignore-versions: \'^(0|[1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\.0\\\\.0$\'
  ```

  To delete all except y latest versions while ignoring particular package versions from a repo not having access to package, the __owner__, __package-name__, __token__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __ignore-versions__ inputs are required.

  The [token][token] needs the delete packages and read packages scope. It is recommended [to store the token as a secret][secret]. In this example the [token][token] was stored as a secret named __GITHUB_PAT__.

  __Example__

  Delete all except latest 3 package versions excluding major versions as per semver from a repo not having access to package

374,"# Setup Scala GitHub Action

A GitHub Action to install Java via [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) and
sbt.

- Configurable Java version: supports OpenJDK, GraalVM, Zulu and any other Java
  version that\'s installable via Jabba.
- Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, Windows.
- The `sbt` command is provided, with the official sbt launch script.
- The following alternate sbt launch scripts are also provided:
  - `sbtx` runs the [sbt-extras](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-extras/) launcher.
  - `csbt` runs the [Coursier-based sbt-extras](https://github.com/coursier/sbt-extras/) launcher.

## Usage:

In your GitHub Actions workflow, add a `uses:` declaration before calling the
`sbt` command.

```diff
```

The default Java version is the latest OpenJDK 8 HotSpot version via
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). To customize the Java version add a
`with:` declaration. For example, to use the latest AdoptOpenJDK 11 version

```diff
```

More Java version examples:

- `graalvm@`: the latest GraalVM
- `openjdk@1.14`: the latest OpenJDK 14 version
- `zulu@1.11`: the latest Zulu OpenJDK 11
- `graalvm@20.2.0=tgz+https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/download/vm-20.2.0/graalvm-ce-java11-linux-amd64-20.2.0.tar.gz`:
  custom Java version from a URL

## Tips and tricks

Some suggestions that may be helpful when using GitHub Actions.

### Disable `fail-fast` strategy

By default, GitHub Actions stops running jobs on the first failure. Add the
following configuration to ensure that all jobs run on every PR even if one job
fails.

```diff
```

### Browsing raw logs

Searching through large logs in the GitHub Actions web UI can be slow sometimes.
It can be faster to look at the raw logs instead.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xu29gwb.png)

### Configuring Windows jobs

When running jobs on Windows, you may want to default to the `bash` shell and
configure git to disable Windows line feeds.

```diff
```

### Faster checkout of big repos

Your repository can have a lot of commits, or branches with bulk resources. The
v2 version of `actions/checkout` doesn\'t fetch a whole repo by default that can
speed up builds greatly. But an additional configuration can be required to
fetch tags up to some level of depth for some builds which check binary
compatibility with previous tagged release from the branch.

Run open source security static analysis tools without the added complexity with OSSAR (Open Source Static Analysis Runner).

# Limitations

The OSSAR action is currently in beta and runs on the `windows-latest` queue, as well as Windows self hosted agents. `ubuntu-latest` support coming soon.

# Overview

This action runs the [Microsoft Security DevOps CLI](https://aka.ms/msdo-nuget) for security analysis by:

* Installing the Microsoft Security DevOps CLI
* Installing the latest policy or referencing the local `policy/github.gdnpolicy` file
* Installing the latest open source tools
* Automatic or user-provided configuration of static analysis tools
* Execution of a full suite of static analysis tools
* Normalized processing of results into the SARIF format
* Exports a single SARIF file which can be uploaded via the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action

# Open Source Tools

The following table documents what tools are currently run by this action (if applicable or configured) and the language(s) or artifact(s) they can analyze.

| Name | Analysis Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) | python |
| [BinSkim](https://github.com/Microsoft/binskim) | binary - Windows, ELF |
| [ESlint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) | JavaScript |

To request a tool be integrated, please file a [new a GitHub issue](https://github.com/github/ossar-action/issues/new) in this repo.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic

Run OSSAR with the default policy and recommended tools.

```yaml
```

**Note:** The [Microsoft Security DevOps CLI](https://aka.ms/msdo-nuget) is built with net6.0. A version greater than or equal to net6.0 of dotnet must be installed on the runner in order to run this action. GitHub hosted runners already have a compatible version of dotnet installed. To ensure a compatible version of dotnet is installed on a self-hosted runner, please configure the [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) action.

```
```

## Upload Results to the Security tab

To upload results to the Security tab of your repo, run the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` action immediately after running OSSAR. OSSAR sets the action output variable `sarifFile` to the path of a single SARIF file that can be uploaded to this API.

```yaml
```

# Report Issues

Please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/github/ossar-action/issues/new) in this repo. To help us investigate the issue, please include a description of the problem, a link to your workflow run (if public), and/or logs from the OSSAR's action output.

***********************

|Test Status| |PyPI Version| |conda-forge version| |Read the Docs Status|

Automatic Semantic Versioning for Python projects. This is a Python
implementation of `semantic-release`_ for JS by Stephan B\xc3\xb6nnemann. If
you find this topic interesting you should check out his `talk from
JSConf Budapest`_.

The general idea is to be able to detect what the next version of the
project should be based on the commits. This tool will use that to
automate the whole release, upload to an artifact repository and post changelogs to
GitHub. You can run the tool on a CI service, or just run it locally.

Installation
============

::

  python3 -m pip install python-semantic-release
  semantic-release --help

Python Semantic Release is also available from `conda-forge`_ or as a `GitHub Action`_.
Read more about the setup and configuration in our `getting started guide`_.

379,"# Log in to a container registry\r
Use this GitHub Action to [log in to a private container registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/). Once login is done, the next set of actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
Refer to the action metadata file for details about all the inputs: [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login/blob/master/action.yml)\r
\r
When using the docker-login action, ensure your login-server matches the fully qualified path to your image. You should omit login-server if you are pushing to the default docker hub without a host prefix, for instance, `docker push repo/image`. You'll need to specify a login-server if you are using the fully qualified path: `docker push index.docker.io/repo/image`. \r
\r
## Logging in to multiple registries\r
To log in to multiple registries, simply run this action several times with different credentials; they will accumulate.\r
\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
## You can build and push container registry by using the following example\r
```yaml\r
```\r
\r
### Prerequisite\r
Get the username and password of your container registry and create secrets for them. For Azure Container registry refer to **admin [account document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account)** for username and password.\r
\r
Now add the username and password as [a secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/) in the GitHub repository.\r

deploy it to GitHub Pages for you! Here\'s a basic workflow example:

```yml
```

> **NOTE:** In order to support `npm` and `yarn`, this Action relies on having a
> `build` script defined in your `package.json` file. Gatsby automatically defines
> this script whenever you start a new project via `gatsby new`, which in turn calls
> `gatsby build`.

### Knobs & Handles

This Action is fairly simple but it does provide you with a couple of
configuration options:

- **access-token**: A [GitHub Personal Access Token][github-access-token] with
  the `repo` scope. This is **required** to push the site to your repo after
  Gatsby finish building it. You should store this as a [secret][github-repo-secret]
  in your repository. Provided as an [input][github-action-input].

- **deploy-branch**: The branch expected by GitHub to have the static files
  needed for your site. For org and user pages it should always be `master`.
  This is where the output of `gatsby build` will be pushed to. Provided as an
  [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to `master`.

- **deploy-repo**: The repository expected by GitHub to have the static files
  needed for your site.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to the same repository that runs this action.

- **gatsby-args**: Additional arguments that get passed to `gatsby build`. See the
  [Gatsby documentation][gatsby-build-docs] for a list of allowed options.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to nothing.

- **skip-publish**: Builds your Gatsby site but skips publishing by setting it to `true`,
  effectively performing a test of the build process using the live configuration.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to **false**

- **working-dir**: The directory where your Gatsby source files are at. `gatsby build`
  will run from this directory.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to the project\'s root.
  
- **git-config-name**: Provide a custom name that is used to author the git commit, which
  is pushed to the deploy branch.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to the GitHub username of the action actor.

- **git-config-email**: Provide a custom email that is used to author the git commit, which
  is pushed to the deploy branch.
  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].
  Defaults to `{actor}@users.noreply.github.com`, where `{actor}` is the GitHub username 
  of the action actor.
  
### Org or User Pages

Create a repository with the format `<YOUR/ORG USERNAME>.github.io`, push your
Gatsby source code to a branch other than `master` and add this GitHub Action to
your workflow! \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x98\x83

### Repository Pages

Repo pages give you the option to push your static site to either `master` or
`gh-pages` branches. They also work a little different because the URL includes
a trailing path with the repository name, like
`https://username.github.io/reponame/`. You need to tell Gatsby what the path
prefix is via `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
```

Additionally, you need to tell the `gatsby build` command to use it by passing
the `--prefix-paths` as an argument. Here\'s an example workflow for that:

```yml
          deploy-branch: gh-pages
          gatsby-args: --prefix-paths
```

Provides build validation on `pull request` if required:

```yml
```

### CNAME

You have a custom domain you would like to use? Fancy! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e This Action\'s got you
covered! Assuming you have already set up your DNS provider as defined in the
[GitHub Pages docs][github-pages-domain-docs], all we need next is a `CNAME`
file at the root of your project with the domain you would like to use. For
example:

```CNAME
```

> Notice that it\'s **all capitals CNAME** \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a.

This is how GitHub keeps track of the domain you want to use. This action will
copy the file to the `public` directory generated by Gatsby before pushing your
site so that the domain is persisted between deploys.

### Assumptions

This Action assumes that your Gatsby code sits at the root of your repository
and `gatsby build` outputs to the `public` directory. As of this writing, Gatsby
doesn\'t provide a way to customize the build directory so this should be a safe
assumption.

Additionally, a `build` script on `package.json` is expected for this Action to
to work (as mentioned at the beginning). Ultimately, this is what calls `gatsby build`.

## That\'s It

Have fun building! \xe2\x9c\xa8

<a href=""https://github.com/clupprich/ruby-build-action""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/clupprich/ruby-build-action/workflows/Tests/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflows) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

* `ruby-version` - The version of Ruby you want to install
* `cache-available` - A flag if a cached Ruby installation is available (see [the examples](#example-workflows) below)

### Outputs

* `ruby-path` - The path to the Ruby exectuable that was installed

### Example workflows

```yaml
```

Note that installing Ruby from source is slow. However, you can cache the installation by using the [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache) action, which is available as a preview right now:


```yaml
```

This runs way faster (we still need to install a couple of packages via `apt-get install`, though): The uncached version takes around 4 minutes to complete, the cached version 30 seconds.

# Management of Toit\xc5\xab Te Whenua LINZ\'s Software Repository

GitHub action to build Ubuntu packages.

## Use

See [`action.yml`](action.yml) for parameter definitions.

Example:

```yaml
```

To build the package without publishing it, just remove the `packagecloud` parameters above.

When publishing to the \'test\' repository the action will also try to push changes to
debian/changelog file back to the origin, together with a `debian/xxx` tag. In order for the action
to have credentials to push these objects you\'ll need to set the ""origin"" url to include the
authentication token. Note that the token must belong to a user who has permissions to push to all
branches containing the initial reference from the checked out repository (which reference is
checked out depends on the action triggering the event). Protected branches can get in your way!

```yaml
```

## Manual test

1. Build the builder container in this repository:
   `nix-shell --pure --run \'docker build --tag=docker-builder .\'`.
1. Build the project:
   `docker run --env=DRY_RUN=1 --env=GITHUB_REPOSITORY=GITHUB_REPOSITORY --env=RUNNER_WORKSPACE=WORKSPACE --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker-builder RELEASE PACKAGES`
   - [`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is as defined in the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)
   - `WORKSPACE` is the _parent_ directory of the project
   - The rest of the parameters are as shown in the [use example](#use)

## Release procedure

Using the above, how do you actually release? If you want to release a release:

1. Go to the relevant repository.
1. Update local tags using `git fetch --tags`.
1. Check `git tag` for the latest released version.
1. Depending on whether this is a major (X+1.0.0), minor (X.Y+1.0), or patch (X.Y.Z+1) release:
   - If this is a major or minor release, create a `release-X.Y` branch.
   - If this is a patch release, check out the existing `release-X.Y` branch.
1. Add a change log entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Look for anywhere there is a list of version numbers, such as the Makefile, test files, or
   others. In all those places, add your new version and add an issue to fix it so that the code
   looks up all the relevant versions by their tags.
1. Do your changes on this branch.
1. Push the branch.
1. Create a pull request for the branch.
1. Wait for the pull request to build.
1. Tag the final commit on the branch with `X.Y.Z`, for example, `1.10.2`.
1. `git push origin TAG` with the tag created above.
1. Verify that all the release jobs succeed.
1. Wait for the package to appear in the [test repository](https://packagecloud.io/linz/test).
1. Manually promote the package from the test repository to production.
1. Wait for the pull request to build with the Debian packaging changelog commit and merge it.

Only at this point is it safe to rely on the new version, because dependee repositories rely on the
state of the `master` branch in their pipelines. :\'(

385,"# GitHub YAMLlint

This action executes `yamllint` (https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) against files or folder

## Usage

Simple as:

```yaml
```

### Optional input parameters

- `config_file` - Path to custom configuration
- `config_data` - Custom configuration (as YAML source)
- `file_or_dir` - Enter file/folder (space separated), wildcards accepted. Examples:
  - `.` - run against all yaml files in a directory recursively (default)
  - `file1.yaml`
  - `file1.yaml file2.yaml`
  - `kustomize/**/*.yaml mychart/*values.yaml`
- `format` - Format for parsing output `[parsable,standard,colored,github,auto] (default: parsable)`
- `strict` - Return non-zero exit code on warnings as well as errors `[true,false] (default: false)`
- `no_warnings` - Output only error level problems `[true,false] (default: false)`

**Note:** If `.yamllint` configuration file exists in your root folder, yamllint automatically uses it.

### Outputs

`logfile` - Path to yamllint log file

`${{ steps.<step>.outputs.logfile }}`

**Note:** Each yamllint run (for example if you define multiple yamllint steps) has its own log

### Example usage in workflow

```yaml
```

Or just simply lint all yaml files in the repository:

```yaml
```

Config data examples:

```yaml
```

``` yaml
```

Use output to save/upload the log in artifact. Note, you must have `id` in the step running the yamllint action.

386,"# Create or Update Pull Request action

> A GitHub Action to create or update a pull request based on local changes

## Usage

Minimal workflow example

```yml
```

`persist-credentials: false` is crucial otherwise Git push is performed with `github.token` and not the token you configure using the `env: GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Customizations

```yml
```

**Note:** `auto-merge` is optional. It can be set to `merge`, `squash`, or `rebase`. If [auto-merging](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request) is disabled in the repository, a warning will be logged, but the action will not fail.

To create multiple commits for different paths, use the action multiple times

```yml
```

## Debugging

To see additional debug logs, create a secret with the name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and value `true`. There is no need to pass it as `env` to steps, it will work globally.

## How it works

The actions checks for local changes which can be

1. Uncommitted changes such as created, updated or deleted files as shown by `git status`
2. Local commits

If there are none, the action concludes with the ""neutral"" status

If there are changes, it does the following

1. Sets `user.name` and `user.email` with `git config --global` based on the `author` input, unless it has been already set before.
2. Looks for local changes with `git status`.
3. Adds a new commit using the `commit-message` input if there are uncommitted changes.
4. Pushes the local changes to remote using the branch configured in the `branch` input.
5. Creates a pull request using the `title` and `body` inputs. If a pull request exists for the branch, it\'s checked out locally, rebased with `-XTheirs` and pushed with `--force` to update the pull request with the new changes.

The actions outputs following properties:

- `pull-request-number` - number of created/updated PR. Not set if result is `unchanged`.
- `result` - `created`, `updated` or `unchanged` based if the PR was created, updated or if there were no local changes.

The action is written in JavaScript. [Learn how to create your own](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-javascript-action).

# Delete artifacts

A GitHub Action for deleting artifacts within the workflow run. This can be useful when artifacts are shared across jobs, but are no longer needed when the workflow is complete.

## \xe2\x9a\xa1 Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

> **Warning**
> From version 2 onwards, glob (wildcard) support is on by default, and is fulfilled by [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch); this can be disabled by setting `useGlob` to `false`.

### Delete an individual artifact

```yml
```

### Specify multiple names

```yml
```

## \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa8 Error vs Fail

By default, the action will fail when it was not possible to delete an artifact (with the exception of name mismatches). When the deletion of an artifact is not integral to the success of a workflow, it is possible to error without failure. All errors are logged.

```yml
```

```yml
with:
  ignore_words_file: .codespellignore
```

### Parameter: ignore_words_list

Comma-separated list of words which will be ignored by `codespell`.
Words are case sensitive based on how they are written in the dictionary file.

with:
  ignore_words_list: abandonned,ackward
```

### Parameter: uri_ignore_words_list

Comma-separated list of words which will be ignored by `codespell` in URIs and emails only.
Words are case sensitive based on how they are written in the dictionary file.

This parameter is optional; by default `codespell` will check all URIs and emails for typos.

```yml
with:
  uri_ignore_words_list: abandonned
```

### Parameter: path

Indicates the path to run `codespell` in.
This can be useful if your project has code you don\'t want to spell check for some reason.

```yml
with:
  path: src
```

### Parameter: only_warn

Only warn about problems.
All errors and warnings are annotated in Pull Requests, but it will act like everything was fine anyway.
(In other words, the exit code is always 0.)

This parameter is optional; setting this to any value will enable it.

```yml

### Parameter: error_classes

List of flake8 [error classes](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-error-class) to classify as Error.

This parameter is optional; by default `E` and `F` classes will be considered errors.

```
  with:
    error_classes: E,H
```

### Parameter: warning_classes

List of flake8 [error classes](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-error-class) to classify as Warning.

This problem matcher lets you show errors from GNU `sort` as annotation in
GitHub Actions.

Based on [korelstar](https://github.com/korelstar)'s [xmllint-problem-matcher](https://github.com/korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher).

## Inputs

No inputs are required.

## Outputs

No outputs are generated apart from a configured problem matcher.

## Usage

Add the step to your workflow, before `sort -c` is called.

392,"# cache

This GitHub Action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.

<a href=""https://github.com/actions/cache""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/cache/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push""></a>

## Documentation

See [""Caching dependencies to speed up workflows""](https://help.github.com/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).

## Usage

### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

* `path` - A directory to store and save the cache
* `key` - An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache
* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of keys to use for restoring the cache if no cache hit occurred for key

### Outputs

* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key

> See [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#Skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output

### Example workflow

```yaml
```

## Ecosystem Examples

See [Examples](examples.md)

## Cache Limits

Individual caches are limited to 400MB and a repository can have up to 2GB of caches. Once the 2GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.

## Skipping steps based on cache-hit

Using the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.

Example:
```yaml
```

> Note: The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)

393,"# automerge-action

GitHub action to automatically merge pull requests when they are ready.

<img src=""https://pascalgn.github.io/automerge-action/screenshot.svg"" width=""100%"">

When added, this action will run the following tasks on pull requests with the
`automerge` label:

- Changes from the base branch will automatically be merged into the pull
  request (only when ""Require branches to be up to date before merging""
  is enabled in the branch protection rules)
- When the pull request is ready, it will automatically be merged. The action
  will only wait for status checks that are marked as required in the branch
  protection rules
- Pull requests without any configured labels will be ignored

Labels, merge and update strategies are configurable, see [Configuration](#configuration).

A pull request is considered ready when:

1. the required number of review approvals has been given (if enabled in the
   branch protection rules) and
2. the required checks have passed (if enabled in the branch protection rules)
   and
3. the pull request is up to date (if enabled in the branch protection rules)

After the pull request has been merged successfully, the branch will _not_ be
deleted. To delete branches after they are merged,
see [automatic deletion of branches](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches).

----

**This functionality is now available directly in GitHub as [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request).** Note that GitHub does not currently support auto-rebasing pull requests. The automerge-action project will still be maintained, but users are encouraged to switch to auto-merge for simple workflows, as it offers a faster and more stable experience.

## Usage

Create a new `.github/workflows/automerge.yml` file:

```yaml
```

For the latest version, see the [list of releases](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action/releases).

## Configuration

The following merge options are supported:

- `MERGE_LABELS`: The labels that need to be present for a pull request to be
  merged (using `MERGE_METHOD`). The default value is `automerge`.

  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels that will be checked. All
  labels in the list need to be present, otherwise the pull request will be
  skipped (until all labels are present). Labels prefixed with an exclamation
  mark (`!`) will block a pull request from being merged, when present.

  For example, when `automerge,!wip,!work in progress` is given,
  any pull requests with the labels `wip` or `work in progress` and any pull
  requests _without_ the label `automerge` will not be merged.
  Blocking labels take precedence, so if a pull request has both labels
  `wip` and `automerge`, it will not be merged.

  When an empty string (`""""`) is given, all pull requests will be merged.

- `MERGE_REMOVE_LABELS`: The labels to automatically remove from a pull request
  once it has been merged by the action. The default value is `""""`.

  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels that will be removed.

  When an empty string (`""""`) is given, no labels will be removed.

- `MERGE_METHOD`: Which method to use when merging the pull request into
  the base branch. Possible values are
  [`merge`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges) (create a merge commit),
  [`rebase`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
  (rebase all commits of the branch onto the base branch)
  or [`squash`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
  (squash all commits into a single commit). The default option is `merge`.

- `MERGE_METHOD_LABELS`: Set to allow labels to determine the merge method
  (see `MERGE_METHOD` for possible values).
  For example, `automerge=merge,autosquash=squash`. If no such label is present,
  the method set by `MERGE_METHOD` will be used. The default value is `""""`.

- `MERGE_METHOD_LABEL_REQUIRED`: Set to `""true""` to require one of the
  `MERGE_METHOD_LABELS` to be set. The default value is `""false""`.

- `MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message to use when merging the pull
  request into the base branch. Possible values are `automatic` (use GitHub\'s
  default message), `pull-request-title` (use the pull request\'s title),
  `pull-request-description` (use the pull request\'s description),
  `pull-request-title-and-description` or a literal
  value with optional placeholders (for example `Auto merge {pullRequest.number}`).
  The default value is `automatic`.

- `MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE_REGEX`: When using a commit message containing the
  PR\'s body, use the first capturing subgroup from this regex as the commit
  message. Can be used to separate content that should go with the commit into
  the code base\'s history from boilerplate associated with the PR (licensing
  notices, check lists, etc). For example, `(.*)^---` would keep everything up
  until the first 3-dash line (horizontal rule in MarkDown) from the commit
  message. The default value is empty, which disables this feature.

- `MERGE_FILTER_AUTHOR`: When set, only pull requests raised by this author
  will be merged automatically.

- `MERGE_FORKS`: Whether merging from external repositories is enabled
  or not. By default, pull requests with branches from forked repositories will
  be merged the same way as pull requests with branches from the main
  repository. Set this option to `""false""` to disable merging of pull requests
  from forked repositories. The default value is `""true""`.

- `MERGE_RETRIES` and `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP`: Sometimes, the pull request check
  runs haven\'t finished yet, so the action will retry the merge after some time.
  The number of retries can be set with `MERGE_RETRIES`.
  The default number of retries is `6` and setting it to `0` disables the retry logic.
  `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP` sets the time to sleep between retries, in milliseconds.
  The default is `5000` (5 seconds) and setting it to `0` disables sleeping
  between retries.

- `MERGE_REQUIRED_APPROVALS`: Count of required approvals. The default is `0`.

- `MERGE_DELETE_BRANCH`: Automatic deletion of branches does not work for all
  repositories. Set this option to `""true""` to automatically delete branches
  after they have been merged. The default value is `""false""`.

- `MERGE_DELETE_BRANCH_FILTER`: A comma-separated list of branches that will not
  be deleted. This is not the list of GitHub\'s protected branches, which are never
  deleted, but an additional list of branches to protect. The default value is `""""`.

- `MERGE_ERROR_FAIL`: Set this to `""true""` to have the action exit with error code `1`
  when the pull request could not be merged successfully during a run.

- `MERGE_READY_STATE`: The state(s) of a pull request for which to attempt a
  merge. This option can be a comma-separated list of states that will be considered mergeable.
  The default value is `clean,has_hooks,unknown,unstable`.

The following update options are supported:

- `UPDATE_LABELS`: The labels that need to be present for a pull request to be
  updated (using `UPDATE_METHOD`). The default value is `automerge`.

  Note that updating will only happen when the option ""Require branches to be
  up to date before merging"" is enabled in the branch protection rules.

  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels, see the `MERGE_LABELS`
  option for more information.

- `UPDATE_METHOD`: Which method to use when updating the pull request
  to the base branch. Possible values are `merge` (create a merge commit) or
  `rebase` (rebase the branch onto the head of the base branch). The default
  option is `merge`.

  When the option is `rebase` and the [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
  failed, the action will exit with error code 1. This will also be visible
  in the pull request page, with a message like ""this branch has conflicts
  that must be resolved"" and a list of conflicting files.

- `UPDATE_RETRIES` and `UPDATE_RETRY_SLEEP`: Sometimes, the pull request check
  runs haven\'t finished yet and the action doesn\'t know if an update is
  necessary. To query the pull request state multiple times, the number of
  retries can be set with `UPDATE_RETRIES`. The default number of retries is `1`
  and setting it to `0` disables the retry logic.
  `UPDATE_RETRY_SLEEP` sets the time to sleep between retries, in milliseconds.
  The default is `5000` (5 seconds) and setting it to `0` disables sleeping
  between retries.

Also, the following general options are supported:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should always be `""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""`.
  However, in some cases it can be useful to run this action as a certain user
  (by default, it will run as `github-actions`). This can be useful if you want
  to use the ""Restrict who can push to matching branches"" option in the branch
  protection rules, for example.

  To use this setting for manually providing a token, you need to create a
  [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
  for the user (make sure to check `public_repo` when it\'s a public repository
  or `repo` when it\'s a private repository). All API requests (merge/rebase)
  will then be executed as the specified user. The token should be kept secret,
  so make sure to add it as secret, not as environment variable, in the GitHub
  workflow file!

- `PULL_REQUEST`: If provided, this action will attempt to merge the specified pull request. By default, it will attempt to use the pull request specified in the GitHub context. If a pull request number is provided via this input, this action will search in the current repo for the provided pull request number. If you want to merge a pull request in another repo, just provide the repo slug before the pull request number, like `Some-Org/Some-Repo/1234`

- `BASE_BRANCHES`: If provided, the action will be restricted in terms of base branches. Can be comma-separated list of simple branch names (i.e `main,dev`).

You can configure the environment variables in the workflow file like this:

```yaml
```

## Supported Events

Automerge can be configured to run for these events:

* `check_run`
* `check_suite`
* `issue_comment`
* `pull_request_review`
* `pull_request_target`
* `pull_request`
* `push`
* `repository_dispatch`
* `schedule`
* `status`
* `workflow_dispatch`
* `workflow_run`

For more information on when these occur, see the Github documentation on [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) and [their payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads).

## Outputs

The action will provide two [outputs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs):

* `mergeResult` - The result from the action run, one of `skipped`, `not_ready`, `author_filtered`, `merge_failed`, `merged`
* `pullRequestNumber` - The pull request number (or `0`, if no pull request was affected)

Please note:

1. When there are multiple pull requests affected, only the first one will be available in the output
2. To access these outputs, your workflow configuration must define an `id` for the automerge-action step
3. Unless a personal access token is used, this action will not trigger other actions, see [Limitations](#limitations)

Example usage:

```yaml
```

## Limitations

- When a pull request is merged by this action, the merge will not trigger other GitHub workflows.
  Similarly, when another GitHub workflow creates a pull request, this action will not be triggered.
  This is because [an action in a workflow run can\'t trigger a new workflow run](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows). However, the [`workflow_run`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run) event is triggered as expected.
- When [using a personal access token (PAT) to work around the above limitation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token), note that when the user issuing the PAT is an administrator and [branch restrictions do not include administrators](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-branch-restrictions), pull requests may be merged even if they are not mergeable for non-administrators (see [#65](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action/issues/65)).
- Currently, there is no way to trigger workflows when the pull request branch
  becomes out of date with the base branch. There is a request in the
  [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/New-Trigger-is-mergable-state/m-p/36908).

## Debugging

To run the action with full debug logging, update your workflow file as follows:

```yaml
```

If you need to further debug the action, you can run it locally.

You will need a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

Then clone this repository, create a file `.env` in the repository, such as:

```
```

Install dependencies with `yarn`, and finally run `yarn it` (or `npm run it`).

### Brief Summary\r
\r
The action is compatible with [actions/setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby), and can be used with all OS's.\r
\r
When the OS is Windows, it installs current Ruby versions, and also allows one to run jobs based on Ruby 2.3 or master.  Simple MYS2/DevKit operations are also included.\r
\r
Othere OS's use the standard GitHub Actions Ruby versions.\r
\r
### Usage\r
\r
The following runs 12 jobs (3 OS's, 4 Rubies).  On Windows, it updates the MSYS2/DevKit gcc tools and installs the proper version of OpenSSL.\r
```yaml\r

### How long does it take?\r
\r
Installing current Rubies takes about 10 seconds for the GitHub hosted Rubies, about 15 - 20 seconds for ruby-head.\r
\r
Installing current Rubies and updating the gcc tools takes +/- 2 minutes.\r
\r
### General\r
\r
This repo contains a GitHub action that will install current Ruby x64-mingw32 versions for use with GitHub Actions Windows images.\r
\r
As of 2019-10-28, the versions available are:\r
```\r
```\r
\r
Ruby master is also available, use '9.9.x' in the matrix.  At present, it is hosted on Appveyor, where it is built three times a day.  I intend to move it to GitHub in the near future.\r
\r
All versions except master are RubyInstaller2 versions, with the html docs removed.  Removing the docs decreases the number of extracted files & folders by approx 2,400 items.\r
\r
The matrix is compatible with the standard [`actions/setup-ruby@v1`](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby) action published by GitHub.\r
\r
### MSYS2 Issues\r
\r
Actions' current mingw Rubies were built with gcc 8.3.0.  The DevKit/MSYS2 installs contain gcc 7.2.0. A new or updated MSYS2 installation uses gcc is 9.2.0.\r
\r
The Ubuntu 16.04 Rubies were built with gcc 5.4.0, Ubuntu 18.04 Rubies were built with gcc 7.4.0.\r
\r
So, if you'd like to use a curent gcc compiler, updating the MSYS2 gcc tools to 9.2.0 is the easiest way to do so.\r
\r
For reference, see [MSP-Greg/github-actions-ruby-info](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/github-actions-ruby-info/actions) for information on current GitHub Actions Rubies.  Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.04, macOS, and windows-latest are shown.\r
\r
### Ruby 2.3.3\r
\r
Ruby 2.3.3 was built with a proprietary version of MSYS.  Generally, an *.so file shouldn't be incompatible with other files built with different tools.\r
\r
### Why master?\r
\r
Since the Ruby versions may change (think Christmas), using master means that use in CI doesn't need to change versions every year...\r

395,"# npm-publish-action

GitHub action to automatically publish packages to npm.

## Usage

Create a new `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` file:

```yaml
```

Now, when someone changes the version in `package.json` to 1.2.3 and pushes a commit with the message `Release 1.2.3`, the `npm-publish` action will create a new tag `v1.2.3` and publish the package to the npm registry.

### Inputs

These inputs are optional: that means that if you don\'t enter them, default values will be used and it\'ll work just fine.

- `tag_name`: the name pattern of the new tag
- `tag_message`: the message pattern of the new tag
- `create_tag`: whether to create a git tag or not (defaults to `""true""`)
- `commit_pattern`: pattern that the commit message needs to follow
- `workspace`: custom workspace directory that contains the `package.json` file
- `publish_command`: custom publish command (defaults to `yarn`)
- `publish_args`: publish command arguments (for example `--prod --verbose`, defaults to empty)

### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: this is a token that GitHub generates automatically, you only need to pass it to the action as in the example
- `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`: this is the token the action will use to authenticate to [npm](https://npmjs.com). You need to generate one in npm, then you can add it to your secrets (settings -> secrets) so that it can be passed to the action. DO NOT put the token directly in your workflow file.

## Related projects

- [npm-publish](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish) is a similar project
- [version-check](https://github.com/EndBug/version-check) allows to define custom workflows based on version changes

This action sets up a Python environment with Nox by:

- Activating every version of Python that GitHub Actions supports.
- Installing Nox.

After you use it, you\'ll be able to use Nox with [every Python version available on GitHub Actions][actions-installed]. Nox itself will be installed in the newest available Python version.

This action runs in the GitHub Actions environment itself and not in Docker, which means it works on Linux, Windows and macOS, but only with the available Python versions. If you need Python versions outside that, but you only need Linux, you can also try the [thekevjames/nox Docker images][nox-docker].

398,"# install-nix-action

![GitHub Actions badge](https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action/workflows/install-nix-action%20test/badge.svg)

Installs [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) on GitHub Actions for the supported platforms: Linux and macOS.

By default it has no nixpkgs configured, you have to set `nix_path`
by [picking a channel](https://status.nixos.org/)
or [pin nixpkgs yourself](https://nix.dev/reference/pinning-nixpkgs)
(see also [pinning tutorial](https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs)).

# Features

- Quick installation (~4s on Linux, ~20s on macOS)
- Multi-User installation (with sandboxing enabled only on Linux)
- [Self-hosted GitHub runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) support
- Allows specifying Nix installation URL via `install_url` (the oldest supported Nix version is 2.3.5)
- Allows specifying extra Nix configuration options via `extra_nix_config`
- Allows specifying `$NIX_PATH` and channels via `nix_path`
- Share `/nix/store` between builds using [cachix-action](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action) for simple binary cache setup to speed up your builds and share binaries with your team
- Enables `flakes` and `nix-command` experimental features by default (to disable, set `experimental-features` via `extra_nix_config`)

## Usage

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repo with the following contents:

```yaml
```

## Usage with Flakes

```yaml
```

To install Nix from any commit, go to [the corresponding installer_test action](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/runs/2219534360) and click on ""Run cachix/install-nix-action@XX"" step and expand the first line.

## Inputs (specify using `with:`)

- `extra_nix_config`: append to `/etc/nix/nix.conf`

- `github_access_token`: configure Nix to pull from GitHub using the given GitHub token. This helps work around rate limit issues. Has no effect when `access-tokens` is also specified in `extra_nix_config`.

- `install_url`: specify URL to install Nix from (useful for testing non-stable releases or pinning Nix, for example https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.3.7/install)

- `install_options`: additional installer flags passed to the installer script.

- `nix_path`: set `NIX_PATH` environment variable, for example `nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable`

## FAQ

### How do I print nixpkgs version I have configured?

```yaml
```

### How do I run NixOS tests?

With the following inputs:

```yaml
```

[Note that there\'s no hardware acceleration on GitHub Actions.](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/183#issuecomment-610723516).

### How do I install packages via nix-env from the specified `nix_path`?

```
```

### How do I add a binary cache?

If the binary cache you want to add is hosted on [Cachix](https://cachix.org/) and you are
using [cachix-action](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action), you
should use their `extraPullNames` input like this:

```yaml
```

Otherwise, you can add any binary cache to nix.conf using
install-nix-action\'s own `extra_nix_config` input:

```yaml
```

### How do I pass environment variables to commands run with `nix develop` or `nix shell`?

Nix runs commands in a restricted environment by default, called `pure mode`.
In pure mode, environment variables are not passed through to improve the reproducibility of the shell.

You can use the `--keep / -k` flag to keep certain environment variables:

```yaml
```

Or you can disable pure mode entirely with the `--impure` flag:

```
```

399,"# cachix-action

![github actions badge](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action/workflows/cachix-action%20test/badge.svg)

One nice benefit of Nix is that CI can build and cache developer environments for every project on every branch using binary caches.

Another important aspect of CI is the feedback loop of how many minutes does the build take to finish.

With a simple configuration using Cachix, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have to build any derivation twice and share them with all your developers.

After each job, just built derivations are pushed to your binary cache.

Before each job, derivations to be built are first substituted (if they exist) from your binary cache.

## Getting started

Follow [Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/continuous-integration-github-actions) tutorial.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for all options.

## Security

Cachix auth token and signing key need special care as they give read and write access to your caches.

[As per GitHub Actions' security model](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow):

> Anyone with write access to a repository can create, read, and use secrets.

Which means all developers with write/push access can read your secrets and write to your cache. 

Pull requests do not have access to secrets so read access to a public binary cache will work,
but pushing will be disabled since there is no signing key.

Note that malicious code submitted via a pull request can, once merged into `master`, reveal the tokens.

===============================

[<img src=""https://github.com/manusa/actions-publish-docker/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg"" />](https://github.com/manusa/actions-publish-docker/actions)

This GitHub action allows you to create and publish Docker images into a Docker registry.

## Usage

### Basic

```yaml
```

### Required input parameters

| Parameter  | Description                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| `name`     | Name of the Docker image     |
| `username` | Username for Docker registry |
| `password` | Password for Docker registry |

By default the published image will be tagged using the git branch or tag name (`master` branch
will be tagged as `latest`).

### Optional input parameters

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tag`                   | Tag for the Docker image                                                                                                                                                |
| `tag script`            | Script to compute tag name for the Docker image, receives `context` as a variable. Ignored if used together with `tag` parameter                                        |
| `registry`              | URL for the Docker registry to login                                                                                                                                    |
| `include pull requests` | By default (to avoid accidents) action is ignored in pull requests. This parameter will force publishing the image even if the action was triggered from a pull request |
| `dockerfile path`       | By default the path to the `Dockerfile` is `.`, this parameter lets you change this.                                                                                    |

### Advanced

402,"# Backport Bot

Backport Bot is a [JavaScript GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) to backport a pull request by simply adding a label to it.

It can backport [rebased and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests with a single commit, [pull requests merged with a merge commit](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) as well as [squashed and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests. It thus integrates well with [Autosquash](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autosquash).

This version even works on forked repositories!

## Usage

1. :electric_plug: Add this [.github/workflows/backport.yml](.github/workflows/backport.yml) to your repository.
2. :guardsman: Create a user for the bot. Set this username in backport.yml
3. :scissors: With this user, fork your repository.
4. :key: Generate a personal access token with this user. Give it only the ""public_repo"" permission.
5. :unlock: Setup this personal access token as bot_token in backport.yml.
6. :cloud: Obfuscate the personal access token by xor it with a randomly generated bot_token_key. This step is only to prevent Github from automatically revoking your token by placing it in a public repository.
7. :speech_balloon: Let\'s say you want to backport a pull request on a branch named `production`. Then label it with `backport production`. (See [how to create labels](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-label/).)
8. :sparkles: That\'s it! When the pull request gets merged, another pull request will be opened, backporting the commit to the `production` branch. If the pull request cannot be backported, a comment explaining why will automatically be posted.

_Note:_ multiple backport labels can be added. For example, if a pull request has the labels `backport staging` and `backport production` it will be backported to both branches: `staging` and `production`.

## Security Implications

The token provided to backport.yml will be visible to anyone with access to your repo. If your repo
is public, this means everyone. This will allow anyone to impersonate
your bot account and use it to do anything your bot account can do. It is very important to give

GitHub Action to backport pull requests.

If you want that your CI runs on the new Pull request you should generate your own tocken in a secret
e.g. named `BACKPORT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Put this in your `.github/workflows/backport.yml`:

```yaml
```

And for each pull request that needs to be backported to branch `<branch>` add a `backport <branch>` label
on the pull request.

For cross project backport use `backport <repo> <branch>`.

You can also put it in the label description, in this case the label should start with `backport `,
and the description should follows this pattern: `(<desc> )?backport (<repo> )?<branch>`.

It\'s also useful to add in all jobs of your main continuous integration workflow:

```yaml
```

To don\'t run the CI on failed backport.

On failed backport a pull request is also open with the instructions to ends the backport as a comment.

# Changelog

v2.0.0

- Add support of cross project backport
- Add support of getting information from the label description

This Action approves and attempts to merge Pull Requests when triggered.

By using
[branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)
rules, it can be specified what the requirements are for a PR to be merged (e.g.
require branches to be up to date, require status checks to pass).

## Usage

The Action supports three run triggers:

- `check_suite` (works only on the default branch).
- `pull_request_target` for all branches.
- `workflow_run` for all branches.

When using the Merge Me! Action, ensure security of your workflows. GitHub
Security Lab provides more
[detailed](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
overview of these risks involved in using `pull_request_target` and
`workflow_run` triggers, as well as recommendations on how to avoid these risks.

Recommended setup differs between public and private repositories, however the
Action can be used in other combinations as well.

### Public repositories

Using a `workflow_run` trigger allows to provide the Merge Me! Action with
necessary credentials, while allowing the CI to keep using `pull_request`
trigger, which is safer than `pull_request_target`.

Create a new `.github/workflows/merge-me.yaml` file:

```yaml
```

Triggering on `check_suite` is similar:

```yaml
```

### Private repositories

Private repositories are less prone attacks, as only a restricted set of
accounts has access to them. At the same time, CIs in private repositories often
require access to secrets for other purposes as well, such as installing private
dependencies. For these reasons, it is recommended to use `pull_request_target`
trigger, which allows to combine regular CI checks and the Merge Me! Action into
one workflow:

```yaml
```

## Configuration

### Enable auto-merge for a different bot

You may have another bot that also creates PRs against your repository and you
want to automatically merge those. By default, this GitHub Action assumes the
bot is [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot). You can override the bot
name by changing the value of `GITHUB_LOGIN` parameter:

```yaml
```

A common scenario is to use Dependabot Preview (consider updating instead):

```yaml
```

`GITHUB_LOGIN` option supports
[micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).

### Opting in for using GitHub preview APIs

You may opt-in for using GitHub preview APIs, which enables the action to
respect strict branch protection rules configured for the repository
(`Require status checks to pass before merging` and
`Require branches to be up to date before merging` options).

```yaml
```

### Use of configurable pull request merge method

By default, this GitHub Action assumes merge method is `SQUASH`. You can
override the merge method by changing the value of `MERGE_METHOD` parameter (one
of `MERGE`, `SQUASH` or `REBASE`):

```yaml
```

### Presets

Presets enable additional functionality which can be used to better personalize
default behavior of the Merge me! Action.

Available presets are:

- `DEPENDABOT_MINOR` - Merge only minor and patch dependency updates for pull
  requests created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows
  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).
- `DEPENDABOT_PATCH` - Merge only patch dependency updates for pull requests
  created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows
  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).

```yaml
```

### Number of retries

In case the merge action fails, by default it will automatically be retried up
to three times using an exponential backoff strategy. This means, the first
retry will happen 1 second after the first failure, while the second will happen
4 seconds after the previous, the third 9 seconds, and so on.

It's possible to configure the number of retries by providing a value for
`MAXIMUM_RETRIES` (by default, the value is `3`).

```yaml
```

### Enable for manual changes

There are cases in which manual changes are needed, for instance, in order to
make the CI pass or to solve some conflicts that Dependabot (or the bot you are
using) cannot handle. By default, this GitHub action will skip this case where
the author is not [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot) (or the bot you
are using). This is often desirable as the author might prefer to get a code
review before merging the changes. For this, it checks whether all commits were
made by the original author and that the commit signature is valid.

It is possible to override this default behavior by setting the value of
`ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES` to `'true'`.

```yaml
```

> Important: Please note the single quotes around `true`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to
consume this package in your project.

### Prerequisites

Minimal requirements to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v14, installation instructions can be found
  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use
  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be
  installed in a
  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).
- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the
  documentation will follow the npm syntax.
- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.

### Installing

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
```

In case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by
using
[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action/archive/master.zip) and
extracting the downloaded archive.

Go the the right directory and install dependencies:

```bash
```

That's it! You can now go to the next step.

## Testing

All tests are being executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). All tests files
live side-to-side with a source code and have a common suffix: `.spec.ts`. Some
helper methods are being stored in the `test` directory.

There are three helper scripts to run tests in the most common scenarios:

```bash
```

## Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All
supported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one
of the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:

```bash
```

## Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.
TypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc). You can
use one of the following scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the
files:

```bash
```

## Publishing

Publishing is handled in an automated way and must not be performed manually.

Each commit to the master branch is automatically tagged using
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

### `leafo/gh-actions-luarocks`

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/leafo/gh-actions-luarocks/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/leafo/gh-actions-luarocks/actions)

Builds and installs LuaRocks from source into the `.luarocks/` directory in the working directory. Configures `PATH`, `LUA_PATH`, and `LUA_CPATH` environment variables to be able to use the `luarocks` command directly in workflows, and require installed modules in Lua.

[`leafo/gh-actions-lua`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-lua-luajit) can be used to install Lua, which is required for LuaRocks to build and run. (This action will use any Lua installed in `.lua/`).

## Usage

Installs Lua, LuaRocks, then install a module:

```yaml
```

For a more complete example see: https://github.com/leafo/gh-actions-lua/blob/master/README.md#full-example

## Inputs

### `luarocksVersion`

**Default**: `""3.8.0""`

Specifies which version of LuaRocks to install. Must be listed on https://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/

Example:

```yaml
```

### `withLuaPath`

**Default**: `null` (Optional)

Manually specify the path to an existing Lua installation to use. This is not
necessary if you are using `leafo/gh-actions-lua`. Will build LuaRocks with
`./configure --with-lua=$withLuaPath`

411,"# Release Asset Action

A GitHub action to add files to a release.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `file` | The file to upload | Optional |
| `files` | A new line seperated list of files upload | Optional |
| `pattern` | Glob pattern of files to upload | Optional |
| `github-token` | The GitHub token used to create an authenticated client | Required |
| `release-url` | The target url for the release file uploads | Optional |

### There are two ways you can use this action:

- Trigger on a release (does not work with drafts)
- Chain it after another action that creates an release

If this release is triggered on a ""release"" event, the url can automatically be
detected. However, if it is chained the `release-url` will need to be passed in
from the previous steps.

### Examples

Example on release event:

```
```

Example on tag event chained after another action:

 ```
 name: Build and relase

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - \'v*\'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Create Release
      id: create_release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body: Auto generated release
        draft: true
        prerelease: false
    - name: Build
      run: make
    - name: Upload Assets to Release with a wildcard
      uses: csexton/release-asset-action@v2
      with:
        pattern: ""build/*""
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        release-url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
 ```

### Selecting the right files with this action to upload

To upload a single file add a step like the following your workflow:

```
```


You can also set `files` or `pattern` if you need to upload multiple files.

New line seperated list of files:

```
```

Pattern to glob for files:

```
```

# Deprecation notice

Github Recently (19th of April) introduced a new feature ""concurrency"" which
adds the possibility of cancelling duplicate workflows in a much ""nicer"" way
than the ""cancel-workflow-action"":

[Announcement here](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-19-github-actions-limit-workflow-run-or-job-concurrency/)

It is MUCH easier to use and we are trying it out in Airflow - seems it
provides solution for most of the features of my action (one feature it does
not provide is workflow ""fail-fast"" in case of failure of some jobs (but this
was an edge case, likely not used by anyone except Apache Airflow as it require
quite some complex setup).

[Documenation of concurrency feature here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency)

The action is deprecated (and happily - it was just making up
lack of the feature in Github Actions).

# Context and motivation

Cancel Workflow Runs is an action that utilizes `workflow_run` triggers in order to perform various
run cancel operations. The idea is to save number of jobs and free them for other queued runs. It is
particularly useful in case your projects development flow where contributors submit pull requests
from forks. Using `workflow_run` trigger enables safe canceling of runs triggered by such pull requests.

In case your CI takes a lot of time and uses a lot of jobs, the action might help your project
to reduce job usage and decrease waiting time as it detects and cancels runs that are still executed,
but we know already they are superseded by newer runs.

The main purpose of this action is canceling duplicated runs for the same branch as the current run,
effectively limiting the resource consumption of the workflow to one run per branch. In short, the action
is useful if you want to limit jobs usage on GitHub Actions in case of the usage pattern
when fixups/rebases are pushed in quick succession to the same branch (fast iterations on a Pull Request).
This is achieved by `duplicates` cancel mode. The `duplicates` mode only cancels ""past"" runs - it does
not take into account runs that were started after the ""current"" run.

Another use case is to cancel the `pull_request` corresponding to the `workflow_run` triggered run.
This can happen when the triggered `workflow_run` finds that it makes no sense to proceed with
the source run. This is achieved by `self` cancel mode.

There are also two supplementary cancel modes for the action. Those supplementary use cases allow for further
optimisations - failing fast in case we detect that important job failed and canceling duplicates of the
`workflow_run` triggered events in case they execute some heavy jobs. This is achieved by `failedJobs` and
`namedJobs` cancel modes.

Note that `namedjobs` cancel mode is solely for the purpose of bypassing current limitations
of GitHub Actions. Currently, there is no way to retrieve connection between triggering and triggered
workflow in case of `workflow_run`, as well as retrieving repository and branch of the triggering
workflow. The action uses workaround - it requires designing workflows in the way that they pass necessary
information via carefully crafted job names. The job names are accessible via GitHub API, and they can be
resolved during execution of the workflow using information about the linked workflow available
at the workflow runtime. Hopefully this information will soon be available in GitHub Actions allowing
removal of `namedJobs` cancel mode and simplifying the examples and workflows using the Action.

Another feature of the Action is to notify the PRs linked to the workflows. Normally when workflows
get cancelled there is no information why it happens, but this action can add an explanatory comment
to the PR if the PR gets cancelled. This is controlled by `notifyPRCancel` boolean input.

Also, for the `workflow_run` events, GitHub does not yet provide an easy interface linking the original
Pull Request and the Workflow_run. You can ask the CancelWorkflowRun action to add extra comment to the PR
adding explanatory message followed by a link to the `workflow_run` run.

You can take a look at the description provided in the
[Apache Airflow\'s CI](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CI.rst) and
[the workflows](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/.github/workflows)

Started from simple cancel workflow developed by [n1hility](https://github.com/n1hility)
that implemented cancelling previous runs before introducing `workflow_run` type of event by
GitHub Actions: [Cancel](https://github.com/n1hility/cancel-previous-runs).

# Usage

If you want a comprehensive solution, you should use the action as follows:

1) In case your project does not use public forks, it\'s enough to have one action with the `duplicates`
   cancel mode in the workflow. This is a rare thing in open-source projects (usually those projects
   accept pull requests from forks) and more often applicable for private repositories.

2) If you use forks, you should create a separate ""Cancelling"" `workflow_run` triggered workflow.
   The `workflow_run` should be responsible for all canceling actions. The examples below show
   the possible ways the action can be utilized.

3) If you have ""high queue strain"" situation - i.e. you often have many workflows queued due to limits
   of teh GitHub Actions queue, you should consider using `allDuplicates` cancelling mode because otherwise,
   the cancel itself might get queued until it is already too late to cancel the job. The `allDuplicates`
   mode has been  designed to tackle this kind of situation where the ""canceling"" workflows are also queued,
   in which case the cancel actions are far more aggressive in cancelling the workflow runs - including
   the workflow runs that were started after the cancel action run. More about it in the
   [Tackling the high queue strain situation](#tackling-the-high-queue-strain-situation)

# The Action ""target"" workflow

The Action always acts on single ""target"" workflow. This means that it selects candidates to cancelling
(depending on the cabcelling mode) from all workflow runs that belong to a particular workflow.

This ""workflow"" to act on can be chosen in several ways:

1) By default, the action acts on workflow runs the action belongs to
2) When you want to enable canceling for Pull Requests from forks, the action should be run in a
   `workflow_run` type of event. In such case there are two workflows ""the source"" (for example pull_request) that
   was the original one and ""the target workflow"" triggered by the source one (this is the workflow that
   the cancel action should be part of). In such `workflow_run` type of event you should specify
   ""${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}"" as `sourceRunId` - then the action will act on the ""source""
   workflow instead of the default ""target"" one.
3) You can explicitly specify the `workflowFileName` parameter to make the action works on specified workflow.

Again - the action always acts on a single workflow, so if you want to specify a single job that should cancel
few different workflows, you need to copy that step as many times you need and set different
`workflowFileName` for every step. This is quite a bit repetitive, but this way you can see logs from
canceling operations from each workflow separately, and you can reason about it, at the same time having
multiple steps in the same jobs allows to optimize overhead of machine starting per job as those
actions are usually very quick.

| `notifyPRMessageStart`   | no       |              | Only for workflow_run events triggered by the PRs. If not empty, it notifies those PRs with the message specified at the start of the workflow - adding the link to the triggered workflow_run.                  |
| `jobNameRegexps`         | no       |              | An array of job name regexps. Only runs containing any job name matching any of of the regexp in this array are considered for cancelling in `failedJobs` and `namedJobs` and `allDuplicateNamedJobs` modes.     |
| `skipEventTypes`         | no       |              | Array of event names that should be skipped when cancelling (JSON-encoded string). This might be used in order to skip direct pushes or scheduled events.                                                        |
| `selfPreservation`       | no       | true         | Do not cancel self.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `workflowFileName`       | no       |              | Name of the workflow file. It can be used if you want to cancel a different workflow than yours.                                                                                                                 |


The job cancel modes work as follows:

## Most often used canceling example

The most common canceling example is that you want to cancel all duplicates appearing in your build queue.
As of 4.1 version of the Action this can be realised by single workflow run that can cancel all duplicates
for all running workflows. It is resistant to temporary queues - as it can cancel also the future, queued
workflows that have duplicated, fresher (also queued workflows and this is recommended for everyone.

The below example is a ""workflow_run"" type of event. The workflow_run event always has ""write"" access that allows
it to cancel other workflows - even if they are coming from pull request.

```yaml
```


# More Examples

Note that you can combine the steps below in several steps of the same job. The examples here are showing
one step per case for clarity.

## Repositories that use Pull Requests from forks

Note that in case you implement separate ""Canceling workflow"", following the examples below, you do not
need to add cancel action to any other workflow. All Cancel actions should be configured in this
Cancelling workflow.

Those examples show how you should configure your project with separate `Cancelling` workflow which is
triggered via `workflow_run` trigger.

In the example belows we use the following names:

* **triggered workflow** - the ""Cancelling"" workflow - separate workflow triggered by the `workflow_run`
  event. Its main job is to manage cancelling of other workflows.

* **triggered run** - the run of the *triggered workflow*. It is triggered by another (""source"") run. In the
  examples below, this run is in ""Cancelling"" workflow. It always runs in the context of the main repository,
  even if it is triggered by a Pull Request from a fork.

* **source workflow** - the ""main"" workflow - main workflow that performs CI actions. In the examples below,
  this is a ""CI"" workflow.

* **source run** - the run of the *source workflow*. It is the run that triggers the *triggered run*,
  and it runs most of the CI tasks. In the examples below those are the runs of ""CI"" workflow.

### Cancel duplicate runs for the source workflow

Cancel past, duplicate *source runs* of the *source workflow*. This workflow cancels
duplicated, past runs (for the same branch/repo that those associated with the *source run* that triggered
the *triggered run*). You have to create it with the `sourceRunId` input with the value of
`${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}` in order to work correctly.

In the example below, the `Canceling` run cancels past, duplicate runs from the `CI` with the same
branch/repo as the *source run* which triggered it - effectively what\'s left after the action is only
the latest *source run* of ""CI"" from the same branch/repo.

This works for all kind of triggering events (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` ...). It works for
events triggered in the local repository, as well as triggered from the forks, so you do not need
to set up any extra actions to cancel internal Pushes/Pull Requests.

You can also choose to skip certain types of events (for example `push` and `schedule` if you want your
jobs to run to full completion for this kind of events.

```yaml
```

Note that `duplicate` cancel mode cannot be used for `workflow_run` type of event without `sourceId` input.
The action will throw an error in this case because it is not really doing what you would expect it to do.
All `workflow_run` events have the same branch and repository (they are all run in the context of the
target branch and repository) no matter what is the source of the event, therefore cancelling duplicates
would cancel all the runs originated from all the branches and this is not really expected.

If you want to cancel duplicate runs of the *triggered workflow*, you need to utilize the
`namedJob` cancel mode as described in the next chapter
[Cancel duplicate jobs for triggered workflow](#cancel-duplicate-jobs-for-triggered-workflow) using outputs
from the duplicate canceling for *source workflow* run above.

Hopefully we will have an easier way of doing that in the future once GitHub Actions API will allow
searching for source runs (it\'s not available at this moment).

### Cancel duplicate jobs for triggered workflow

Cancels all past runs from the *triggered workflow* if any of the job names match any of the regular
expressions. Note that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all runs
with matching job names no mater the branch/repo.

This example is much more complex. It shows the actual case on how you can design your jobs using with
using outputs from the cancel duplicate action and running subsequent cancel with namedJobs cancel
mode. Hopefully in the future better solution will come from Github Actions and such cancel flow will
be natively supported by GitHub Actions but as of now (August 2020) such native support is not
possible. The example below uses specially named jobs that contain Branch, Repo and Run id of
the triggering run. The cancel operation finds the runs that have jobs with the names following
pattern containing the same repo and branch as the source run branch and repo in order to cancel duplicates.

In the case below, this workflow will first cancel the ""CI"" duplicate runs from the same branch and then
it will cancel the runs from the Cancelling workflow which contain the same repo and branch as
in job names, effectively implementing cancelling duplicate runs for the Cancelling workflow.


```yaml
```


### Cancel the ""self"" source workflow run

This is useful in case you decide to cancel the *source run* that triggered the *triggered run*.
In the case below, the step cancels the `CI` workflow that triggered the `Cancelling` run.

```yaml
```


### Cancel the ""self"" triggered workflow run

This is useful in case you decide to cancel the *triggered run*. The difference vs. previous case is that
you do not specify the `sourceRunId` input.

In the case below - self workflow will be cancelled.

```yaml
```

Note that if you want to cancel both - source workflow and self workflow you need to first cancel
the source workflow, and then cancel the self one, not the other way round :).

### Fail-fast source workflow runs with failed jobs

Cancels all runs from the *source workflow* if there are failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions.
Note that the action does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs
with failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.

In the case below, if any of `CI` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs
names matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they
will be cancelled.

```yaml
```

Note that if you not only want to cancel the failed triggering workflows but also
the want to fail the corresponding ""Cancelling"" workflows, you need to implement the solution
described in the next chapter.

### Fail-fast source workflow runs with failed jobs and corresponding triggered runs

Cancels all runs from the *source workflow* if there are failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions,
also cancels the corresponding *triggered runs*.
Note that the action does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs
with failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.

In the case below, if any of `CI` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs
names matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they
will be cancelled as well as the corresponding ""Cancelling"" workflow runs.

There is no native support yet in GitHub actions to do it easily, so the example below shows how this can be
achieved using `namedJobs` and output returned from the previous `Cancel Workflow Runs` action. Hopefull
this will be simplified when GitHub Actions introduce native support for it.

```yaml
```

Note that if you not only want to cancel the failed triggering workflows but also
the want to fail the corresponding ""Cancelling"" workflows, you need to implement the solution
described in the next chapter.

### Fail-fast for triggered workflow runs with failed jobs

Cancels all runs from the *triggered workflow* if there are failed jobs matching any of the regular
expressions. Note that it does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs
with failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.

In the case below, if any of `Cancelling` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs
names matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they
will be cancelled.

```yaml
```

### Cancel another workflow run

This is useful in case you decide to cancel the *source run* that triggered the *triggered run*.
In the case below, the step cancels the `CI` workflow that triggered the `Cancelling` run.

```yaml
```

### Cancel all duplicates for named jobs

Cancels all duplicated runs for all jobs that match specified regular expression.
Note that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all duplicates with
the same match for jobs, no matter what branch originated it.

This is useful in case of job names generated dynamically.

In the case below, for all the runs that have job names generated containing Branch/Repo/Event combination
that have the same match, the duplicates will get cancelled leaving only the most recent run for each exact
match.

Note that the match must be identical. If there are two jobs that have a different Branch
they will both match the same pattern, but they are not considered duplicates.

Also, this is one of the jobs It has also self-preservation turned off.
This means that in case the job determines that it is itself a duplicate it will cancel itself. That\'s
why checking for duplicates of self-workflow should be the last step in the cancelling process.


```yaml
```



## Repositories that do not use Pull Requests from forks

Note that examples in this chapter only work if you do not have Pull Requests coming from forks (so for
example if you only work in a private repository). When those action runs within the usual `pull_request`
triggered runs coming from a fork, they have not enough permissions to cancel running workflows.

If you want to cancel `pull_requests` from forks, you need to use `workflow_run` triggered runs - see the
[Repositories that use Pull Requests from fork](#repositories-that-use-pull-requests-from-forks) chapter.

Note that in case you configure the separate `workflow_run` Cancelling workflow, there is no need to add
the action to the ""source"" workflows. The ""Canceling workflow"" pattern handles well not only Pull Requests
from the forks, but also all other cases - including cancelling Pull Requests for the same repository
and canceling scheduled runs.

### Cancel duplicate runs for ""self"" workflow

Cancels past runs for the same workflow (with the same branch).

In the case below, any of the direct ""push"" events will cancel all past runs for the same branch as the
one being pushed. However, it can be configured for ""pull_request"" (in the same repository) or ""schedule""
type of events as well. It will also notify the PR with the comment containining why it has been
cancelled.

```yaml
```

### Cancel ""self"" workflow run

This is useful in case you decide to cancel ""self"" run.

In the case below - own workflow will be cancelled immediately. It can be configured for ""push"",
""pull_request"" (from the same repository) or ""schedule"" type of events.

```yaml
```

### Fail-fast workflow runs with failed jobs

Cancels all runs (including self run!) if they have failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions.
Note that it does not take into account the branch of the running jobs. It will cancel all runs with failed
jobs, no matter what branch originated it.

In the case below, if any of the own workflow runs have failed jobs matching any of the
`^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp, this workflow will cancel the runs.

```yaml
```

### Cancel all runs with named jobs

Cancels all runs (including self run!) if any of the job names match any of the regular
expressions. Note that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all runs with
matching jobs, no matter what branch originated it.

This is useful in case of job names generated dynamically.

In the case below, if any of the ""self"" workflow runs has job names that matches any of the
`^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp, this workflow will cancel the runs.

```yaml
```

## Tackling the high queue strain situation

Sometimes your project is in a situation where you have high strain on the queue in GitHub Actions.
All GitHub Actions queues are limited and when you have many, long-running workflows triggered by
many PRs, you can get in the situation, where the ""cancel"" workflows are queued themselves. This is where
`allDuplicates` mode of cancellation becomes handy,


Imagine, You have a number of people submitting `PR1`, `PR2` from their forks, and a committer pushing branch
`branch-A` directly to your repository.  Imagine that some of those people pushed several commits in
quick succession  for all of those.

This usually happen when you realized that there is one more change needed or when you
iteratively work on your PR. Usually it is either a `--force-push` commit replacing the previous ones
or ""--fixup commit"". It works the same in both cases but this is a ""natural"" way people work.
For example for many people it is far easier to review whole extent of your change in GitHub
(they are used to doing PR reviews there). They push the change as PR, review it there themselves
and realize they need one more line to be removed (and they add --fixup and push again).

Coming back to my example. Imagine you have high strain situation. All your PRs generated 10 or so
workflows (that\'s how Pulsar works - produces many workflows per PR). But let\'s assume we have two
""real"" workflows ""w1"" and ""w2"" and the ""cancel"" workflow I added ""c"". So, initially all of the workflows
generated are in ""Pending"" state. assume each of the PRs has been pushed twice -
first `Commit 1` (C1) and then fixup `Commit 2` (C2). So all C1s are ""older"" duplicates of C2 that
should be cancelled as soon as possible (we know newer version is coming).

|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |

Then imagine that PR1 ""standard"" worflows started to run for C1. So they change state to \'running\'

|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | running | running | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |

So far so good. Then the ""cancel workflow""  starts running for C1 commit in PR1.

|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | running | running | running | pending | pending | pending |
| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |

The ""cancel"" workflow with `allDuplicates` mode is ""aggressive"". It will look for ANY duplicates in
ANY PRs/Branches (including the Pending ones) and cancels them. So what happens next it will set all
C1 runs to cancelled state (no matter if they were Pending or running):


|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | cancelling | cancelling | complete | pending | pending | pending |
| PR2      | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |
| branch-A | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |

Those runs will be quickly canceled and job slots from the ""Running"" ones will be freed for next runs so
likely, some of the Pending C2 runs from PR1 will be quickly ""Running:

|          | c-C1     | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | complete | running | running | pending |
| PR2      | pending  | pending | pending | pending |
| branch-A | pending  | pending | pending | pending |

Now - the ""cancel"" workflows are not cancelled themselves. They will continue running, but they are
quick usually and any ""cancel workflow"" run next will see there are no duplicates and will complete
quickly leaving the ""slot"" for ""real"" workflows of the latest commits (C2) to run - hopefully more
slots are available then, and your C2 workflows start running after that:

|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |
| PR2      | complete | running  | running  | pending  |
| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  |

Hower if the committer again pushes THIRD commit C3 to branch-A in the meantime, the (so far pending)
cancel workflows will again prove to be useful. Let\'s say PR2\'s ""cancel workflow"" for C2 runs after
the new commit has been added by the commiyter:

|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |
| PR2      | complete | complete | running  | running  |         |         |         |
| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending | pending | pending |

The PR2\'s c-C2 workflow (or even branch-As, c-C1 workflow if the PR2\'s one managed to run already)
will find that there is a duplicate in `branch-A` and it will cancel those:

|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |
| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |
| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | running  | running | running | pending |

Again the remaining ""cancel"" workflow (branch A\'s c-C2 an c-C3) complete quickly and do nothing as
there are no duplicates, freeing the slot for ""regular"" workflows:

|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |
| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |
| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | complete  | running | running | complete |

Effectively what we get is that the ""duplicates"" will be cancelled frequently enough (as often as
ANY ""cancel"" workflow from  ANY commit from ANY branch manages to get into ""running"" state)


## Development environment

It is highly recommended tu use [pre commit](https://pre-commit.com). The pre-commits
installed via pre-commit tool handle automatically linting (including automated fixes) as well
as building and packaging Javascript index.js from the main.ts Typescript code, so you do not have
to run it yourself.

413,"## Cancel Action
This Action uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/workflow_runs/#cancel-a-workflow-run) to cancel the currently running workflow. Example usage:

```yaml
```

The cancellation might take a few seconds to process, this is most useful when you'd like to cancel a long running build. In combination with the `if` statement, this allows you to cancel the build conditionally.

The following arguments can be configured on the job using the `with` keyword
(see example above). Currently, possible inputs are all the flags for
`kind cluster create`, with the additional version, which sets the Kind version
to download and `skipClusterCreation`, which when present, skips creating the
cluster (the Kind tools is configured in the path).

Optional inputs:

- `version`: version of Kind to use (default `""v0.11.1""`)
- `config`: path (relative to the root of the repository) to a kind config file.
  If omitted, a default 1-node cluster will be created
- `image`: node Docker image to use for booting the cluster.
- `name`: cluster name (default `""kind""`)
- `wait`: wait for control plane node to be ready (default `""300s""`)
- `kubeconfig`: sets kubeconfig path instead of $KUBECONFIG or $HOME/.kube/config
- `skipClusterCreation`: if `""true""`, the action will not create a cluster, just
  acquire the tools
- `skipClusterDeletion`: if `""true""`, the action will not delete the cluster
- `skipClusterLogsExport`: if `""true""`, the action will not export the cluster logs
- `verbosity`: numeric log verbosity, (info = 0, debug = 3, trace = 2147483647) (default `""0""`)
- `quiet`: silence all stderr output (default `""false""`)

Example using optional inputs:

```yaml
```

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-6-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)
<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:END --> 

A GitHub Action for syncing the current repository using **force push**.


## Features
 * Sync branches between two GitHub repositories
 * Sync branches from a remote repository
 * GitHub action can be triggered on a timer or on push
 * To push to a remote repository, please checkout [git-sync](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-sync-action)
 * Support syncing tags.


## Usage

Create a personal access token and add to repository\'s secret as `PAT`

### GitHub Actions
```
```
If `source_repo` is private or with another provider, either (1) use an authenticated HTTPS repo clone url like `https://${access_token}@github.com/owner/repository.git` or (2) set a `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret environment variable and use the SSH clone url

### Workflow overwriting

If `destination_branch` and the branch where you will create this workflow will be the same, The workflow (and all files) will be overwritten by `source_branch` files. A potential solution is: Create a new branch with the actions file and make it the default branch.

## Advanced Usage: Sync all branches
1. Make a backup
2. Create a new branch in your repo (destination repo), it should not share the name with any branch in source repo
3. Make the new branch the default branch under repo settings
4. Use `*` for both `source_branch` and `destination_branch`
5. Optionally, you can force sync all tags:
   ```
   with:
     sync_tags: ""true""
   ```
This will force sync ALL branches to match source repo. Branches that are created only in the destination repo will not be affected but all the other branches will be *hard reset* to match source repo. \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This does mean if upstream ever creates a branch that shares the name, your changes will be gone.

# clang-format-action
GitHub Action for `clang-format` checks. Note that this Action does **NOT** format your code for you - it only verifies that your repository\'s code follows your project\'s formatting conventions.

You can define your own formatting rules in a `.clang-format` file at your repository root, or you can provide a fallback style (see [`fallback-style`](#inputs)). You can also provide a path to check. If you want to run checks against multiple paths in your repository, you can use this Action in a [matrix run](#multiple-paths).

## Major versions supported
* 3: `clang-format-3.9`
* 4: `clang-format-4.0`
* 5: `clang-format-5.0`
* 6: `clang-format-6.0`
* 7: `clang-format-7`
* 8: `clang-format-8`
* 9: `clang-format-9`
* 10: `clang-format-10`
* 11:  `clang-format-11`
* 12: `clang-format-12`
* 13: `clang-format-13`
* 14: `clang-format-14`
* 15: `clang-format-15`
* 16: `clang-format-16`

## Do you find this useful?

You can sponsor me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/jidicula)!

## Inputs
* `clang-format-version` [optional]: The major version of `clang-format` that you want to run on your codebase.
  * Default: `13`
  * Available versions: see [Versions supported](#versions-supported)
* `check-path` [optional]: The path to the directory in the repo that should be checked for C/C++/Protobuf formatting.
  * Default: `.`
  * For cleaner output (i.e. with no double-slashed paths), the final directory in this path should have no trailing slash, e.g. `src` and not `src/`.
* `fallback-style` [optional]: The fallback style for `clang-format` if no `.clang-format` file exists in your repository.
  * Default: `llvm`
  * Available values: `LLVM`, `Google`, `Chromium`, `Mozilla`, `WebKit` and others listed in the `clang-format` [docs for BasedOnStyle](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html#configurable-format-style-options).
* `exclude-regex` [optional]: A regex to exclude files or directories that should not be checked.
  * Default: `^$`
  * Pattern matching is done with a POSIX `grep -E` extended regex, **not** a glob expression. You can exclude multiple patterns like this: `(hello|world)`. Build and verify your regex at https://regex101.com .
* `include-regex` [optional]: A regex to include files or directories that should be checked.
  * Default: `^.*\\.((((c|C)(c|pp|xx|\\+\\+)?$)|((h|H)h?(pp|xx|\\+\\+)?$))|(ino|pde|proto|cu))$`
  * Pattern matching is done with a POSIX `grep -E` extended regex, **not** a glob expression. You can exclude multiple patterns like this: `(hello|world)`. Build and verify your regex at https://regex101.com .

This action checks all C/C++/Protobuf (including Arduino `.ino` and `.pde`) files in the provided directory in the GitHub workspace are formatted correctly using `clang-format`. If no directory is provided or the provided path is not a directory in the GitHub workspace, all C/C++/Protobuf files are checked.

The following file extensions are checked by default:
* Header files:
  * `.h`
  * `.H`
  * `.hpp`
  * `.hh`
  * `.h++`
  * `.hxx `
* Source files:
  * `.c`
  * `.C`
  * `.cpp`
  * `.cc`
  * `.c++`
  * `.cxx`
  * `.ino`
  * `.pde`
  * `.cu`
* Protobuf files:
  * `.proto`

## Returns:

* SUCCESS: zero exit-code if C/C++/Protobuf files in `check-path` are formatted correctly
* FAILURE: nonzero exit-code if C/C++/Protobuf files in `check-path` are not formatted correctly

Modern Tribe\'s PHPCS Code Review - GitHub Action

## Dockerfile

The container in use is currently on Docker Hub as `borkweb/tribe-phpcs`. The Dockerfile for that image is defined in our [packages repo](https://github.com/moderntribe/packages).

## Usage

If you would like to add automated code sniffing to PRs on a new repository, there are a few things that must be set up first.

### Add PHPCS to `composer.json`

For PHPCS to function appropriately, it needs to be included in the repository via composer.

**Within `require-dev`, add the following:**

```
```

**Within `repositories`, add the following:**

```
```

### Create `phpcs.xml`

You\'ll need a `phpcs.xml` file to declare the rulesets the repository will be using. Here\'s an example of one that we use for our plugins:

```xml
```

### Adding a GitHub Workflow

You will need a GitHub Workflow to make this magic happen. You can [read about it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow) in the GitHub docs. You could also just copy the `.github/workflows` directory from [The Events Calendar](https://github.com/moderntribe/the-events-calendar).

#### Inputs

##### `github-bot-token`

You will need to declare a secret of `GH_BOT_TOKEN` in your repo\'s Settings > Secrets. The token should be a Personal Access Token (preferably for a bot account) where that bot has access to the relevant repos in the Modern Tribe organization. The Token for tr1b0t is labeled as `tr1b0t GitHub OAuth Token` in our company 1Password vault.

## Action event details
### Target events
| eventName | action |
|:---|:---|
| pull_request | opened, reopened, synchronize, closed, ready_for_review |
| push | * |

If called on any other event, the result will be empty.

## Addition
### FROM, TO
| condition | FROM | TO |
|:---|:---|:---|
| tag push | --- | --- |
| pull request | pull.base.ref (e.g. main) | context.ref (e.g. refs/pull/123/merge) |
| push (which has related pull request) | pull.base.ref (e.g. main) | `refs/pull/${pull.number}/merge` (e.g. refs/pull/123/merge) |
| context.payload.before = \'000...000\' | default branch (e.g. main) | context.payload.after |
| else | context.payload.before | context.payload.after |

### Check only the latest commit differences in a draft Pull Request
```yaml
```

### To get the result in Json format
```yaml
```

Result:
```shell
```

### Specify a relative path

GitHub Actions doesn\'t support `working-directory` for `uses`, so you can\'t run this action separately for monorepo configuration, etc. However, if you specify the `RELATIVE` option, it will be used as `--relative=<RELATIVE>` for `git diff`.

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---relativeltpathgt

```yaml
```

If the files `src/abc/test1.ts`, `src/abc/test2.ts`, `src/abc/test3.txt`, and `src/test4.ts` exist, the result will be as follows:

```shell
```

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

Referencing the major version is
([recommended by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-versioning.md)).

```yml
```

> **Note**: Whenever you use a custom docker-based GitHub Action like this one, you may notice in
> your run logs, one of the first steps you\'ll see will be GA building the image for you. You can
> speed up runs by pulling pre-built docker images instead of making GitHub Actions build them on
> every run.

```yml
```

**If you\'re security conscious**, you can
[pin the docker image down to a specific digest](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2020/the-security-of-github-actions#docker-based-actions)
instead of using an image tag, which is a mutable reference.

```yml
```

Where `<digest>` is any
[docker image digest you want here](https://github.com/users/codfish/packages/container/package/semantic-release-action).

### Basic Usage

> **Note**: Until
> [this semantic-release pr](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/pull/1737) gets
> merged, `main` is not a supported branch by default. If your repository is using `main` as the
> default branch which is extremely common, you need to pass the branches input into the action, or
> define it in your semantic-release config explicitly. See:
> https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/pull/1737

```yml
```

**Using output variables set by `semantic-release-action`:**

```yml
```

**Example:** Only run an action if a new version was created.

```yml
```

**Using environment variables set by `semantic-release-action`:**

```yml
```

If you\'re _not_ publishing to npm and only want to use this action for GitHub releases, the easiest
approach would simply be to add `""private"": true,` to your `package.json`.

## Why

It\'s fairly easy to run `semantic-release` as a ""host action,"" aka something that runs directly on
the VM.

```yml
```

If you\'re just publishing a node package, then this could still work well for you. The problem I
found with this is when I was in projects where I had subsequent steps/actions in which I wanted to
know whether a new version was cut.

> **Use Case:** For instance, in an application where I\'m using `semantic-release` to manage GitHub
> releases, but also building and pushing docker images. Dockerhub has a
> [nice GitHub integration](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) to handle this for us, but
> some other registries do not. If I need to cut a new release, then update a docker registry by
> adding a new tagged build, I\'ll want to run `semantic-release` and then build a docker image, tag
> it with a version and push it up. In my case I like to push up tags for `latest`, the semver (i.e.
> `v1.8.3`), and just the major the version (i.e. `v1`).

I want to know 1) if semantic-release cut a new version and 2) what the version is.

There\'s a number of ways to handle this, but the most elegant way I found to do it was to abstract
it into it\'s own custom action. It abstracts away whatever logic you need to figure out what that
new release number is.

This also scales well, just in case I want to add some flexibility and functionality to this action,
I can easily leverage it across any project.

## Configuration

You can pass in `semantic-release` configuration options via GitHub Action inputs using `with`.

It\'s important to note, **NONE** of these inputs are required. Semantic release has a default
configuration that it will use if you don\'t provide any.

Also of note, if you\'d like to override the default configuration and you\'d rather not use the
inputs here, the action will automatically use any
[`semantic-release` configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration-file)
defined in your repo (`.releaserc`, `release.config.js`, `release` prop in `package.json`)

> **Note**: Each input **will take precedence** over options configured in the configuration file
> and shareable configurations.

### Example with all inputs

```yml
```

### Outputs

`semantic-release-action` sets both output variables and environment variables because why not?
Allows users the ability to use whichever they want. I don\'t know or understand every use case there
might be so this is a way to cover more cases.

> **NOTE**: The `marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases` repository is an automatically generated mirror of the [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions) monorepo containing this and other actions. Please file issues and pull requests over there.

## Usage Examples

### Automatically generate a pre-release when changes land on master

This example workflow will kick in as soon as changes land on `master`. After running the steps to build and test your project:

1. It will create (or replace) a git tag called `latest`.
1. Generate a changelog from all the commits between this, and the previous `latest` tag.
1. Generate a new release associated with the `latest` tag (removing any previous associated releases).
1. Update this new release with the specified title (e.g. `Development Build`).
1. Upload `LICENSE.txt` and any `jar` files as release assets.
1. Mark this release as a `pre-release`.

You can see a working example of this workflow over at [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/releases/tag/latest).

```yaml
```

### Create a new GitHub release when tags are pushed to the repository

Similar to the previous example, this workflow will kick in as soon as new tags are pushed to GitHub. After building & testing your project:

1. Generate a changelog from all the commits between this and the previous [semver-looking](https://semver.org/) tag.
1. Generate a new release and associate it with this tag.
1. Upload `LICENSE.txt` and any `jar` files as release assets.

Once again there\'s an example of this over at [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/releases/latest).

```yaml
```

## Supported Parameters

| Parameter               | Description                                                | Default  |

## Outputs

The following output values can be accessed via `${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.<output-name> }}`:

| Name                     | Description                                            | Type   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| `automatic_releases_tag` | The release tag this action just processed             | string |
| `upload_url`             | The URL for uploading additional assets to the release | string |

### Notes:

- Parameters denoted with `**` are required.
- The `files` parameter supports multi-line [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) patterns, see repository examples.

## Event Triggers

The GitHub Actions framework allows you to trigger this (and other) actions on _many combinations_ of events. For example, you could create specific pre-releases for release candidate tags (e.g `*-rc*`), generate releases as changes land on master (example above), nightly releases, and much more. Read through [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for ideas and advanced examples.

## Versioning

Every commit that lands on master for this project triggers an automatic build as well as a tagged release called `latest`. If you don\'t wish to live on the bleeding edge you may use a stable release instead. See [releases](../../releases/latest) for the available versions.

```yaml
```

## How to get help

The main [README](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/blob/master/README.md) for this project has a bunch of information related to debugging & submitting issues. If you\'re still stuck, try and get a hold of me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/marvinpinto) and I will do my best to help you out.

430,"# [github-action-git-bash](https://github.com/fnkr/github-action-git-bash)

GitHub Action to run a command or script in a Git-ready environment.
Possible use cases include push mirroring, committing and pushing changes,
merging branches, or creating tags from a CI pipeline.

## Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` \xe2\x80\x94 **Optional.** If set, the action will set Git\'s `user.name` and `user.email` options to the actors name and email. This is useful when creating commits.
- `SSH_KEY` \xe2\x80\x94 **Optional.** If set, the action will start an SSH agent and insert the key. This is useful for authenticating with remote repositories (e.g. for push mirroring). The secret must contain an unencrypted private key without trailing line feed.

## Variables

- `SSH_KEY_VAR` \xe2\x80\x94 **Optional.** Name of the `SSH_KEY` secret. This can be useful if the action is used multiple times in a workflow.

# Trufflehog Actions Scan :pig_nose::key:

Scan recent commits in repository for secrets with basic [trufflehog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) defaults in place for easy setup.

This action is intended as a Continuous Integration secret scan in an already ""clean"" repository. The default commit scan depth is the last 50 commits and can be adjusted using Custom Arguments (see below).

It is recommended to run a basic trufflehog scan on your entire repository prior to relying on this CI solution (Note: this can be done manually from the command line or by using this action with custom options `""--regex --entropy=False""`).

## Usage

```txt
```

Default trufflehog options for this tool include:

- regex : Enable high signal regex checks

- entropy disabled: Disabled entropy checks

- max depth is 50: The max commit depth to go back when searching for secrets

Edit your corresponding actions `yml` file or create a new one.

### Basic

```yaml
```

### Custom Arguments

```yaml
  with:
    scanArguments: ""--regex --entropy=False --max_depth=5"" # Add custom options here*

```

*if custom options argument string is used, it will overwrite default settings

### Private GitHub Repository

Pass a GitHub access token to action to clone from a private GitHub repository.
You can\'t use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` as it doesn\'t have the permission to clone the repository.

```yaml
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_CLONE_TOKEN }} # You have to create an access token manually

```

435,"# circleci-artifacts-redirector-action

GitHub Action to add a GitHub status link to a CircleCI artifact.

## Example usage

Sample `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

```YAML
```
- The `if: ""${{ github.event.context == \'ci/circleci: build_doc\' }}""`
  conditional in the `job` is helpful to limit the number of redirector
  actions that your repo will run to avoid polluting your GitHub actions
  logs. The `circleci-jobs` (below) should be labeled correspondingly.
- The `api-token` needs to be a
  *[CircleCI personal API token](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens)*
  (not a *project token* as it is not supported yet in API v2!) whose value
  has been added to the GitHub secrets of your repository (e.g., as 
  `CIRCLE_TOKEN`), e.g. for the MNE-Python *project* this would be
  https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/settings/secrets/actions and for the
  *organization* it would be https://github.com/organizations/mne-tools/settings/secrets/actions (pick whichever scope makes sense for you).
- The `artifact-path` should point to an artifact path from your CircleCI
  build. This is typically whatever follows the CircleCI artifact root path,
  for example `0/test_artifacts/root_artifact.md`.
- The `circleci-jobs` is a comma-separated list of jobs to monitor, but usually
  there is a single one that you want an artifact path for.
  The default is `""build_docs,build,doc""`, which will look for any
  jobs with these names and create an artifacts link for them. If you have
  multiple jobs to consider, make sure you adjust your `if:` statement (above)
  correspondingly.
- The `job-title` corresponds to the name of the action job as it will appear
  on github. It is **not** the circle-ci job you want the artifacts for
  (this is `circleci-jobs`). This field is optional.
- The action has an outtput ``url`` that you can use in downstream steps, but
  this URL will only point to a valid artifact once the job is complete, i.e.,
  `github.event.status` is either `\'success\'`, `\'fail\'`, or (maybe) `\'error\'`,
  not `\'pending\'`.
- If you have trouble, try [enabling debugging logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)
  for the action by setting the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true`.

> **Note**: The standard PR-to-main-repo-from-branch-in-a-fork workflow might
> not activate the action. For changes to take effect, changes might need to be
> made to to the default branch *in a repo with the action enabled*. For
> example, you could iterate directly in `master`, or in `master` of a fork.
> This seems to be a limitation of the fact that CircleCI uses the `status`
> (rather than app) API and that this is always tied to the `master`/default
> branch of a given repository.

## Limitations

Currently has (known) limitations:

- Tests do not test anything (haven\'t gotten around to fixing them)
- Only allows redirecting to a single file that must be configured ahead of
  time as a file (cannot be changed within the CircleCI run)

Eventually this might be fixable by a bit of work and addition of
customization options.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Deploys AWS CloudFormation Stacks.

## Usage

```yaml
```

The action can be passed a CloudFormation Stack `name` and a `template` file. The `template` file can be a local file existing in the working directory, or a URL to template that exists in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket. It will create the Stack if it does not exist, or create a [Change Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html) to update the Stack. An update fails by default when the Change Set is empty. Setting `no-fail-on-empty-changeset: ""1""` will override this behavior and not throw an error.

### Inputs

A few inputs are highlighted below. See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs and outputs.

#### parameter-overrides (OPTIONAL)

To override parameter values in the template you can provide a string or a file that is either local or an URL.

Override multiple parameters separated by commas: `""MyParam1=myValue1,MyParam2=myValue2""`

Override a comma delimited list: `""MyParam1=myValue1,MyParam1=myValue2""` or `MyParam1=""myValue1,myValue2""`

Override parameters using a local JSON file: `""file:///${{ github.workspace }}/parameters.json""` with a file named `parameters.json` at the root of the repository:
```json
```

> You can learn more about [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

## Credentials and Region

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.
Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:

- Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code. You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.
- [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository. Do not use the AWS account root user access key.
- [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows. Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows. See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
- [Rotate the credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) used in GitHub Actions workflows regularly.
- [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Permissions

This action requires the following minimum set of permissions:

> We recommend to read [AWS CloudFormation Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)

```
```

> The policy above prevents the stack to be deleted by a policy for production

## Example

You want to run your microservices with [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and leverage the best-practices to run the cluster? Using this GitHub Action you can customize and deploy the [modular and scalable Amazon EKS architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/) provided in an AWS Quick Start to your AWS Account. The following workflow enables you to create and update a Kubernetes cluster using a manual workflow trigger.

You only have to create an [Amazon EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) to run this workflow.

```yaml
```

### Proxy Configuration

If you run in self-hosted environments and in secured environment where you need use a specific proxy you can set it in the action manually.

Additionally this action will always consider already configured proxy in the environment.

Manually configured proxy:
```yaml
```

Proxy configured in the environment variable:

```bash
```

The action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment and you don\'t need to configure it in the action.

[![Setup Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform/actions/workflows/setup-terraform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform/actions/workflows/setup-terraform.yml)

The `hashicorp/setup-terraform` action is a JavaScript action that sets up Terraform CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow by:

- Downloading a specific version of Terraform CLI and adding it to the `PATH`.
- Configuring the [Terraform CLI configuration file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/cli-config.html) with a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise hostname and API token.
- Installing a wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls of the `terraform` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively. (This can be optionally skipped if subsequent steps in the same job do not need to access the results of Terraform commands.)

After you\'ve used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Terraform commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun). This allows most Terraform commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.

## Usage

This action can be run on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners. When running on `windows-latest` the shell should be set to Bash.

The default configuration installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and installs the wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls to the `terraform` binary:

```yaml
```

A specific version of Terraform CLI can be installed:

```yaml
  with:
    terraform_version: 1.1.7
```

Credentials for Terraform Cloud ([app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/)) can be configured:

```yaml
  with:
    cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}
```

Credentials for Terraform Enterprise (TFE) can be configured:

```yaml
  with:
    cli_config_credentials_hostname: \'terraform.example.com\'
    cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}
```

The wrapper script installation can be skipped by setting the `terraform_wrapper` variable to `false`:

```yaml
  with:
    terraform_wrapper: false
```

Subsequent steps can access outputs when the wrapper script is installed:

```yaml

- run: terraform init

- id: plan
  run: terraform plan -no-color

- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}
- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stderr }}
- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.exitcode }}
```

Outputs can be used in subsequent steps to comment on the pull request:

> **Notice:** There\'s a limit to the number of characters inside a GitHub comment (65535).
>

```yaml
```

Instead of creating a new comment each time, you can also update an existing one:

```yaml
```

## Inputs

The action supports the following inputs:

- `cli_config_credentials_hostname` - (optional) The hostname of a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise instance to
   place within the credentials block of the Terraform CLI configuration file. Defaults to `app.terraform.io`.
- `cli_config_credentials_token` - (optional) The API token for a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise instance to
   place within the credentials block of the Terraform CLI configuration file.
- `terraform_version` - (optional) The version of Terraform CLI to install. Instead of a full version string,
   you can also specify a constraint string (see [Semver Ranges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#ranges)
   for available range specifications). Examples are: `<1.2.0`, `~1.1.0`, `1.1.7` (all three installing
   the latest available `1.1` version). Prerelease versions can be specified and a range will stay within the
   given tag such as `beta` or `rc`. If no version is given, it will default to `latest`.
- `terraform_wrapper` - (optional) Whether to install a wrapper to wrap subsequent calls of
   the `terraform` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs
   named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively. Defaults to `true`.

## Outputs

This action does not configure any outputs directly. However, when you set the `terraform_wrapper` input
to `true`, the following outputs are available for subsequent steps that call the `terraform` binary:

- `stdout` - The STDOUT stream of the call to the `terraform` binary.
- `stderr` - The STDERR stream of the call to the `terraform` binary.
- `exitcode` - The exit code of the call to the `terraform` binary.

The `checkpatch.pl` is a perl script to verify that your code conforms to the Linux kernel coding style. This project uses `checkpatch.pl` to automatically review and leave comments on pull requests.

## Screenshots

## Action setup guide

### Pull Request

.github/workflows/main.yml

```yml
```

For using a custom checkpatch script, pass the `CHECKPATCH_COMMAND` environment
variable. For example, for DPDK\'s `checkpatches.sh` script use:

```yml
```

**Note:** For **private repositories** this action needs access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It needs read access to `contents` and `pull-requests` as minimum permissions. For example:

```yml
```

### `checkpatch.pl` configuration

The `checkpatch.pl` tool supports a configuration file for setting options. Just create a `.checkpatch.conf` file in the top-level directory of your project and specify options in it.

<https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/checkpatch.html#type-descriptions>

#### Example for `.checkpatch.conf` file

```text
```

# RSyncer GitHub Action

[![Action on GH marketplace][marketplace badge]][marketplace] &nbsp;
[![GitHub release][release badge]][latest release] &nbsp;
[![GitHub][LICENSE badge]][LICENSE]

This action uses [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync ""Rsync\'s Homepage"") to sync files (probably) generated by a previous step in the workflow with a remote server.

</div>

## Secrets

### `DEPLOY_KEY`

**Required** SSH Key to be used during the rsync operation.

## Inputs

### `flags`

**Required** Flags to pass to rsync. Default `-avzr --delete`.

### `options`

**Required** Rsync options. i.e. `--exclude`.

### `ssh_options`

**Required** SSH command options. i.e. `-p 2222`.

### `src`

**Required** Local path to be synced. i.e. `public/`.

### `dest`

**Required** Remote server and path. i.e `user@server.com:/var/www/server.com/`.

## Outputs

### `status`

Friendly status of the rsync command.

## Usage

### Sync local folder to remote server

This example syncs the local folder *public* with the */var/www/server.com* folder on the remote server *server.com*.

Add the a workflow file in your repository: `.github/workflows/rsync.yml`.

```yml
```


### Use distinct port on remote server

This example deals with a server listening to ssh on a port other than 22.

Using a rsync workflow file: `.github/workflows/rsync.yml`, we modify the *ssh_options* input to have the *-p 2222* option:

```yml
```


## Changes

### v2.0.0 (2022-12-06)

* Address the deprecation of save-state and set-output commands [taupecat]

### v1.1.0 (2019-12-05)

* Add support to distinct remote port [ericof]

### v1.0 (2019-11-1)

* Initial release of Pendect/action-rsyncer [ericof]

This GitHub Actions runs flake8 over your code.
Any warnings or errors will be annoted in the Pull Request.

## Usage

```
```

### Parameter: path

Indicates the path to run `flake8` in.
This can be useful if your project is more than Python code.

This parameter is optional; by default `flake8` will run on your whole repository.

```
with:
  path: src
```

### Parameter: ignore

Indicates errors and warnings to skip.

This parameter is optional; by default no alerts will be ignored

```
with:
  ignore: E4,W
```


### Parameter: max_line_length

Indicates the maximum allowed line length.

This parameter is optional; by default flake8's default line length will be used.

```

450,"# Prow Github Actions \xe2\x9b\xb5\xef\xb8\x8f

This project is inspired by [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) and brings its chat-ops functionality and project management to a simple, Github actions workflow.

> Prow is a Kubernetes based CI/CD system ... and provides GitHub automation in the form of policy enforcement, chat-ops via /foo style commands, and automatic PR merging.

## Quickstart

Check out the _""EXAMPLE""_ issues and pull requests (open and closed) in this repo to see how this works!

---
Run specified actions or jobs for issue and PR comments through a `workflow.yaml` file:
```yaml
```

Automatically label PRs with the [Github actions/labeler](https://github.com/actions/labeler/blob/main/README.md) based on globs from `.github/labels.yml`:
```yaml
```

Your `.github/labels.yaml` may look like:
```yaml
```

You can automatically merge PRs based on a cron schedule if it contains the `lgtm` label:
```yaml
```

Prow Github actions also supports removing the lgtm label when a PR is updated
```yaml
```

# DEPRECATION WARNING

GitHub Action supports the functionality of this action natively with the `concurrency` command.

Please check out the release artice and the official docs:
* https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-19-github-actions-limit-workflow-run-or-job-concurrency/
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency

# Workflow run cleanup action

This action cleans up previously running instances of a workflow
on the same branch. This accomplishes the task of automatically
cancelling CI runs on pushes to the same branch, which is a common
feature in most CI systems but currently not possible with
GitHub actions.

## Configuration

* `DEBUG`: if set to `TRUE` the debug logs will be printed.

* The action uses the GitHub action environment variables
to obtain the workflow name and branch. You must, however,
set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

*Note: if you use a personal access token, ensure that the `repo` scope is included.*

## Example usage

```yaml
```

You may want to disable this action from running on tags or master,
especially if you have CD pipelines linked to your CI passing on
every commit. In that case, something like this should work:

```yaml
```

453,"# Slack Notify Build

This action prints your GitHub Action build status to Slack. It takes an opinionated approach by showing attachments for metadata like branch, pull request, and event. This action allows [existing messages to be updated](#updating-an-existing-message) to reduce unwanted noise in your Slack channel. Heavily-inspired by [Post Slack messages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/post-slack-message).

A [Slack bot token](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types) is required to use this action, and the associated app must be granted permission to post in the channel, private group or DM you specify.

## Usage

```yaml
```

The Slack notification leverages attachments to group important information together and provide valuable links:

<img src=""docs/push.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the push event"" width=""540"">

When used with the `pull_request` event, a link to the originating pull request is included:

<img src=""docs/pr.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the pull_request event"" width=""540"">

### Updating an Existing Message

If you need to send multiple Slack build updates and you prefer to update a single message instead of posting multiple messages, you can pass a `message_id` to future steps.

<img src=""docs/updating_message.gif"" alt=""Updating existing messages"" width=""540"">

Note: You must assign a step `id` to the first Slack notification step in order to reference it for future steps:

```yaml
```

### Reporting Success or Failure

You can use the `success()` and `failure()` conditional checks within your workflow to determine which build notification to send:

```yaml
```

## Inputs

### `status`

**Required** The status to show for the action, e.g. `STARTED` or `FAILED`.

### `channel`

The name of the channel to post the message to. **Required** if no `channel_id` is provided.

_Note_: If your workspace has many channels, supplying only a `channel` may cause rate limiting issues with this GitHub Action. Consider supplying a `channel_id` instead.

### `channel_id`

The ID of the channel to post the message to. **Required** if no `channel` is provided, or if you need to send to a DM.

### `color`

The color to use for the notification. Can be a hex value or any [valid Slack color level](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments#fields) (e.g. `good`). Defaults to `#cccccc`.

### `message_id`

The ID of a previous Slack message to update instead of posting a new message. Typically passed using the `steps` context:

```yaml
```

## Outputs

### `message_id`

Returns the unique message ID, which is a timestamp which can be passed to future Slack API calls as `ts`.

## Setup

To use this GitHub Action, you\'ll need a [Slack bot token](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types). A bot token must be associated with a Slack app.

### Creating a Slack App

1. **Create a Slack App.** Go to Slack\'s developer site then click ""Create an app"". Name the app ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and make sure your team\'s Slack workspace is selected under ""Development Slack Workspace"".
1. **Add a Bot user.** Browse to the ""Bot users"" page listed in the sidebar. Name your bot ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and leave the other default settings as-is.
1. **Set an icon for your bot.** Browse to the ""Basic information"" page listed in the sidebar. Scroll down to the section titled ""Display information"" to set an icon.
1. **Install your app to your workspace.** At the top of the ""Basic information"" page, you can find a section titled ""Install your app to your workspace"". Click on it, then use the button to complete the installation.

### Slack App OAuth Scopes

In order to use your Slack App with this GitHub Action, be sure to enable the following OAuth scopes:

| Scope           | Required?                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `chat:write`    | Yes                                        |
| `channels:read` | If using `channel` instead of `channel_id` |
| `groups:read`   | If using `channel` instead of `channel_id` |

This action gathers metrics about the repository and loads them to a Firebase database that you specify.

> Repo metrics will be saved into a collection named `repos`.

## Inputs

### `githubToken`

**Required** GitHub secret token. Provide `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` or a defined secret with a personal access token.

> If you provide `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` as the `githubToken` input, `totalViews` and `uniqueViews` will always be recorded as 0.

A GitHub Action that starts live environments for your pull requests and branches.

[![pullpreview](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/actions/workflows/pullpreview.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/actions/workflows/pullpreview.yml)

## Spin environments in one click

Once installed in your repository, this action is triggered any time a change
is made to Pull Requests labelled with the `pullpreview` label, or one of the
_always-on_ branches.

When triggered, it will:

1. Check out the repository code
2. Provision a cheap AWS Lightsail instance, with docker and docker-compose set up
3. Continuously deploy the specified pull requests and branches, using your docker-compose file(s)
4. Report the preview instance URL in the GitHub UI

It is designed to be the **no-nonsense, cheap, and secure** alternative to
services that require access to your code and force your app to fit within
their specific deployment system and/or require a specific config file.

## Useful for the entire team

- **Product Owners**: Interact with a new feature as it\'s built, give valuable feedback earlier, reduce wasted development time.
- **Developers**: Show your work in progress, find bugs early, deliver the right feature.
- **Ops**: Concentrate on high value tasks, not maintaining staging environments.
- **CTOs**: Don\'t let your code run on third-party servers: your code always stays private on either GitHub\'s or your servers.

## Features

Preview environments that:

- work with your **existing tooling**: If your app can be started with
  docker-compose, it can be deployed to preview environments with PullPreview.

- can be **started and destroyed easily**: You can manage preview environments
  by adding or removing the `pullpreview` label on your Pull Requests. You can
  set specific branches as always on, for instance to continuously deploy your
  master branch.

- are **cheap too run**: Preview environments are launched on AWS Lightsail
  instances, which are both very cheap (10USD per month, proratized to the
  duration of the PR), and all costs included (bandwith, storage, etc.)

- take the **privacy** of your code seriously: The workflow happens all within
  a GitHub Action, which means your code never leaves GitHub or your Lightsail
  instances.

- make the preview URL **easy to find** for your reviewers: Deployment statuses
  and URLs are visible in the PR checks section, and on the Deployments tab in
  the GitHub UI.

- **persist state** across deploys: Any state stored in docker volumes (e.g.
  database data) will be persisted across deploys, making the life of reviewers
  easier.

- are **easy to troubleshoot**: You can give specific GitHub users the
  authorization to SSH into the preview instance (with sudo privileges) to
  further troubleshoot any issue. The SSH keys that they use to push to GitHub
  will automatically be installed on the preview servers.

- are **integrated into the GitHub UI**: Logs for each deployment run are
  available within the Actions section, and direct links to the preview
  environments are available in the Checks section of a PR, and in the
  Deployments tab of the repository.

460,"# publish-release

A GitHub Action to publish a draft release.

[actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release) can create a *draft* release,
and then [actions/upload-release-asset](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset)
can upload builds and finally this action can publish the release.

This has the advantage that the latest release link (https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/latest)
always points to a fully-built release.

Note that the release must *not be marked as prerelease* for this to work.

This also means it's possible to have a stable URL for a release asset which always has the same filename:
https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/latest/download/asset-filename.tar.gz

Those URLs are documented in [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/linking-to-releases#linking-to-the-latest-release).

Minimal example workflow:

```yaml
```

**GitHub Action for setting up Snapcraft**

## Overview

This action\xe2\x80\xa6

- Installs Snapcraft on Ubuntu 18.04+/macOS
- Optionally logs you in to the Snap Store
- Allows you to run Snapcraft commands in your GitHub Actions workflows

Note that the more recently created [snapcore/action-build] and [snapcore/action-publish] effectively copy the `use_lxd` strategy (below). Building using this actions still takes ~3:30 min less time than [snapcore/action-build].

[snapcore/action-build]: https://github.com/snapcore/action-build
[snapcore/action-publish]: https://github.com/snapcore/action-publish

## Usage

### Basic

To use this action, add the following step to your workflow:

```yml
```

A full example:

```yml
```

### Log in

This action can also log you in to the Snap Store. For this to work, you need an [Ubuntu One account](https://snapcraft.io/account).

You will also need a Snap Store login token. To obtain one, run the following command on your machine:

```sh
```

NOTE: You will need to manually push a package to the Snap Store to get a valid SNAP_NAME first.

Copy that token and add it as a secret to GitHub Actions. You can do this in your GitHub repository under Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. You can name it `SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN` for convenience.

Set `SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable either in:

- root yml file: to be available for all jobs
- inside a job: to be available inside a specific job (recommended), or
- inside a step: to be available only in a specific step

```yml
```

Finally, add the following option to your workflow step:

```yml
  with:
    skip_install: true # optional, if already installed in an earlier step
```

### Build using LXD

Using `runs-on: ubuntu-20.04` or later, LXD is availabe by default. If using `runs-on: ubuntu-18.04`, LXD can be installed as shown below. This is an alternative to using `multipass` (GitHub VMs give the error `launch failed: CPU does not support KVM extensions.` when trying to use `multipass`).

```yml
```

Use the Composer CLI in your Github Actions.
============================================

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on, and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

If you are running tests like [PHPUnit][php-actions-phpunit], [phpspec][php-actions-phpspec] or [Behat][php-actions-behat] in your Github actions, chances are you will need to install your project\'s dependencies using Composer.

An example repository has been created at https://github.com/php-actions/example-composer to show how to use this action in a real project. The repository also depends on a private dependency and uses SSH keys for authentication.

Usage
-----

Create your Github Workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or similar.

```yaml
```

### Version numbers

This action is released with semantic version numbers, but also tagged so the latest major release\'s tag always points to the latest release within the matching major version.

Please feel free to use `uses: php-actions/composer@v6` to always run the latest version of v6, or `uses: php-actions/composer@v6.0.0` to specify the exact release.


Running custom commands
-----------------------

By default, adding `- uses: php-actions/composer@v6` into your workflow will run `composer install`, as `install` is the default command name. The `install` command will be provided with a default set of arguments (see below).

You can issue custom commands by passing a `command` input, like so:

```yaml
```

Passing arguments
-----------------

Any arbitrary arguments can be passed to composer by using the `args` input, however there are a few inputs pre-configured to handle common arguments. All inputs are optional. Please see the following list:

+ `interaction` - Whether to ask any interactive questions - yes / no (default `no`)
+ `dev` - Whether to install dev packages - yes / no (default `yes`)
+ `progress` - Whether to output download progress - yes / no (default `no`)
+ `quiet` - Whether to suppress all messages - yes / no (default `no`)
+ `args` - Optional arguments to pass - no constraints (default _empty_)
+ `only_args` - Only run the desired command with this args. Ignoring all other provided arguments(default _empty_)
+ `php_version` - Choose which version of PHP you want to use - x.y (default `latest`) (e.g. `7.4.29`, 8.2`, or any version listed on https://www.php.net/releases/index.php)
+ `version` - Choose which version of Composer you want to use - default `latest` (e.g. `1.10`, `2.3`, `2.5.4`)
+ `memory_limit` - Sets the composer memory limit - (default _empty_)

There are also SSH input available: `ssh_key`, `ssh_key_pub` and `ssh_domain` that are used for depending on private repositories. See below for more information on usage.

Example of a yaml config that does not want to install dev packages, and passes the `--profile` and `--ignore-platform-reqs` arguments:

```yaml
```

Using different versions of PHP or Composer
-------------------------------------------

This action runs on a custom base image, available at https://github.com/php-actions/php-build which allows for switching the active PHP version on-the-fly, and this repository allows switching of Composer versions on-the-fly.

Use the following inputs to run a specific PHP/Composer version combination:

+ `php_version` Available versions: `7.1`, `7.2`, `7.3`, `7.4`, `8.0`, `8.1` (default: `latest` aka: `8.1`)
+ `version` Available versions: `latest`, `preview`, `snapshot`, `1.x`, `2.x`, `2.2.x` or the exact version (default: `latest`)

Make sure to put the PHP version number in quotes, otherwise YAML will interpret e.g. `8.0` as `8` which means latest 8.x, not 8.0.

Example configuration that runs Composer version 1 on PHP version 7.1:
```yaml
```


Including PHP Extensions
-------------------------------------------

This action includes the [extensions that Composer suggests](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/composer.json#L44) by default. To include additional PHP extensions in your action steps, set the `php_extensions` input with any of the [supported extension names](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer#supported-php-extensions) separated by spaces.

Example configuration that runs Composer version 2 on PHP version 7.4 with the Redis and Exif extensions enabled:

```yaml
```

Caching dependencies for faster builds
--------------------------------------

Github actions supports dependency caching, allowing Composer downloads to be cached between workflows, as long as the `composer.lock` file has not changed. This produces much faster builds, as the `composer install` command does not have to download files over the network at all if the cache is valid.

Example workflow (taken from https://github.com/PhpGt/Database):

```yaml
```

In the example above, the ""key"" is passed to the Cache action that consists of a hash of the composer.lock file. This means that as long as the contents of composer.lock doesn\'t change between workflows, the Composer cache directory will be persisted between workflows.

Installing private repositories
-------------------------------

To install from a private repository, SSH authentication must be used. Generate an SSH key pair for this purpose and add it to your private repository\'s configuration, preferable with only read-only privileges. On Github for instance, this can be done by using [deploy keys][deploy-keys]. 

Add the key pair to your project using  [Github Secrets][secrets], and pass them into the `php-actions/composer` action by using the `ssh_key` and `ssh_key_pub` inputs. If your private repository is stored on another server than github.com, you also need to pass the domain via `ssh_domain`. If the private repository is configured to use a non-standard SSH port, you can configure this by passing `ssh_port`.

Example yaml, showing how to pass secrets:

```yaml
```

There is an example repository available for reference at https://github.com/php-actions/example-composer that uses a private dependency. Check it out for a live working project.

### HTTP basic authentication

It\'s recommended to use SSH keys for authentication, but sometimes HTTP basic authentication is the only tool available at the time. In order to use this authentication mechanism as securely as possible, please follow these steps:

1) Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for the Github account you wish to authenticate with.

2) Create a new GitHub Secret called `PAT` with a value of personal access token.

3) Pass this secret to COMPOSER_AUTH variable:

```yaml
```

4) Now, any connections Composer makes to GitHub.com will use your HTTP basic auth credentials, which is essentially the same as being logged in as you, so your private repositories will now be available to Composer.

phpDocumentor
=============

What is phpDocumentor?
----------------------

phpDocumentor is an application that is capable of analyzing your PHP source code and
DocBlock comments to generate a complete set of API Documentation.

Inspired by phpDocumentor 1 and JavaDoc, it continues to innovate and is up to date with the latest technologies and PHP language features.

phpDocumentor v3 (Stable)
------------------------------------

v3 is the latest stable release. 

Documentation
-------------

For more detailed information, you can check our online documentation at https://docs.phpdoc.org/.

Features
--------

phpDocumentor supports the following:

* *PHP 7.0+ compatible*, full support for Namespaces, Closures and more are provided.
* *Docblock over types*, docblocks can be more explicit about types not all formats are supported by native php.
* *Shows any tag*, some tags add additional functionality to phpDocumentor (such as @link).
* *Low memory usage*, peak memory usage for small projects is less than 20MB, medium projects 40MB, and large frameworks 100MB.
* *Incremental parsing*, if you kept the Structure file from a previous run, you get an additional performance boost of up
  to 80% on top of the mentioned processing speed increase above.
* *Easy template building*, if you want to make a branding you only have to call 1 task and edit 3 files.
* *Two-step process*, phpDocumentor first generates a cache with your application structure before creating the output.
  If you'd like you can use that to power your own tools or formatters!
* *Generics support*, with more static analysis in php types have become more complex. phpDocumentor understand these types. 
  And will render them as first class types.

Installation
------------

PhpDocumentor requires PHP 7.4 or higher to run.
However, code of earlier PHP versions can be analyzed.

All templates provided with phpDocumentor have support for Class diagrams based on the read code base.
This will require the application [Graphviz] to be installed on the machine running phpDocumentor.
Rendering the class diagrams using [Graphviz] is optional, and warnings about missing [Graphviz] can be ignored.
However, your documentation will contain some dead links in this case. Class diagram will be created with option `--setting=graphs.enabled=true`.

There are 4 ways to install phpDocumentor:

1. Using phive (recommended)
2. Using the PHAR (manual install)
3. Via [Docker]
4. Via [Composer]

### Using Phive

`$ phive install --force-accept-unsigned phpDocumentor`

For more information about phive have a look at their [website](https://phar.io/).
Now you have phpDocumentor installed, it can be executed like this:

`php tools/phpDocumentor`

### Using the PHAR

1. Download the phar file from https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/releases
2. You can execute the phar like this: `php phpDocumentor.phar`

### Via Docker

1. `$ docker pull phpdoc/phpdoc`
2. `$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data phpdoc/phpdoc`

### Via Composer (not recommended)

But wait? What about composer?

Ah, you discovered our secret. There is a phpdocumentor composer package that you can use to install phpDocumentor.

However: phpDocumentor is a complex application, and its libraries are used in countless other libraries and applications (2 of our libraries have more than 150 million downloads each); and this means that the chances for a conflict between one of our dependencies and yours is high. And when I say high, it is really high.

So, because of the above: we do not endorse nor actively support installing phpDocumentor using Composer.

### PEAR

Starting from phpDocumentor v3 we decided to drop PEAR support due to declining use.

How to use phpDocumentor?
-------------------------

The easiest way to run phpDocumentor is by running the following command:

    $ phpdoc run -d <SOURCE_DIRECTORY> -t <TARGET_DIRECTORY>

This command will parse the source code provided using the `-d` argument and output it to the folder indicated by the `-t` argument.

phpDocumentor supports a whole range of options to configure the output of your documentation.
You can execute the following command, or check our website, for a more detailed listing of available command-line options.

    $ phpdoc run -h

Configuration file(s)
---------------------

phpDocumentor also supports the use of configuration files (named phpdoc.xml or phpdoc.dist.xml by default).
Please consult the documentation to see the format and supported options.

### Nightly builds

PhpDocumentor doesn't have nightly releases.
However, during each pipeline a phar artifact is built.
If you want to test the bleeding edge version of phpDocumentor, have a look in the [actions] section of this repository.

464,"# XML Lint Action

This action validates an XML files with a given XML schema using `xmllint`.

## Inputs

### `xml-file`

**Required** The name of the source (`.xml`) file.

### `xml-schema-file`

**Required** The name of the schema (`.xsd`) file.

### `xml-schema-type`

**Optional** The type of schema to use (schema, relaxng, schematron). Default is schema.

## Basic Usage Example

This basic example validates specified XML file specified using: `xml-file` using the schema file specified using: `xml-schema-file`.

```yml
```

### Using alternate schema formats

To use an alternate schema format supported by `xmllint` (i.e. relaxng or schematron), you should specify the format of your schema using the optional `xml-schema-type` parameter.

## Extended Usage Example Enabling Annotations

This example does the same as the above example, in addition it configures the use of [korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher@v1](https://github.com/korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher), which matches any problems found by `xmllint` and present these as annotations with both errors and warnings emitted from `xmllint`, which are a nice alternative to digging through the log files.


```yml
```

## Referenes

- `xmllint` comes from [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/)

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/shalzz/zola-deploy-action?sort=semver)

A GitHub action to automatically build and deploy your [zola] site to the master
branch as GitHub Pages.

## Table of Contents

 - [Usage](#usage)
 - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
 - [Custom Domain](#custom-domain)

## Usage

In your repository **Settings > Actions > General**, in Workflow permissions, make sure that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has **Read and Write permissions**.

This example will build and deploy to gh-pages on push to the main branch.

```
```

This example will build and deploy to gh-pages branch on a push to the main branch, 
and it will build only on pull requests.
```
```

## Environment Variables
* `PAGES_BRANCH`: The git branch of your repo to which the built static files will be pushed. Default is `gh-pages` branch
* `REPOSITORY`: The target repository to push to. Default is `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`(current repository). Set this variable if you want to deploy to other repo.
* `BUILD_DIR`: The path from the root of the repo where we should run the `zola build` command. Default is `.` (current directory)
* `OUT_DIR`: The build output directory of `zola build`. Default is `public`
* `BUILD_FLAGS`: Custom build flags that you want to pass to zola while building. (Be careful supplying a different build output directory might break the action).
* `BUILD_ONLY`: Set to value `true` if you don't want to deploy after `zola build`.
* `BUILD_THEMES`: Set to false to disable fetching themes submodules. Default `true`.
* `CHECK_LINKS`: Set to `true` to check links with `zola check`.
* `CHECK_FLAGS`: Custom check flags that you want to pass to `zola check`.
* `GITHUB_HOSTNAME`: The Github hostname to use in your action. This is to account for Enterprise instances where the base URL differs from the default, which is `github.com`.


## Custom Domain

If you're using a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site put the CNAME 
in `static/CNAME` so that zola puts it in the root of the public folder
which is where GitHub expects it to be.

## :memo: Usage

Use this GitHub Action when the extensions you are adding in [setup-php](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php ""setup-php GitHub Action"") are installed and take a long time to set up. If you are using extensions which have the result `Installed and enabled` in the logs like `pecl` extensions on `Ubuntu` or extensions which have custom support, it is recommended to use this action to cache your extensions.

### Inputs

#### `php-version` (optional)

- Specify the PHP version you want to set up.
- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'8.0\'`.
- Accepts `latest` to set up the latest stable PHP version.
- Accepts `nightly` to set up a nightly build from the master branch of PHP.
- Accepts the format `d.x`, where `d` is the major version. For example `5.x`, `7.x` and `8.x`.
- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.
- If not specified, it looks for `php-version-file` input.

#### `php-version-file` (optional)

- Specify a file with the PHP version you want to set up.
- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'.phpenv-version\'`.
- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.
- By default, `.php-version` file is used.
- If not specified and the default `.php-version` file is not found, the latest stable PHP version is set up.

#### `extensions` (required)

- Specify the extensions you want to set up.
- Accepts a `string` in csv-format. For example `mbstring, xdebug, :opcache`.
- Extensions prefixed with `:` are ignored in output cache key.

#### `key` (required)

- Specify the key to identify the cache version.
- Accepts any `string`. For example `cache-v1`.
- Changing this would reset the cache.

See [action.yml](action.yml ""Metadata for this GitHub Action"") and usage below for more info.

### Workflow

> Cache extensions in a PHP workflow

```yaml
```

### Thread Safe Setup

If you set up both `TS` and `NTS` PHP versions on `Ubuntu` or `Windows` in your workflow, please add `${{ env.phpts }}` to `key` and `restore-keys` inputs in `actions/cache` step in the above workflow to avoid a conflicting cache.

```yaml
```

470,"# GitHub Action - Get a Release

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Get a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to get releases.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. My [yj](https://github.com/bruceadams/yj) project uses this Action, see [release.yml](https://github.com/bruceadams/yj/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

This Action requires that the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` be set correctly.

### Outputs

For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The release ID
- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. For example `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`
- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action
- `tag_name`: The git tag associated with the release. For example: `v1.1.0`

### Example workflow

Everytime a new release is created, build a binary for the release and upload it to the release on GitHub. This example is building and uploading a Linux binary for a Rust executable.

```yaml
```

471,"# GitHub Actions for deploying to Azure

## Automate your GitHub workflows using Azure Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow.

With [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/actions/), you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure.

## GitHub Action for Azure Login

With the [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login/blob/master/action.yml) Action, you can do an Azure login using [Azure Managed Identities and Azure service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#managed-identity-types) to run Az CLI and Azure PowerShell scripts.

- By default, the action only logs in with the Azure CLI (using the `az login` command). To log in with the Az PowerShell module, set `enable-AzPSSession` to true. To login to Azure tenants without any subscriptions, set the optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.

- To login into one of the Azure Government clouds or Azure Stack, set the optional parameter `environment` with one of the supported values `AzureUSGovernment` or `AzureChinaCloud` or `AzureStack`. If this parameter is not specified, it takes the default value `AzureCloud` and connects to the Azure Public Cloud. Additionally, the parameter `creds` takes the Azure service principal created in the particular cloud to connect (Refer to the [Configure a service principal with a secret](#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret) section below for details).
- The Action supports two different ways of authentication with Azure. One using the Azure Service Principal with secrets. The other is OpenID connect (OIDC) method of authentication using Azure [Workload Identity Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation). **We recommend using OIDC based authentication for increased security.**
- To login using Azure Service Principal with a secret, follow [this](#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret) guidance.
- To login using **OpenID Connect (OIDC) based Federated Identity Credentials**, you need to first configure trust between GitHub workflow and an Azure Managed Identity or an Azure AD App (Service Principal)
   1. Follow [this](#configure-a-federated-credential-to-use-oidc-based-authentication) guidance to create a Federated Credential associated with your Azure Managed Identity or AD App (Service Principal). This is needed to establish OIDC trust between GitHub deployment workflows and the specific Azure resources scoped by the Managed Identity/service principal.
   2. In your GitHub workflow, Set `permissions:` with `id-token: write` at workflow level or job level based on whether the OIDC token needs to be auto-generated for all Jobs or a specific Job.
   3. Within the Job deploying to Azure, add Azure/login action and pass the `client-id` and `tenant-id` of the Azure Managed Identity/service principal associated with an OIDC Federated Identity Credential created in step (i). You also need to pass `subscription-id` or set `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.

Note:

- Ensure the CLI version is 2.30 or above to use OIDC support.
- By default, Azure access tokens issued during OIDC based login could have limited validity. Azure access token issued by AD App (Service Principal) is expected to have an expiration of 1 hour by default. And with Managed Identities, it would be 24 hrs. This expiration time is further configurable in Azure. Refger to [access-token lifetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#access-token-lifetime) for more details.

Users can also specify `audience` field for access-token in the input parameters of the action. If not specified, it is defaulted to `api://AzureADTokenExchange`. This action supports login az powershell as well for both Windows and Linux runners by setting an input parameter `enable-AzPSSession: true`. Below is the sample workflow for the same using the Windows runner. Please note that powershell login is not supported in macOS runners.

```yaml
```

Refer to the [Azure Stack Hub Login Action Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/ci-cd-github-action-login-cli?view=azs-2008) for more detailed instructions.

## Configure deployment credentials
  
### Configure a service principal with a secret

For using any credentials like Azure Service Principal, Publish Profile etc add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

Follow the following steps to configure Azure Service Principal with a secret:

- Define a new secret under your repository settings, Add secret menu
- Store the output of the below [az cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) command as the value of secret variable, for example \'AZURE_CREDENTIALS\'

```bash  
```

Replace `{subscription-id}` and `{resource-group}` with the subscription and resource group details, respectively.

The command should output a JSON object similar to this:

 ```bash
  {
    ""clientId"": ""<GUID>"",
    ""clientSecret"": ""<STRING>"",
    ""subscriptionId"": ""<GUID>"",
    ""tenantId"": ""<GUID>"",
    ""resourceManagerEndpointUrl"": ""<URL>""
    (...)
  }
  
```

- Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret in Azure login action with your secret (Refer to the example above)
- Note: The above `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command will give you the `--sdk-auth` deprecation warning. As we are working with CLI for this deprecation process, we strongly recommend users to use this `--sdk-auth` flag as the result dictionary output changes and not accepted by login action if `--sdk-auth` is not used.
- If you want to pass Subscription ID, Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret as individual parameters instead of bundling them in a single JSON object (creds) to address the [security concerns](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for Non-OIDC login, below snippet can help with the same.

```yaml
```

In a similar way, any additional parameter can be added to creds such as resourceManagerEndpointUrl for Azure Stack, for example.

### Manually creating the Credentials object

If you already created and assigned a Service Principal in Azure you can manually create the .json object above by finding the `clientId` and `clientSecret` on the Service Principal, and your `subscriptionId` and `tenantId` of the subscription and tenant respectively. The `resourceManagerEndpointUrl` will be `https://management.azure.com/` if you are using the public Azure cloud.

### Configure a Federated Credential to use OIDC based authentication

Please refer to Microsoft\'s documentation at [""Configure a federated identity credential on an app\xe2\x80\x9d](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions) and [""Configure a user-assigned managed identity""](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity?pivots=identity-wif-mi-methods-azp#github-actions-deploying-azure-resources) to trust an external identity provider (preview) which has more details about the Azure Workload Identity Federation (OIDC) support.

You can add federated credentials in the Azure portal or with the Microsoft Graph REST API.

## Support for using `allow-no-subscriptions` flag with az login

Capability has been added to support access to tenants without subscriptions for both OIDC and non-OIDC. This can be useful to run tenant level commands, such as `az ad`. The action accepts an optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` which is `false` by default.

```yaml
```

## Az logout and security hardening

This action doesn\'t implement ```az logout``` by default at the end of execution. However there is no way of tampering the credentials or account information because the github hosted runner is on a VM that will get reimaged for every customer run which gets everything deleted. But if the runner is self-hosted which is not github provided it is recommended to manually logout at the end of the workflow as shown below. More details on security of the runners can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners).

```yaml
```

## Az CLI dependency

Internally in this action, we use azure CLI and execute `az login` with the credentials provided through secrets. In order to validate the new az CLI releases for this action, [canary test workflow](.github/workflows/azure-login-canary.yml) is written which will execute the action on [az CLI\'s edge build](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#edge-builds) which will fail incase of any breaking change is being introduced in the new upcoming release. The test results can be posted on a slack or teams channel using the corresponding integrations. Incase of a failure, the concern will be raised to [azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) for taking a necessary action and also the latest CLI installation will be postponed in [Runner VMs](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) as well for hosted runner to prevent the workflows failing due to the new CLI changes.

472,"# GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Web App

With the Azure App Service Actions for GitHub, you can automate your workflow to deploy [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) or [Azure Web Apps for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/) using GitHub Actions.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source).

This repository contains GitHub Action for Azure WebApp to deploy to an Azure WebApp (Windows or Linux). The action supports deploying a folder, *\\*.jar*, *\\*.war*, and \\**.zip* files (except msBuild generated packages).

You can also use this GitHub Action to deploy your customized image into an Azure WebApps container.

For deploying container images to Kubernetes, consider using [Kubernetes deploy](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-deploy) action. This action requires that the cluster context be set earlier in the workflow by using either the [Azure/aks-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/aks-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action or the [Azure/k8s-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action.

The definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy/blob/master/action.yml). *startup-command* is applicable only for Linux apps and not for Windows apps. Currently *startup-command* is supported only for Linux apps when SPN is provided and not when publish profile is provided.

NOTE: you must have write permissions to the repository in question. If you\'re using a sample repository from Microsoft, be sure to first fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

# End-to-End Sample Workflows

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions

* [Checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) your Git repository content into GitHub Actions agent.
* Authenticate using [Azure Web App Publish Profile](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-credentials#site-credentials-aka-publish-profile-credentials) or using the [Azure Login Action](https://github.com/Azure/login). Examples of both are given later in this article.

    The action supports using publish profile for [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) (both Windows and Linux) and [Azure Web Apps for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/) (both Windows and Linux).
    
 **Note: As of October 2020, Linux web apps will need the app setting `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` set to `true` before downloading the publish profile from the portal. This requirement will be removed in the future.**

    The action does not support multi-container scenario with publish profile.
* Enable [Run from Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-run-package#enable-running-from-package), otherwise remote build will take time and the deployment will take longer. 

* To build app code in a specific language based environment, use setup actions:
  * [Setup DotNet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) Sets up a dotnet environment by optionally downloading and caching a version of dotnet by SDK version and adding to PATH.
  * [Setup Node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) sets up a node environment by optionally downloading and caching a version of node - npm by version spec and add to PATH
  * [Setup Python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) sets up Python environment by optionally installing a version of python and adding to PATH.
  * [Setup Java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) sets up Java app environment optionally downloading and caching a version of java by version and adding to PATH. Downloads from [Azul\'s Zulu distribution](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/).

* To build and deploy a containerized app, use [docker-login](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login) to log in to a private container registry such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/).

Once login is done, the next set of Actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.
  
## Create Azure Web App and deploy using GitHub Actions

Note: Workflow samples with sample application code and deployment procedure for various **runtime** environments are given at https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService.

For example, if You want to deploy a Java WAR based app, You can follow the link https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Java-application-petstore-ee7 in the sample workflow templates.

0. Review the pre-requisites outlined in the [""Dependencies on Other Github Actions""](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy#dependencies-on-other-github-actions) section above.
1. Create a web app in Azure using app service. Follow the tutorial [Azure Web Apps Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview#next-steps).
2. Pick a template from the following table depends on your Azure web app **runtime** and place the template to `.github/workflows/` in your project repository.
3. Change `app-name` to your Web app name created in the first step.
4. Commit and push your project to GitHub repository, you should see a new GitHub Action initiated in **Actions** tab.

### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js Web app to Azure using publish profile

```yaml
```

### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js app to Containerized WebApp using publish profile

```yaml
```
Webapps deploy Actions is supported for the Azure public cloud as well as Azure government clouds (\'AzureUSGovernment\' or \'AzureChinaCloud\') and Azure Stack (\'AzureStack\') Hub. Before running this action, login to the respective Azure Cloud  using [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) by setting appropriate value for the `environment` parameter.

#### Configure deployment credentials:

For any credentials like Azure Service Principal, Publish Profile etc add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

The above example uses app-level credentials i.e., publish profile file for deployment. 

Follow the steps to configure the secret:

* **Note: As of October 2020, Linux web apps will need the app setting `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` set to `true` before continuing with next step of downloading the publish profile. This requirement will be removed in the future.**
* Download the publish profile for the WebApp from the portal (Get Publish profile option)
* While deploying to slot, download the publish profile for slot. Also specify the `slot-name` field with the name of the slot.
* Define a new secret under your repository settings, Add secret menu
* Paste the contents for the downloaded publish profile file into the secret\'s value field
* Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret for the input `publish-profile:` of the deploy Azure WebApp action (Refer to the example above)

### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js app to Containerized WebApp using Azure service principal

Use [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) with a service principal that\'s authorized for Web app deployment. Once login is done, the next set of Azure actions in the workflow can re-use the same session within the job.

```yaml
```

#### Configure deployment credentials:

The previous sample workflow depends on user-level credentials stored as a [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your repository. The value of this secret is expected to be a JSON object that represents a service principal (an identifer for an application or process) that authenticates the workflow with Azure.

To function correctly, this service principal must be assigned the [Contributor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)) role for the web app or the resource group that contains the web app.

The following steps describe how to create the service principal, assign the role, and create a secret in your repository with the resulting credentials.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com). You can alternately use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you\'ve installed it locally. (For more information on Cloud Shell, see the [Cloud Shell Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).)
  
2. Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command to create a service principal and assign a Contributor role:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""{sp-name}"" --sdk-auth --role contributor \\
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name}
    ```

    Replace the following:
      * `{sp-name}` with a suitable name for your service principal, such as the name of the app itself. The name must be unique within your organization.
      * `{subscription-id}` with the subscription you want to use
      * `{resource-group}` the resource group containing the web app.
      * `{app-name}` with the name of the web app.

    This command invokes Azure Active Directory (via the `ad` part of the command) to create a service principal (via `sp`) specifically for [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (via `create-for-rbac`).

    The `--role` argument specifies the permissions to grant to the service principal at the specified `--scope`. In this case, you grant the built-in [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role at the scope of the web app in the specified resource group in the specified subscription.

    If desired, you can omit the part of the scope starting with `/providers/...` to grant the service principal the Contributor role for the entire resource group:

    ```azurecli  
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""{sp-name}"" --sdk-auth --role contributor \\
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}
    ```

    For security purposes, however, it\'s always preferable to grant permissions at the most restrictive scope possible.

3. When complete, the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command displays JSON output in the following form (which is specified by the `--sdk-auth` argument):

    ```json
    {
      ""clientId"": ""<GUID>"",
      ""clientSecret"": ""<GUID>"",
      ""subscriptionId"": ""<GUID>"",
      ""tenantId"": ""<GUID>"",
      (...)
    }
    ```

4. In your repository, use **Add secret** to create a new secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (as shown in the example workflow), or using whatever name is in your workflow file.

5. Paste the entire JSON object produced by the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command as the secret value and save the secret.

NOTE: to manage service principals created with `az ad sp create-for-rbac`, visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Active Directory, then select **Manage** > **App registrations** on the left-hand menu. Your service principal should appear in the list. Select a principal to navigate to its properties. You can also manage role assignments using the [az role assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest) command.

#### Configure web app private registry credentials

This sample assumes the `node-rnc` web application has been previously configured to authenticate against the private registry. If you wish to set private registry authentication settings on the workflow, you can either use:

* The command [az webapp config container](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp/config/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-container-set) to configure the registry url, username and password.

* Setup the authentication settings using [azure/appservice-settings action](https://github.com/Azure/appservice-settings), like this for example

```yaml
```

Automatically add an issue or pull request to specific [GitHub Project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) when you __create__ and/or __label__ them. By default, the issues are assigned to the __`To do`__ column and the pull requests to the __`In progress`__ one, so make sure you have those columns in your project dashboard. But the workflow __allowed you to specify the column name as input__, so you can assign the issues/PRs based on a set of conditions to a specific column of a specific project.

## Latest features:

* included `issue_comment` as trigger for this action.
* added project pagination for searching 100+ GitHub projects.

## Acknowledgment & Motivations

This action has been modified from the original action from [masutaka](https://github.com/masutaka/github-actions-all-in-one-project). I needed to fix it as the original docker container would not build. Also I think the GitHub Action syntax changed a bit.

I would like to thank @SunRunAway for adding the labelling functionality and custom column input.

## Inputs

### `project`

**Required** The url of the project to be assigned to.

### `column_name`

The column name of the project, defaults to `'To do'` for issues and `'In progress'` for pull requests.

## Example usage

Examples of action:

### Repository project

```yaml
```

#### __Notes__
Be careful of using the conditions above (opened and labeled issues/PRs) because in such workflow, if the issue/PR is opened and labeled at the same time, it will be assigned to __both__ projects!


You can use any combination of conditions. For example, to assign new issues or issues labeled with 'mylabel' to a project column, use:
```yaml
```

### Organisation or User project

Generate a token from the Organisation settings or User Settings and add it as a secret in the repository secrets as `MY_GITHUB_TOKEN`

```yaml
```

## Changelog Enforcer

The purpose of this action is to enforce that every pull request in a repository includes a change to an ongoing changelog file. Inspired by [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), this action helps development teams to keep a change file up to date as new features or fixes are implemented. 

### Usage

To use this action, follow the typical GitHub Action `uses` syntax. An example workflow using the default parameters of this action is shown below:

```yaml
```

Other examples can be seen in the [example-workflows](./example-workflows) directory in this repository.

_:warning: The Changelog Enforcer is designed to be used with the `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` event types. Using this action on any other event type will result in a warning logged and the action succeeding (as to not block the rest of a workflow)._

### Inputs / Properties

Below are the properties allowed by the Changelog Enforcer. These properties are shipped with sane defaults for typical use, especially for changelogs inline with the [KeepAChangelog](Keepachangelog.org) format.

#### `changeLogPath`
* Default: `CHANGELOG.md`
* The path to your changelog file. Should be from the perspective of the root directory to `git`. The file being checked for updates must be either an add (`A`) or modified (`M`) status to `git` to qualify as updated. 

#### `skipLabels` 
* Default: `\'Skip-Changelog\'` 
* List of labels used to skip enforcing of the changelog during a pull request. Each label name is comma separated and only one label needs to be present for enforcement to be skipped.

  For example, if `label-1,label-2` was supplied as the `skipLabels`, `label-1` _or_ `label-2` would skip the enforcer. Each label is trimmed for leading and trailing spaces since GitHub labels do not allow for leading or trailing spaces. Thus, the following lists are equivalent:
  * `label-1,label-2`
  * `label-1 , label-2`
  * `label-1  ,label-2`

#### `missingUpdateErrorMessage`
* Default: `\'\'`
* Custom error message to use when no update to the changelog is found.

#### `expectedLatestVersion`
* Default: `\'\'`
* The latest version of the software expected in the changelog. Should be in the form of `v1.1.0`, `v3.5.6` etc. Allows for the first version in the changelog to be an unreleased      version (either `unreleased|Unreleased|UNRELEASED`) before checking versions. If the only version in the changelog is an unreleased version, no validation occurs. This is to support a repository adding a changelog after other versions have been released and don\'t want to backport previous versions (though doing so is recommended).

#### `versionPattern`
* Default: `\'## \\\\[((v|V)?\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*-?\\\\w*|unreleased|Unreleased|UNRELEASED)\\\\]\'`
* A regex pattern used to extract the version section headings from the changelog. The Changelog Enforcer assumes the use of the [KeepAChangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) convention for section headings, and as such looks for a line starting with `## [version] - date`. Versions are only extracted from the changelog when enforcing the expected latest version (via the `expectedLatestVersion` property).

  If you supply your own regex to match a different format, your regex must match the version string as a capture group (in the default format, that\'s the part inside square brackets). The first capture group will be used if your regex includes multiple groups. The regex pattern is used with global and multiline flags to find all of the versions in the changelog.

  Because the regex is passed as a `String` object, you will need to escape backslash characters (`\\`) via `\\\\`.

#### `token`
* Default: `${{ github.token }}`
* The token used to authenticate to the GitHub API. Uses the default token from the `github.token` context. Can be any access token you have  configured for your repository.

### Outputs

#### `errorMessage`
* The reason for why the Changelog Enforcer failed. Uses the `missingUpdateErrorMessage` property value if set when no update to the changelog is found.

### Creating Releases Automatically

Using this Action and the [Changelog Reader](https://github.com/mindsers/changelog-reader-action), plus a few standard GitHub created Actions, we can keep the changelog of a project up to date and create a GitHub release automatically with contents from the changelog. See this project\'s [release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml) for how to set up a simple workflow to create a new release based on a `VERSION` file and a changelog.

This GitHub Action installs Python package dependencies from a user-defined `requirements.txt` file path with `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` installs/updates during execution.  A Python package environment report is displayed at the end of Action execution.

This Action is tested nightly with cPython v3.8.x - v3.11.x in the latest Linux, macOS, and Windows GitHub Actions runner environments.

## Quick Start

Insert a dependency installation step under the `steps:` field in a GitHub workflow job with a configuration like this:

### Default

Uses path `requirements.txt` and updates `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` before the install.

```yaml
```

### Define the `requirements.txt` path

Define a requirements.txt file on a path relative to the root of your repository.

```yaml
    with:
      path: ""path/to/requirements.txt""
```

### Toggle `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` installs/updates off

The `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` install/updates can be toggled off in your configuration. Use one or more of the `update-pip`, `update-setuptools`, and `update-wheel` settings with a boolean string to customize the default behavior:

```yaml
    with:
      update-pip: ""false""
      update-setuptools: ""false""
      update-wheel: ""false""
```

## Inputs

### `path`

**Optional** The `requirements.txt` file path relative to the root of your source repository. Default = `""requirements.txt""`.

### `update-pip`

**Optional** A boolean string indicating that a `pip` package update should occur before the dependency installation. Options: [`""true""`, `""false""`].  Default=`""true""`

### `update-setuptools`

**Optional** A boolean string indicating that a `setuptools` package update should occur before the dependency installation. Options: [`""true""`, `""false""`].  Default=`""true""`

### `update-wheel`

**Optional** A boolean string indicating that a `wheel` package update should occur before the dependency installation. Options: [`""true""`, `""false""`].  Default=`""true""`

479,"# GitHub Action - Releases API
This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Create a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to create releases.

<a href=""https://github.com/actions/create-release""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/create-release/workflows/Tests/badge.svg""></a>

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

- `tag_name`: The name of the tag for this release
- `release_name`: The name of the release
- `draft`: `true` to create a draft (unpublished) release, `false` to create a published one. Default: `false`
- `prerelease`: `true` to identify the release as a prerelease. `false` to identify the release as a full release. Default `false`

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The release ID
- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`
- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action

### Example workflow - create a release
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):

```yaml
```

This will create a [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases), as well as a [`release` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#releaseevent), which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action.

GitHub now offers a much cleaner way to handle linters with complex projects and provide annotations on PRs. [The problem matcher format](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/problem-matchers.md) is now the best way to handle this.

[`actions/setup-node`](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) provides ESLint annotations by default now, and it is the best solution for lint annotations in PRs. See https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/.github/eslint-stylish.json as an example of the problem matcher format.

# ESLint Action (abandoned)

This is a GitHub Action that runs ESLint for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` and `.tsx` files using your `.eslintrc` rules. It's free to run and it'll annotate the diffs of your pull requests with lint errors and warnings.

Github Action to lint with &#x60;standard&#x60;

[Usage](#usage) - [License: Apache-2.0](#license)

![Screenshot with Annotations](screenshot.png)

## Usage

In a Github Actions workflow file, do something like:

```yaml
```

To use a different linter than `standard`, or use a specific version of `standard`, add it as a devDependency to your project, and run `npm install` in your workflow so the action can `require()` it.

```yaml
```

If you do not install any linter yourself, this action will use Standard v14.

[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/skaut/wordpress-version-checker?logo=codecov)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/skaut/wordpress-version-checker)

A GitHub action to automatically create issues when a plugin ""tested up to"" version doesn\'t match the latest WordPress version.

## Usage

This action fires on every push to `master` and once every day if you use this recommended config:

```yaml
```

## Configuration

The app doesn\'t stricly require any configuration, however you can configure some aspects of its function by placing a file named `.wordpress-version-checker.json` in the root of your repository. The file may contain any of the following configuration options:

### Plugin readme location

By default, the app checks for readme in `readme.txt` and `plugin/readme.txt`. If the readme of your plugin is not in one of these locations, you can configure the app to look somewhere else with the `readme` value in the configuration. The value can be either a single location or an array of locations to check - if multiple locations are provided, they will be checked in the given order until the first match.

#### Examples

```json
```

```json
```

### WordPress release channel

By default, the app will only notify you once the new WordPress version is released (**This will change** - starting from version 2.0, the default value will be changed to `rc`). By setting the `channel` value to one of `stable` or `rc`, you can choose to be notified when the new version is fully release, is in the release candidate (RC) stage of development or when the first beta versions are released.

#### Example

```json
```

### Issue assignees

By default, the issue will have no assignees. If you want the issues to be automatically assigned to someone, you can put their GitHub usernames in the config as the `assignees` value.

#### Example

```json
```
