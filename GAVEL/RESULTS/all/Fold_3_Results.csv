Path to the directory containing the `extensions/` folder (including trailing slash). Default `""""`.\n6. Whether to create module archives as build artifacts (set to `true`). Default `false`.\n7. Host of database. Default `mysql`.\n    - Note that during a workflow\'s execution all containers (job, service, actions) get attached to the same user defined bridge network on the host, meaning all the containers can reach each other over that network, not via the host\'s localhost networking. Thus, this action connects to your database using the name of the corresponding service as hostname.\n8. Port of database.

488,"b'# MariaDB GitHub Action\n\nThis [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) sets up a MariaDB database.\n\nIt is based on the Docker container and is limited by Github Actions, which contains only Linux now. Therefore it does not work in Mac OS and Windows environment.\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: getong/mariadb-action@v1.1\n  with:\n    host port: 3800 # Optional, default value is 3306. The port of host\n    container port: 3307 # Optional, default value is 3306. The port of container\n    character set server: \'utf8\' # Optional, default value is \'utf8mb4\'. The \'--character-set-server\' option for mysqld\n    collation server: \'utf8_general_ci\' # Optional, default value is \'utf8mb4_general_ci\'. The \'--collation-server\' option for mysqld\n    mariadb version: \'10.4.10\' # Optional, default value is ""latest"". The version of the MariaDB\n    mysql database: \'some_test\' # Optional, default value is ""test"". The specified database which will be create\n    mysql root password: ${{ secrets.RootPassword }} # Required if ""mysql user"" is empty, default is empty. The root superuser password\n    mysql user: \'developer\' # Required if ""mysql root password"" is empty, default is empty. The superuser for the specified database. Can use secrets, too\n    mysql password: ${{ secrets.DatabasePassword }} # Required if ""mysql user"" exists. The password for the ""mysql user""\n```\n\nSee [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) for available versions.\n\nSee [Creating and using secrets (encrypted variables)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) for hiding database password.\n\n## The Default MySQL\n\nMySQL *may* be installed and started by Github Actions (aka. the Default MySQL), that version is 5.7 generally, root superuser password is ""root"" and port is 3306. See [Software in virtual environments for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions).\n\nSo before set-up a MySQL which host port is 3306 in Docker, please make sure the Default MySQL has been shutted-down. Otherwise, action will fail and print an error log that looks like: `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use.` (See [#2](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/issues/2))\n\nSure, if you do not care about MySQL options, such as version, bound port, character set, character collation, root password, etc., you can use the Default MySQL instead of this Action.\n\n### Shutdown the Default MySQL\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-${{ ubuntu-version }} # is Ubuntu environment\n\n    # ... some other config ...\n\n    steps:\n    - # ... some prepare steps, like action/checkout, run some script without MySQL, etc.\n\n    - name: Shutdown Ubuntu MySQL (SUDO)\n      run: sudo service mysql stop # Shutdown the Default MySQL, ""sudo"" is necessary, please not remove it\n\n    - # ... some steps before set-up MySQL ...\n    - name: Set up MariaDB\n      uses: getong/mariadb-action@v1.1\n      with:\n        # ...

Each matcher has to be registered with Github Actions by adding `::add-matcher::/path/to/matcher.json` to the output.\n\nThis action generates regular expressions based on the Github workspace, writes out matcher files and then registers them with the Action runner.\n\nIt uses the Teamcity output as it contains all of the required information (file path, failure message and line number).\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Allows multiple comma-separated tags (e.g. `one,another`) (default: `latest`).  \n  If you set **compose_file** and the image(s) already has/have a tag, this is ignored.\n\n- **registry**: Docker registry (default: *Docker Hub\'s registry*). You need a registry to use the cache functionality.\n\n- **username**: Docker registry\'s user (needed to push images, or to pull from a private repository).\n\n- **password**: Docker registry\'s password (needed to push images, or to pull from a private repository).\n\n- **session**: Extra auth parameters. For AWS ECR, means setting AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variable.\n\n- **push_git_tag**: In addition to `image_tag`, you can also push the git tag in your [branch tip][branch tip] (default: `false`).\n\n- **pull_image_and_stages**: Set to `false` to avoid pulling from the registry or to build from scratch (default: `true`).\n\n- **stages_image_name**: Set custom name for stages. Useful if using a job matrix (default: `$image_name-stages)`.\n\n- **build_extra_args**: Extra params for `docker build` (e.g. `""--build-arg=hello=world""`).  \n  > :star2: New in v5.11.0: If you need extra args with newlines or spaces, use json format like this:  \n    `build_extra_args: \'{""--build-arg"": ""myarg=Hello\\nWorld""}\'`\n\n  > :star2: If you need multiple args with same key, use an array as the value of the key like this:  \n    `build_extra_args: \'{""--build-arg"": [""foo=bar"", ""one=two""]}\'`\n\n- **push_image_and_stages**: Test a command before pushing. Use `false` to not push at all (default: `true`).\n\n    This input also supports 2 special values, which are useful if your workflow can be triggered by different events:\n\n    - `on:push`: Push only if the workflow was triggered by a push.\n    - `on:pull_request`: Push only if the workflow was triggered by a pull_request.\n\n- **services_regex**: Regex to filter services from compose file. Only valid when **compose_file** was provided. Default is `.+` (all services).\n\n[branch tip]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16080342/what-is-a-branch-tip-in-git\n\n#### Ignored if `compose_file` is set\n\n- **image_name**\n\n- **context**: Docker context (default: `./`).\n\n- **dockerfile**: Dockerfile filename path (default: `""$context""/Dockerfile`).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **FULL_IMAGE_NAME**: Full name of the Docker Image with the Registry (if provided) and Namespace included.  \ne.g.: `docker.pkg.github.com/whoan/hello-world/hello-world`\n\n## How it works\n\nThe action does the following every time it is triggered:\n\n- (Optional) Pull previously pushed [stages](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) (if any) from the specified `registry` (default: https://hub.docker.com)\n- Build the image using cache (i.e. the pulled stages)\n- Tag the image\n- (Optional) Push the image with the tag(s) specified in `image_tag`\n- (Optional) Push each stage to the registry with names like `<image_name>-stages:<1,2,3,...>`\n- (Optional) Push the git tag as `<image_name>:<git_tag>` if you set `push_git_tag: true`\n\n## Examples\n\nFind working minimal examples for the most known registries in [this repo](https://github.com/whoan/hello-world/tree/master/.github/workflows).\n\n### Docker Hub\n\n> If you don\'t specify a registry, Docker Hub is the default one\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}""\n    image_name: hello-world\n```\n\n### GitHub Registry\n\n> [GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret). If you are going to use the new GitHub Registry (ghcr.io), be sure to use a Personal Access Token (as the password) with ""write:packages"" and ""read:packages"" scopes. More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#migrating-a-docker-image-using-the-docker-cli).\n\n> If you push the image to a **public** repository\'s GitHub Registry, please be aware that it will be impossible to delete it because of GitHub\'s policy (see [Deleting a package](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/deleting-a-package)).\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n    registry: docker.pkg.github.com\n    #or\n    #registry: ghcr.io\n    image_name: hello-world\n```\n\n### Google Cloud Registry\n\n> More info [here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key) on how to get GCloud JSON key.\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: _json_key\n    password: ""${{ secrets.GCLOUD_JSON_KEY }}""\n    registry: gcr.io\n    image_name: hello-world\n```\n\n### AWS ECR\n\n> You don\'t even need to create the repositories in advance, as this action takes care of that for you! (you\'ll need the `CreateRepository` permission)\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: ""${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}""  # no need to provide it if you already logged in with aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials\n    password: ""${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}""  # no need to provide it if you already logged in with aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials\n    session:  ""${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN }}""  # if you need role assumption. no need to provide it if you already logged in with aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials\n    # private registry\n    registry: 861729690598.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com\n    # or public registry\n    #registry: public.ecr.aws\n    image_name: hello-world\n```\n\n### From a compose file\n\n> The compose file is parsed and the action will run once for each detected image. The registry is also detected from the image name, and if none is provided, DockerHub is assumed.\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}""\n    compose_file: docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n    registry: docker.pkg.github.com\n    compose_file: docker-compose.yml\n```\n\nWith a compose file override:\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}""\n    compose_file: docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.override.yml\n```\n\nFiltering services by regex:\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n    registry: docker.pkg.github.com\n    compose_file: docker-compose.yml\n    services_regex: \'(service_1|extra_service.*)\' # eg: builds services called exactly ""service_1"" plus the ones which start with ""extra_service"" and may have extra chars after\n```\n\n### Example with more options\n\n```yml\n- uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5\n  with:\n    username: whoan\n    password: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n    image_name: whoan/docker-images/node\n    image_tag: alpine-slim,another-tag,latest\n    push_git_tag: true\n    registry: docker.pkg.github.com\n    context: node-alpine-slim\n    dockerfile: custom.Dockerfile\n    build_extra_args: ""--compress=true --build-arg=hello=world""\n    push_image_and_stages: docker run my_awesome_image:latest  # eg: push only if docker run succeed\n```\n\n## Cache is not working?\n\n- Be specific with the base images. e.g.: if you start from an image with the `latest` tag, it may download different versions when the action is triggered, and it will invalidate the cache.\n- If you are using Buildkit, the stages won\'t be pushed to the registry. This might be supported in a future version.\n- Some docker limitations might cause the cache not to be used correctly.

See [Configuring Docker for use with GitHub Package Registry](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-package-registry/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-package-registry#publishing-a-package) for more information.\nIf you\'re using GitHub Packages, you might also want to use `${{ github.actor }}` as the `username`.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: owner/repository/image\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  registry: docker.pkg.github.com\n```\n\n### snapshot\nUse `snapshot` to push an additional image, which is tagged with  \n`{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}{HOUR}{MINUTE}{SECOND}{first 6 digits of the git sha}`.  \nThe date was inserted to prevent new builds with external dependencies override older builds with the same sha.\nWhen you would like to think about versioning images, this might be useful.  \n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  snapshot: true\n```\n\n### dockerfile\nUse `dockerfile` when you would like to explicitly build a Dockerfile.  \nThis might be useful when you have multiple DockerImages.  \n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  dockerfile: MyDockerFileName\n```\n\n### workdir\nUse `workdir` when you would like to change the directory for building.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  workdir: mySubDirectory\n```\n\n### context\nUse `context` when you would like to change the Docker build context.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  context: myContextDirectory\n```\n\n### buildargs\nUse `buildargs` when you want to pass a list of environment variables as [build-args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg). Identifiers are separated by comma.   \nAll `buildargs` will be masked, so that they don\'t appear in the logs.  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@master\n  env:\n    MY_FIRST: variableContent\n    MY_SECOND: variableContent\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    buildargs: MY_FIRST,MY_SECOND\n```\n\n### buildoptions\nUse `buildoptions` when you want to configure [options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for building.  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@master\n  env:\n    MY_FIRST: variableContent\n    MY_SECOND: variableContent\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    buildoptions: ""--compress --force-rm""\n```\n\n### cache\nUse `cache` when you have big images, that you would only like to build partially (changed layers).  \n> CAUTION: Docker builds will cache non-repoducable commands, such as installing packages. If you use this option, your packages will never update. To avoid this, run this action on a schedule with caching **disabled** to rebuild the cache periodically.\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish to Registry\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \'0 2 * * 0\' # Weekly on Sundays at 02:00\njobs:\n  update:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - name: Publish to Registry\n      uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@master\n      with:\n        name: myDocker/repository\n        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n        cache: ${{ github.event_name != \'schedule\' }}\n```\n\n### tag_names\nUse `tag_names` when you want to push tags/release by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/MY_TAG_NAME`).  \n> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  tag_names: true\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below.

According to Github, a release *must* be tagged by a human; release artifacts *must* be built by a human; and then specific binary assets *must be* uploaded by a human into that release.\n\nThis update-release action *breaks down* those expectations.  Any branch, tag, or indeed *any Github checkin at all*, can now be continuously integrated via Github runners, with its build products continuously accessible to you, your team, or the world, via Github releases.\n\nWith this action, Github runners can build, test, and package artifacts on *any* Github ref, branch, or tag.  This action continuously creates and updates the necessary Github tags and releases with these artifacts.\n\nThis update-release action makes sane choices all the way along this process, but it lets you override those choices easily. Every time a Github runner builds your source code, update-release creates or updates a [Github release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases) for your assets, and then uploads the freshly built assets into your release.  Existing releases are reused, and existing assets with the same names are replaced.\n\nBecause this action is written in [TypeScript](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and executes in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), it runs on *all* Github\'s supported build runner platforms. These include Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu as of this writing.\n\n## why another build publisher?\n\nBecause no existing Github action implements *all* of what is needed to do continuous releasing on Github.\n\nGithub\'s new [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) system permits a user to perform a build on Windows, MacOS, or Ubuntu.  Classically, the result of a build is usually a zip file or some other distribution file that developers would like to download and distribute.  \n\nBut getting a file result out of any Github action build process is harder than it ought to be.  Sure, you could upload the file to your own server at build completion, but then you\'d be ignoring Github\'s own file distribution and release architecture.\n\nYou\'ll have to check for the existence of any release before you create it, and you\'ll have to check for the existence of any asset already in a release with the same name, and delete it, before you upload the newly built asset.\n\nOr, you could just use this Github action, update-release, which does all that in one step.  As of this writing, no other continuous integration plugin makes sane choices for all these steps.\n\n## guide\n\nOnce your build has successfully completed, update-release will choose a friendly release name for your build.  Regardless of whether the ref that triggered the build is a tag or a branch, you\'ll get a human-friendly release name.  You can of course override the default choice. If the Github release name already exists, it is reused; otherwise, it is created.\n\n## inputs\n\nThe following parameters are accepted as inputs to the update-release action.\n\n### token\n\nThis should be [your secure Github token](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token). Use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` as the parameter if your build lasts less than an hour.\n\nIf your build lasts more than an hour, you will need to [create your own access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with repo admin access, [store it as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) in your own repository, and reference that secret token in your build.\n\nThis parameter is required.\n\n### files\n\nThis should be the paths to files that you wish to add to the release.  Presumbly, this should include at least the file(s) you just built.  File paths can be provided as absolute paths, or they can alternately be relative to `${{ github.workspace }}`.  \n\nThis parameter is required.\n\n### release\n    \nThe name of the release to be created. A reasonable-looking release name will be created from the current `${{ github.ref }}` if this input is not supplied. This reasonable looking default is created by taking `${{ github.ref }}`, removing the prefixes `refs/`, `heads/`, and `tags/` , and then replacing any remaining forward-slash symbols `/` with dashes `-`.\n\nIf you don\'t like this behavior, just override the release name here yourself.\n\nThis parameter is not required.\n\n### tag\n\nThe name of the tag to be created. For some inexplicable reason, Github thinks that you need to have a tag corresponding to every release, which makes no sense if you\'re using Github to do continuous integration builds.  The tag will be the same as the calculated name of the release, if this input is not supplied. \n\nThis parameter is not required.\n\n### message\n\nA brief description of the tag and also of the release. This parameter is not required.\n\n### body\n\nA longer decsription of the release, if it is created. This parameter is not required.\n\n### prerelease\n\nShould the release, if created, be marked as a prerelease?  Such releases are generally publicly visible.  Provide true or false as a parameter.\n\nThe default setting is `true`.\n\n### draft\n\nShould the release, if created, be marked as a draft?  Such releases are generally not publicly visible.  Provide true or false as a parameter.\n\nThe default setting is `false`.\n    \n## outputs\n\nIf assets are successfully published, you will get the following outputs from the step, which you can use in later processing.\n\nThe following parameters are provided as outputs to this Github action.\n\n### files\n\nThe calculated local paths of the files to be uploaded into the release.\n\n### draft\n\nWhether the release, if created, was marked as a draft.\n\n### prerelease\n\nWhether the release, if created, was marked as a prerelease.\n\n### release\n\nThe name of the release.\n\n### tag\n\nThe tag used to create the release.\n\n## internals\n\nThis Github action was written for [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release), and it uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in order to run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) before bundling.  Use [npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) to install all package.json dependencies of update-release, before hacking on it.\n\nDevelopment is done in Visual Studio Code.  It\'s necessary to manually build a target before debugging it.  The `test` target is for debugging; `test-watch` watches for and recompiles any changes for debugging; `bundle` minifies the current `src/main.ts` into `dist/main.js` for release.\n\nSeveral [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) targets were added to speed along development.  The `test` run target builds readable `dist/main.js` and `dist/main.map.js` files, for source-level debugging of the TypeScript.  A `test-watch` run target watches the `src/main.ts` file for changes, and lints and recompiles it as needed.  And, a `bundle` run target prepares a production minified `dist/main.js`.\n\nThis action uses the `dotenv` import in order to facilitate debugging.  This import reads a `.env` file, if it exists, as the root of the installation, and uses it to populate environmental variables for local testing of update-release.  A typical .env file for developing update-release, might look something like this:\n\n    INPUT_ASSET=your-build-asset.zip\n    INPUT_TOKEN=00000000000000000000000000000001\n    GITHUB_REPOSITORY=you/your-repo\n    GITHUB_REF=refs/heads/master\n    GITHUB_WORKSPACE=/absolute/local/path/to/workspace\n\nUsing an `.env` file, you can perform local testing and debugging of update-release without having to build a product first.\n\n### security concerns\n\nYou *should* review the source code of this -- and *all other!* -- Github actions, to verify that they don\'t store, transmit, or otherwise mistreat your secure Github token.\n\nWhen you provide your secure access token to any Github action, you\'re essentially giving the code in that action permission to do whatever it wants to your repository.  *Don\'t* just hand over your security tokens to any Github actions, for which the sources are not available!\n\nFor extra peace of mind, please review src/main.ts *in detail*; also, feel free to rebuild main.js using `npm run bundle`, to make sure that the minified main.js corresponds exactly to main.ts.\n\nAs an extra protection, src/main.ts tries to helpfully mark the token that you provide it as a secret, so that it doesn\'t inadvertently sneak into any log files.\n\n## problems?\n\nI welcome all reasonable patches and improvements as merge requests against [this repository](https://github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release).  If you can make the code better, please help me to do so!'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
502,"b'# github action maven release\n\nThe GitHub Action for Maven releases wraps the Maven CLI to enable Maven release.\nFor example, you can use this action for auto-incrementing your project version and release your java artifacts.\n\nThis github action is bot friendly: You can configure the credentials of a bot user, which would be used during the incremental commit.\nThe commits by the bot can also be signed, giving you the guaranty that only the bot can release in your repo. Additionally,\nthis give you a clean git history by highlighting nicely which commits where resulting from your CI.\n\n## Supporting this github action\n\nSupport this github action by staring this project. Surprisingly, it seems to be the only way for the github market place to highlight popular github actions.\n\n## Sample repository\n\nWe created a sample repository that will show you an example of how this github action can be used for releasing a Java application: \nhttps://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release-sample\n\n## Features\n\nObviously, this github actions uses maven release plugin. Although, we did add on top a few features that you may like.\n\nMaven release uses Git behind it, therefore there were a few features related in customising the git configuration:\n- Signing the commits (GPG) resulting from the maven release [[GPG](#setup-a-gpg-key)]\n- Authenticating to private repository using an SSH key [[SSH](#setup-with-ssh)]\n- Configuring the git username and email [[Bot](#customise-the-bot-name)]\n- Configuring the jdk version [[JDK](#jdk-version)]\n\nYou may want to configure a bit maven too. We added the following features:\n- Specify the maven project path. In other words, if your maven project is not at the root of your repo, you can configure a sub path. [[Custom project path](#customise-the-m2-folder-path)] \n- Configure private maven server repositories [[Private maven repo](#Setup-private-maven-server-repositories)]\n- Configure a docker registry [[Docker registry](#setup-a-docker-registry)]\n- Setup custom maven arguments and/or options to be used when calling maven commands [[Maven options](#maven-options)]\n- Configure a custom M2 folder [[Custom M2](#customise-the-m2-folder-path)]\n- Print the timestamp for every maven logs. Handy for troubleshooting performance issues in your CI. [[Log timestamp](#log-timestamp)]\n\nFor the maven releases, we got also some dedicated functionalities:\n- Skip the maven perform [[Skip perform](#skipping-perform)]\n- Roll back the maven perform if it failed to perform the release\n- Increment the major or minor version (by default, it\'s the patch version that is increased) [[Major Minor version](#increase-major-or-minor-version)]\n- customise the version format completly [[Customize version](#customize-version)]\n\n# Usage\n\n## Setup your pom.xml for maven release\n\nBefore you even begin setting up this github action, you would need to set up your pom.xml first to be ready for maven releases.\nWe recommend you to refer to the maven release plugin documentation for more details: https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/\n\nNevertheless, we will give you some essential setups\n\n### Configure the SCM\n\nYou got two choices here:\n- Using SSH URL (Recommended)\n```xml\n    <scm>\n        <connection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</connection>\n        <developerConnection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</developerConnection>\n        <url>git@github.com:idhub-io/idhub-api.git</url>\n        <tag>HEAD</tag>\n    </scm>\n```\n- Using HTTPS URL\n```xml\n\t<scm>\n        <connection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</connection>\n        <developerConnection>scm:git:${project.scm.url}</developerConnection>\n\t\t<url>https://github.com/YOUR_REPO.git</url>\n\t\t<tag>HEAD</tag>\n\t</scm>\n```\n\nIn the case of SSH, it will use the `ssh-private-key`  to authenticate with the upstream.\nIn the case of HTTPS, maven releases will use the `access-token` in this github actions to authenticate with the upstream.\n\nNote: SSH is more elegant and usually the easiest one to setup due to the large amount of documents online on this subject.\n\n### maven release plugin\n\nAdd the maven release plugin dependency to your project\n\n```xml\n    <plugin>\n        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>XXX</version>\n        <configuration>\n            <scmCommentPrefix>[ci skip]</scmCommentPrefix>\n        </configuration>\n    </plugin>\n```\n\nPersonally, I usually the prefix `[ci skip]` which allows me to skip more easily any commits generated by the bot from the CI.\n\n## Setup the maven release github actions\n\n### Choose your version of this github action\n\nIf it\'s your first time using a github action, I invite you having a quick read to the github official recommendations:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions\n\nIt\'s important you understand how the versioning work and the risk/compromise of using master/tags/commit hash\n\nIf you are adventurous and like to be always on top of this github action, you can use the reference *master* :\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master\n      with:\n```\n\nIf you are more reserve, you can use a tag instead. You can find the list of the tags for this github action here:\n\nhttps://github.com/qcastel/github-actions-maven-release/tags\n\nTo use a tag:\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@TAG_NAME\n      with:\n```\n\nIf you are concerned about the security of this github action, you can also move to a commit hash:\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@COMMIT_HASH\n      with:\n```\n\n\n\n### Basic setup\nFor a simple repo with not much protection and private dependency, you can do:\n\n```yaml\n      env:\n       JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/\n      with:\n       ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n```\n\nYou will need to follow the `Setup with SSH` section to setup the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` accordingly.\n\n### Setup with SSH\n\nAlthough you may found better to use a SSH key instead. For this, generate an SSH key with the method of your choice, or use an existing one.\nPersonally, I like generating an SSH inside a temporary docker image and configure it as a deploy key in my repository:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it qcastel/maven-release:latest  bash\n```\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /tmp/sshkey -q -N """"\nexport SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(base64 /tmp/sshkey)\nexport SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat /tmp/sshkey.pub)\necho -n ""Copy the following SSH private key and add it to your repo secrets under the name \'SSH_PRIVATE_KEY\':""\necho $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY\necho ""Copy the encoded SSH public key and add it as one of your repo deploy keys with write access:""\necho $SSH_PUBLIC_KEY\n\nexit \n```\n\nCopy `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and add it as a new secret.\n![img/Add-ssh-secrets.png](img/Add-ssh-secrets.png?raw=true)\n\nCopy `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` and add it as a new deployment key with write access.\n![img/add-deploy-key.png](img/add-deploy-key.png?raw=true)\n\nFinally, setup the github action with:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n```\n\nIf you want to set up a passphrase for your key:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n          ssh-passphrase: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSPHRASE }}\n```\n\n#### SSH known hosts\n\nThe current github actions support by default the following known hosts:\n\n- `github.com`\n- `gitlab.com`\n- `bitbucket.org`\n\nAlthough you may want to additional one, using the following properties:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n          ssh-extra-known-host: ""my-awesome-private-git-host.com""\n```\n\nYou can also disable the default hosts (for example, if you are behind a corporate proxy) like so:\n```yaml\n        with:\n          ssh-ignore-default-hosts: true\n```\n\n### log Timestamp\n\nIt can be quite difficult to troubleshoot any performance issue on your CI, due to the lack of timestamp from maven by default.\nAn example of it particular handy, is when you private maven repository is having performance issue that is affecting your CI.\n\nWe added the timestamp by default, you don\'t need to do anything particular to enable this feature.\n\nThe logs should look like:\n\n```\n14:27:09,491 [INFO] Downloading from spring-snapshots: https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/io/projectreactor/reactor-bom/Dysprosium-SR13/reactor-bom-Dysprosium-SR13.pom\n``` \n \n### Maven options\n\n#### Adding maven arguments\n\nYou can add some maven arguments, which is handy for skipping tests:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            maven-args: ""-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip""\n```\n\n#### Adding maven options\n\nYou can add some maven options. At the difference of the maven arguments, those one are explicitly for the maven release plugin.\nSee https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/prepare-mojo.html.\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            maven-options: ""-DbranchName=hotfix""\n```\n\n### JDK version\n\nThe default JDK version is JDK 17. Although you may want to compile your project with a specific JDK version. You will need to specify the JAVA_HOME variable with the according value.\nIf you need a specific jdk version that is not in the list, please raise an issue in this github action to request it.\n\n#### JDK 8\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/\n```\n\n#### JDK 11\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/\n```\n\n#### JDK 14\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-14-openjdk/\n```\n\n#### JDK 15\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-15-openjdk/\n```\n\n#### JDK 16\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-16-openjdk/\n```\n\n\n#### JDK 17\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/\n```\n\n\n### Customise the bot name\n\nYou can simply customise the bot name as follows:\n\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""\n            git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""\n```\n\n### Customise the default branch\nYou may not want to release from your master branch, which is currently the default branch setup by this github action. You can customise the branch name you want to release on, here `release`, as follows:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            release-branch-name: ""release""\n\n```\n\n### Skipping perform\nIf for a reason, you need to skip the maven release perfom, you can disable it as follow:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            skip-perform: true\n```\n\n\n### Increase major, minor or patch version\n\n#### For major version increment\n\n_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT_\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            version-major: true\n```\n\n#### For minor version increment\n\n_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT_\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            version-minor: true\n```\n\n#### For patch version increment\n\nAs the patch version is the default version number increased, you don\'t need to specify any additional properties.\n\nAlthough if you prefer to be explicit, you can use the following option:\n\n_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT_\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            version-patch: true\n```\n\n### Customize version\n\n#### development version\n\nYou may want to fully customize the development version number. This option will allow you to fully take control on the version number format.\n\nFor Example, you could decide to only have a 2 part version number like `0.2-SNAPSHOT`.\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            maven-development-version-number: ${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.\\${parsedVersion.nextMinorVersion}-SNAPSHOT\n```\n\n### Release version\n\nYou may want to fully customize the release version number. This option will allow you to fully take control on the version number format.\n\nFor Example, you could decide to only have a trailing 0 for releases like `0.2.0`.\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            maven-release-version-number: ${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.\\${parsedVersion.minorVersion}.0\n```\n\n\n#### Customise the M2 folder path\n\nIt\'s quite common for setting up a caching of your dependencies, that you will be interested to customise the .m2 localisation folder.\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            m2-home-folder: \'/your-custom-path/.m2\'\n```\n\n\n### Setup a GPG key\nIf you want to set up a GPG key, you can do it by injecting your key via the secrets:\n\nNote: `GITHUB_GPG_KEY` needs to be base64 encoded.\nif you haven\'t setup a GPG key yet, see next section.\n\n```yaml\n      with:\n        gpg-enabled: ""true""\n        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}\n        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}\n```\n\nIn case you want to skip the GPG step, you can set `gpg-enabled: ""false""` or if you prefer to have the same behaviour in your IDE, add this maven plugin in your `pom.xml` to skip GPG step in the release phase:\n\n```xml\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-gpg-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>1.6</version>\n    <configuration>\n        <skip>true</skip>\n    </configuration>\n</plugin>\n```\n\n### Setup private maven server repositories\n\nIf you got a private maven repo to set up in the settings.xml, you can do:\nNote: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.\n\n```yaml\n      with:\n        maven-servers: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_SERVERS }}\n```\n\nGithub actions currently don\'t support arrays input format.\nThis is why we choose to request the secret `MVN_REPO_SERVERS` to be a JSON containing the servers definition. Example:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    ""id"": ""serverId1"",\n    ""username"": ""username"",\n    ""password"": ""password1"",\n    ""privateKey"": ""privatekey1"",\n    ""passphrase"": ""passphrase1""\n  },\n  {\n    ""id"": ""serverId2"",\n    ""username"": ""username2"",\n    ""password"": ""password2""\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou will need to put the JSON in one line:\n```bash\nMVN_REPO_SERVERS=\'[{""id"": ""serverId1"", ""username"": ""username"", ""password"": ""password1"", ""privateKey"": ""privatekey1"", ""passphrase"": ""passphrase1""}, {""id"": ""serverId2"", ""username"": ""username2"", ""password"": ""password2""}]\'\n```\n\n### Setup a docker registry\n\nIf you got a private maven repo to set up in the settings.xml, you can do:\nNote: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.\n\n```yaml\n      with:\n        docker-registry-id: your-docker-registry-id\n        docker-registry-username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME }}\n        docker-registry-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\nNote: For docker hub, this would look like:\n```yaml\n      with:\n        docker-registry-id: registry.hub.docker.com\n        docker-registry-username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}\n        docker-registry-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\n### Configure your maven project\n\nYou may also be in the case where you got more than one maven projects inside the repo. We added an option that will make the release job move to the according directly before running the release:\n\n```yaml\n    with:\n        maven-project-folder: ""sub-folder/""\n```\n\n\n## Setup the bot gpg key\n\nSetting up a gpg key for your bot is a good security feature. This way, you can enforce sign commits in your repo,\neven for your release bot.\n\n![Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9F6cxpqm/Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png)\n\n- Create dedicate github account for your bot and add him into your team for your git repo.\n- Create a new GPG key: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key\n\nThis github action needs the key ID and the key base64 encoded.\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            gpg-enabled: true\n            gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY_ID }}\n            gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY }}\n```\n\nIf you want to set up a passphrase:\n\n```yaml\n        with:\n            gpg-enabled: true\n            gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY_ID }}\n            gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY }}\n            gpg-passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }} \n```\n\n### Generate the key\n\nf you like how we created a SSH key pair, here is the same idea using a docker image to generate a GPG key:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it qcastel/maven-release:latest  bash\n```\n\n```bash\ncat >genkey-batch <<EOF\n %no-protection\n Key-Type: default\n Subkey-Type: default\n Name-Real: bot\n Name-Email: bot@idhub.io\n Expire-Date: 0\nEOF\ngpg --batch --gen-key genkey-batch\n```\n\nNote: Don\'t exit the docker container as we are not done yet.\n\n\n### Get the KID\n\nYou can get the key ID doing the following:\n\n```bash\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG\n\nsec   rsa2048/3EFC3104C0088B08 2019-11-28 [SC]\n      CBFD9020DAC388A77C68385C3EFC3104C0088B08\nuid                 [ultimate] bot-openbanking4-dev (it\'s the bot openbanking4.dev key) <bot@openbanking4.dev>\nssb   rsa2048/7D1523C9952204C1 2019-11-28 [E]\n\n```\nThe key ID for my bot is 3EFC3104C0088B08. Add this value into your github secret for this repo, under `GPG_KEY_ID`\nPS: the key id is not really a secret but we found more elegant to store it there than in plain text in the github action yml\n\n### Get the GPG public and private key\n\nNow we need the raw key and base64 encode\n```bash\n\necho \'Public key to add in your bot github account:\'\ngpg --armor --export FFD651809B1889DF\necho \'Private key to add to the CI secrets under GITHUB_GPG_KEY:\'\ngpg --export-secret-keys --armor FFD651809B1889DF | base64\n\nexit\n```\n\nCopy the public key and import it to the bot account as a GPG key.\nCopy the private key and add it in your github repo secrets under `GPG_KEY`.\n\n\n# License\nThe Dockerfile and associated scripts and documentation in this project are release under the MIT License.\n\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***\n\nIf `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner\'s temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Publishing using Gradle\n```yaml\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up JDK 1.8\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v1\n\n    - name: Build with Gradle\n      run: gradle build\n\n    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages\n      run: gradle publish\n      env:\n        USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.\n\n## Apache Maven with a settings path\n\nWhen using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file.

By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you\'re reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.7+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install ""black[jupyter]""`.\n\nIf you can\'t wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn\'t work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to the\n[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you\'re feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn\'t\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They\'re both worth taking a look:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you\'re looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you\'re asking yourself ""Do I need to configure anything?"" the answer is\n""No"". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,\nQuora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):\n\n> I can\'t think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don\'t have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn\'t suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nand [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code.

[License](#License)\n\n## Overview\n\n`setup-ros` sets up an environment so that:\n\n- [ROS 2 latest development branch][ros2_latest_development_setup] builds from source,\n- non-EOL (End Of Life) distribution of ROS 2 builds from source,\n- any ROS, and ROS 2 package depending on non-EOL distribution builds from source\n\nThe action will not install ROS, or ROS 2, by default.\nTo install a ROS binary distribution, pass a value to `required-ros-distributions` (see example below).\n\n:warning: `apt-get update` is flaky on bare metal GitHub actions Linux workers relying on the GitHub APT mirrors.\nIt is recommended to run `setup-ros` in a Docker container.\nSee [`jobs.<job_id>.container` documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer).\nAn alternative approach is to edit APT sources on the bare metal worker (see [#80](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros/issues/80) for details).\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nThis GitHub action aims for strict [REP-3] and [REP-2000] compliance.\n`setup-ros` supports all non-EOL ROS distributions, on all Tier-1 platforms.\nIn particular, this action supports Ubuntu, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nFor macOS, and Microsoft Windows, the OS version specified in the REPs may not be available as a [GitHub Hosted runners][github_hosted_runners].\nIn this case, this GitHub action CI runs the closest available worker environment.\n\nUsers requiring exact REP compliance should run the action on a [self-hosted runner][self_hosted_runner].\n\nThis problem does not apply to Linux workers, where Docker can ensure that the action runs the Linux distribution specified by the REPs.\n\n## Tasks performed by the action\n\n`setup-ros` installs the following command-line tools:\n\n- `colcon`\n- `rosdep`\n- `vcs`\n\nIt also performs the following actions:\n\n- On Ubuntu:\n  - Setting the locale to `en_US.UTF-8` and, the timezone to UTC\n  - GCC and clang default APT packages\n  - Registering the Open Robotics APT repository\n  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using APT\n- On macOS:\n  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Homebrew] and [pip]\n- On Microsoft Windows:\n  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Chocolatey]\n\nThe dependencies installed by this package include ROS 2 DDS vendor packages, such as Eclipse Cyclone DDS, eProsima Fast DDS, and RTI Connext DDS.\nSee [`src/package_manager/*.ts`](./src/package_manager/) for the complete list.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml).\n\n`setup-ros` is under active development, and compatibility between releases is not yet guaranteed.\nPlease do not use `ros-tooling/setup-ros@master`.\nInstead, pin your workflows to a particular release, e.g.: `ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7`.\n\n### Setting up the worker, and installing the system dependencies\n\nThe default behavior is to only install development tools.\nNo ROS binary distribution is installed in this case.\nThis setup should be used when ROS is built entirely from source.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n  - run: vcs --help\n```\n\n### Setting up the worker, and installing system dependencies on all OSes\n\nIt is possible to iterate on macOS and Windows from the same job (`build`).\nUbuntu requires its own separate workflow as additional configuration is required for Docker.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [macOS-latest, windows-latest]\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup ROS\n        uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n      - run: vcs --help\n\n  build_docker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      image: ubuntu:jammy\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup ROS\n        uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n      - run: vcs --help\n```\n\n### Setting up the worker, installing system dependencies and ROS (Linux)\n\nOne or more ROS distributions can be installed simultaneously by passing multiple values to `required-ros-distributions`.\nThis setup is necessary to use the ROS 1/ROS 2 bridge: [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge).\n\n```yaml\nbuild_docker:\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  container:\n    image: ubuntu:jammy\n  steps:\n    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n      with:\n        required-ros-distributions: noetic humble\n    - run: ""source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && ros2 run --help""\n    - run: ""source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash && rosnode --help""\n```\n\n**Note: on Ubuntu, `required-ros-distributions` installs the desktop variant for that distribution. This option is not required, and should probably be avoided in most workflows. It is retained for historical reasons and those who specifically do not care about whether their application specifies its dependencies properly.**\n\n### Use pre-release ROS 2 binaries for testing\n\nYou can specify if you\'d like to use the [pre-release ROS 2 repository][pre_release_testing] in your sources list file by setting the `use-ros2-testing` parameter to `true`.\n\n```yaml\nbuild_docker:\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  container:\n    image: ubuntu:jammy\n  steps:\n    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n      with:\n        use-ros2-testing: true\n        required-ros-distributions: humble\n```\n\n### Including RTI Connext\n\nBy default this action will not install RTI Connext as it requires acceptance of a non-commerical license.\nThe license agreement should be reviewed by users on their own before accepting it.\nTo include RTI Connext, simply set the `install-connext` parameter to `true`.\n\n```yaml\nbuild_docker:\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  container:\n    image: ubuntu:jammy\n  steps:\n    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n      with:\n        install-connext: true\n        use-ros2-testing: true\n        required-ros-distributions: humble\n```\n\n### Iterating on all ROS distributions, for all platforms\n\nThis workflow illustrates how to spawn one job per ROS release, for every supported platform.\n\nThe workflow `test` is iterating on all ROS 2 distributions, on macOS, and Windows.\n\nThe workflow `test_docker` is iterating on all ROS and ROS 2 distributions, for all supported Ubuntu distributions, using Docker.\nThe test matrix associates each distribution with one Docker image.\nThis is required to ensure that the appropriate Ubuntu container is used.\nFor example, Noetic requires `focal`, Humble requires `jammy`, etc.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test: # Docker is not supported on macOS and Windows.\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [macOS-latest, windows-latest]\n        ros_distribution: # Only include ROS 2 distributions, as ROS 1 does not support macOS and Windows.\n          - humble\n          - iron\n    steps:\n      - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.7\n        with:\n          required-ros-distributions: ${{ matrix.ros_distribution }}\n      - name: build and test\n        uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.2\n        with:\n          package-name: YOUR_PACKAGE_HERE MORE_PACKAGES_HERE\n          target-ros2-distro: ${{ matrix.ros_distribution }}\n\n  test_docker: # On Linux, iterates on all ROS 1 and ROS 2 distributions.\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        ros_distribution:\n          - noetic\n          - humble\n          - iron\n\n        # Define the Docker image(s) associated with each ROS distribution.\n        # The include syntax allows additional variables to be defined, like\n        # docker_image in this case.

[License](#License)\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis action requires the following ROS development tools to be installed (and initialized if applicable) on the CI worker instance:\n\n```\ncolcon-common-extensions\ncolcon-lcov-result  # Optional\ncolcon-coveragepy-result\ncolcon-mixin\nrosdep\nvcstool\n```\n\nOn Linux, the setup can be done through [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros), or by running the action in a Docker image containing the appropriate binaries.\n\n**Note**: for Windows, `action-ros-ci` currently needs to be run on `windows-2019` or needs another action to install Visual Studio 2019.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe action first assembles a workspace, then runs `colcon build`, and `colcon test` in it.\n\nThe workspace is built by running:\n\n- `vcs import` on the repo file(s) specified through the `vcs-repo-file-url` argument, if any (defaults to none)\n- checkout the code under test in the workspace using `vcs`\n- `rosdep install` for the workspace, to get its dependencies\n- run `colcon build` (optionally limited to packages specified in `package-name`)\n- run `colcon test` (optionally limited to packages specified in `package-name`; optionally [skipped](#Skip-tests))\n\nThis action requires targeting a ROS or ROS 2 distribution explicitly.\nThis is provided via the `target-ros1-distro` or `target-ros2-distro` inputs, respectively.\nEither or both may be specified, if neither is provided an error will be raised.\nThis input is used to `source setup.sh` for any installed ROS binaries (e.g. installed using [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros)), as well as used as an argument to `rosdep install`.\n\n## Action Output\n\nThis action defines [an output variable](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs): `ros-workspace-directory-name`.\nIt contains the path to the root of the ROS workspace assembled by the action.\n\nThe variable value should be used to retrieve logs, binaries, etc. after the action completes.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [`action.yml`](action.yml) to get the list of inputs supported by this action.\n\n[action-ros-ci-template](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci-template) offers a template for using `action-ros-ci`.\n\n### Build and run tests for your ROS 2 package\n\nHere are the two simplest use-cases.\n\n#### Using dependencies from binaries\n\nIn this case, `action-ros-ci` will rely on `setup-ros` for installing ROS 2 binaries.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n```\n\n#### Building ROS 2 dependencies from source\n\nIn this case, `action-ros-ci` will build all necessary ROS 2 dependencies of `my_package` from source.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      vcs-repo-file-url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/humble/ros2.repos\n```\n\n### Schedule an action on a specific branch\n\nIf you want to continue supporting older ROS releases while developing on an the main branch use `acton-ros-ci` with `ref` on a scheduled job.\nWithout setting ref the default branch and most recent commit will be used.\n\n```yaml\nname: Humble Source Build\non:\n  schedule:\n    # At 00:00 on Sunday.\n    - cron \'0 0 * * 0\'\n\njobs:\n  humble_source:\n    runs_on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n        with:\n          required-ros-distributions: humble\n      - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n        with:\n          package-name: my_package\n          ref: humble\n          target-ros2-distro: humble\n          vcs-repo-file-url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/humble/ros2.repos\n```\n\n### Build with a custom `repos` or `rosinstall` file\n\nYou can specify your own repos file using the `vcs-repo-file-url` input.\nYou can also automatically generate your package\'s dependencies using the following workflow:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n  # Run the generator and output the results to a file.\n  - run: |\n      rosinstall_generator <package-name> --rosdistro <target-distro> \\\n      --deps-only --deps --upstream-development > /tmp/deps.repos\n  # Pass the file to the action\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      vcs-repo-file-url: /tmp/deps.repos\n```\n\nNote that the `actions/checkout` step is required when using a custom repos file from your repository.\n\n### Build a ROS 1 workspace\n\nBuilding a ROS 1 workspace works the same way.\nSimply use `target-ros1-distro` instead of `target-ros2-distro`.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: noetic\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros1-distro: noetic\n```\n\n### Skip tests\n\nTo skip tests and code coverage data processing, set the `skip-tests` option to `true`.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      skip-tests: true\n```\n\n### Use a `colcon` `defaults.yaml` file\n\nTo use a [`colcon` `defaults.yaml` file](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html#defaults-yaml), provide a valid JSON string through the `colcon-defaults` input.\nThis allows using a `colcon` option/argument that is not exposed by this action\'s inputs.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      colcon-defaults: |\n        {\n          ""build"": {\n            ""cmake-args"": [\n                ""-DMY_CUSTOM_OPTION=ON""\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n```\n\n### Enable Address Sanitizer to automatically report memory issues\n\n[ASan][addresssanitizer] is an open-source tool developed to automatically report\nmemory corruption bugs.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      colcon-defaults: |\n        {\n          ""build"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""asan-gcc""]\n          }\n        }\n      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/3e627e0fa30db85aea05a50e2c61a9832664d236/index.yaml\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n```\n\nTo look for detected memory errors, check the build logs for entries containing `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`. Example:\n\n```\n==9442== ERROR: AddressSanitizer heap-use-after-free on address 0x7f7ddab8c084 at pc 0x403c8c bp 0x7fff87fb82d0 sp 0x7fff87fb82c8\n```\n\nASan is analyzing memory issues at runtime. ASan diagnostic messages will be emitted by the package tests when they run.\n\n### Generate and process code coverage data\n\n#### Generate code coverage information using `lcov` and `colcon-lcov-result`\n\nGenerate code coverage information for C/C++ files using the appropriate mixins for `gcc`.\n`action-ros-ci` uses [`colcon-lcov-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-lcov-result) to aggregate generated coverage information.\n\nFlags can be passed manually using, for instance, `extra-cmake-args`, but it is\npreferable to use a `colcon` mixin (through [`colcon-defaults`](#Use-a-colcon-defaultsyaml-file)) to pass the appropriate flags automatically.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      colcon-defaults: |\n        {\n          ""build"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""coverage-gcc""]\n          }\n        }\n      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid\n      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.\n      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/1ddb69bedfd1f04c2f000e95452f7c24a4d6176b/index.yaml\n```\n\n#### Generate code coverage information using `coveragepy` and `colcon-coveragepy-result`\n\nGenerate code coverage information for Python files using the appropriate mixins.\n`action-ros-ci` uses [`colcon-coveragepy-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-coveragepy-result) to aggregate generated coverage information.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      colcon-defaults: |\n        {\n          ""build"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""coverage-pytest""]\n          },\n          ""test"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""coverage-pytest""]\n          }\n        }\n      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid\n      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.\n      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/1ddb69bedfd1f04c2f000e95452f7c24a4d6176b/index.yaml\n```\n\n#### Integrate `action-ros-ci` with `codecov`\n\nThe generated code coverage information can be uploaded to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/).\n\nFor a private repo, you will need to setup a secret `CODECOV_TOKEN` in [your repository settings][creating-encrypted-secrets].\nSee [`codecov/codecov-action`](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) documentation for more information about how to setup the action.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6\n    with:\n      required-ros-distributions: humble\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n      colcon-defaults: |\n        {\n          ""build"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""coverage-gcc"", ""coverage-pytest""]\n          },\n          ""test"": {\n            ""mixin"": [""coverage-pytest""]\n          }\n        }\n      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid\n      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.\n      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/1ddb69bedfd1f04c2f000e95452f7c24a4d6176b/index.yaml\n  - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1.2.1\n    with:\n      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # only needed for private repos\n      files: ros_ws/lcov/total_coverage.info,ros_ws/coveragepy/.coverage\n      flags: unittests\n      name: codecov-umbrella\n```\n\nYou will also need to add a [`codecov.yml` configuration file](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecovyml-reference) (at the root of your repo):\n\n```yaml\nfixes:\n  # For each package in your repo\n  - ""ros_ws/src/*/my_repo/my_package/::""\n```\n\nThe configuration file is required to let codecov map the workspace directory structure to the Git repository structure, and setup the links between codecov and GitHub properly.\nNote here that `actions/checkout` is required because `codecov/codecov-action` needs the `codecov.yml` file.\n\n### Store `colcon` logs as build artifacts\n\nGitHub workflows can persist data generated in workers during the build using [artifacts](persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts). `action-ros-ci` generated colcon logs can be saved as follows:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  # ...\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    id: action_ros_ci_step\n    with:\n      package-name: ament_copyright\n      target-ros2-distro: humble\n  - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1\n    with:\n      name: colcon-logs\n      path: ${{ steps.action_ros_ci_step.outputs.ros-workspace-directory-name }}/log\n    if: always() # upload the logs even when the build fails\n```\n\n### Use with private repos\n\n`action-ros-ci` needs a token to be able to clone private repositories.\nIf the only private repository your workflow needs is the one against which it runs, using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will work.\nHowever, if your workflow also clones other private repositories (e.g., repositories included in repos files provided through `vcs-repo-file-url`), you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (PAT) with the ""repo"" scope and add it to your repo\'s [secrets][creating-encrypted-secrets].\nFor example, if this secret is called `REPO_TOKEN`:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  # ...\n  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.3\n    with:\n      package-name: my_package\n      # If there are no private dependencies, no need to create a PAT or add a secret\n      import-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      # If there are private dependencies (e.g., in a file provided through vcs-repo-file-url), a PAT is required\n      import-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n      # ...\n```\n\n### Interdependent pull requests or merge requests\n\nThis action allows declaring PR dependencies by providing:\n* repos file(s) to override the one(s) defined through the `vcs-repo-file-url` action input\n* supplemental repos file(s) to be used along with the rest\n\nFor example, this may be useful when your PR depends on PRs/MRs/branches from other repos for it to work or be properly tested.\n\nInclude links in your PR\'s description using the following format:\n\n```\naction-ros-ci-repos-override: https://gist.github.com/some-user/some.repos\naction-ros-ci-repos-override: https://gist.github.com/some-user/some-other.repos\naction-ros-ci-repos-supplemental: https://gist.github.com/some-user/some-supplemental.repos\naction-ros-ci-repos-supplemental: file://path/to/some/other/supplemental.repos\n```\n\n## Developing\n\nFor developing and releasing `action-ros-ci`, see [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md).\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [Apache 2](LICENSE) license.\n\n[creating-encrypted-secrets]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets\n[persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts\n[addresssanitizer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Action, ensure security of your workflows. GitHub\nSecurity Lab provides more\n[detailed](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)\noverview of these risks involved in using `pull_request_target` and\n`workflow_run` triggers, as well as recommendations on how to avoid these risks.\n\nRecommended setup differs between public and private repositories, however the\nAction can be used in other combinations as well.\n\n### Public repositories\n\nUsing a `workflow_run` trigger allows to provide the Merge Me! Action with\nnecessary credentials, while allowing the CI to keep using `pull_request`\ntrigger, which is safer than `pull_request_target`.\n\nCreate a new `.github/workflows/merge-me.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\nname: Merge me!\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    types:\n      - completed\n    workflows:\n      # List all required workflow names here.\n      - 'Continuous Integration'\n\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    name: Merge me!\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - # It is often a desired behavior to merge only when a workflow execution\n        # succeeds. This can be changed as needed.\n        if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}\n        name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          # Depending on branch protection rules, a  manually populated\n          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_WORKAROUND` secret with permissions to push to\n          # a protected branch must be used. This secret can have an arbitrary\n          # name, as an example, this repository uses `DOTTBOTT_TOKEN`.\n          #\n          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following\n          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:\n          #\n          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support pushing\n          # to protected branches.\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nTriggering on `check_suite` is similar:\n\n```yaml\nname: Merge me!\n\non:\n  check_suite:\n    types:\n      - completed\n\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    name: Merge me!\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Private repositories\n\nPrivate repositories are less prone attacks, as only a restricted set of\naccounts has access to them. At the same time, CIs in private repositories often\nrequire access to secrets for other purposes as well, such as installing private\ndependencies. For these reasons, it is recommended to use `pull_request_target`\ntrigger, which allows to combine regular CI checks and the Merge Me! Action into\none workflow:\n\n```yaml\nname: Continuous Integration\n\non:\n  # Trigger on Pull Requests against the master branch.\n  pull_request_target:\n    branches:\n      - master\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - synchronize\n  # Trigger on Pull Requests to the master branch.\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  # Add other CI jobs, such as testing and linting. The example test job\n  # showcases checkout settings which support `pull_request_target` and `push`\n  # triggers at the same time.\n  test:\n    name: Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          # This adds support for both `pull_request_target` and `push` events.\n          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}\n      - name: Setup Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: 16\n          registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com\n      - # This allows private dependencies from GitHub Packages to be installed.\n        # Depending on the setup, it might be required to use a personal access\n        # token instead.\n        env:\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-progress\n      - name: Test\n        run: npm run test\n  merge-me:\n    name: Merge me!\n    needs:\n      # List all required job names here.\n      - test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          # Depending on branch protection rules, a  manually populated\n          # `GITHUB_TOKEN_WORKAROUND` secret with permissions to push to\n          # a protected branch must be used. This secret can have an arbitrary\n          # name, as an example, this repository uses `DOTTBOTT_TOKEN`.\n          #\n          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following\n          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:\n          #\n          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support pushing\n          # to protected branches.\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    timeout-minutes: 5\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Enable auto-merge for a different bot\n\nYou may have another bot that also creates PRs against your repository and you\nwant to automatically merge those. By default, this GitHub Action assumes the\nbot is [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot). You can override the bot\nname by changing the value of `GITHUB_LOGIN` parameter:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_LOGIN: my-awesome-bot-r2d2\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nA common scenario is to use Dependabot Preview (consider updating instead):\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_LOGIN: dependabot-preview\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n`GITHUB_LOGIN` option supports\n[micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\n\n### Opting in for using GitHub preview APIs\n\nYou may opt-in for using GitHub preview APIs, which enables the action to\nrespect strict branch protection rules configured for the repository\n(`Require status checks to pass before merging` and\n`Require branches to be up to date before merging` options).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          ENABLE_GITHUB_API_PREVIEW: true\n```\n\n### Use of configurable pull request merge method\n\nBy default, this GitHub Action assumes merge method is `SQUASH`. You can\noverride the merge method by changing the value of `MERGE_METHOD` parameter (one\nof `MERGE`, `SQUASH` or `REBASE`):\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          MERGE_METHOD: MERGE\n```\n\n### Presets\n\nPresets enable additional functionality which can be used to better personalize\ndefault behavior of the Merge me! Action.\n\nAvailable presets are:\n\n- `DEPENDABOT_MINOR` - Merge only minor and patch dependency updates for pull\n  requests created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows\n  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).\n- `DEPENDABOT_PATCH` - Merge only patch dependency updates for pull requests\n  created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows\n  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          PRESET: DEPENDABOT_PATCH\n```\n\n### Number of retries\n\nIn case the merge action fails, by default it will automatically be retried up\nto three times using an exponential backoff strategy. This means, the first\nretry will happen 1 second after the first failure, while the second will happen\n4 seconds after the previous, the third 9 seconds, and so on.\n\nIt's possible to configure the number of retries by providing a value for\n`MAXIMUM_RETRIES` (by default, the value is `3`).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          MAXIMUM_RETRIES: 2\n```\n\n### Enable for manual changes\n\nThere are cases in which manual changes are needed, for instance, in order to\nmake the CI pass or to solve some conflicts that Dependabot (or the bot you are\nusing) cannot handle. By default, this GitHub action will skip this case where\nthe author is not [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot) (or the bot you\nare using). This is often desirable as the author might prefer to get a code\nreview before merging the changes. For this, it checks whether all commits were\nmade by the original author and that the commit signature is valid.\n\nIt is possible to override this default behavior by setting the value of\n`ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES` to `'true'`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES: 'true'\n```\n\n> Important: Please note the single quotes around `true`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your\nlocal machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to\nconsume this package in your project.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMinimal requirements to set up the project:\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v14, installation instructions can be found\n  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use\n  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be\n  installed in a\n  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).\n- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the\n  documentation will follow the npm syntax.\n- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.\n\n### Installing\n\nStart by cloning the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:ridedott/merge-me-action.git\n```\n\nIn case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by\nusing\n[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action/archive/master.zip) and\nextracting the downloaded archive.\n\nGo the the right directory and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd merge-me-action\nnpm install\n```\n\nThat's it! You can now go to the next step.\n\n## Testing\n\nAll tests are being executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). All tests files\nlive side-to-side with a source code and have a common suffix: `.spec.ts`. Some\nhelper methods are being stored in the `test` directory.\n\nThere are three helper scripts to run tests in the most common scenarios:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\nnpm run test:watch\nnpm run test:coverage\n```\n\n## Formatting\n\nThis project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All\nsupported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one\nof the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:\n\n```bash\nnpm run format\nnpm run format:fix\n```\n\n## Linting\n\nThis project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.\nTypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc). You can\nuse one of the following scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the\nfiles:\n\n```bash\nnpm run lint\nnpm run lint:fix\n```\n\n## Publishing\n\nPublishing is handled in an automated way and must not be performed manually.\n\nEach commit to the master branch is automatically tagged using\n[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Built with\n\n### Automation\n\n- [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/)\n- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\n\n### Source\n\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) v2.\n""","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

518,"b'> Note: This project has been replaced by https://github.com/woocommerce/automations\n\n# Project management automation\n\nThis is a [GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions) which contains various automations to assist with project management in a Github repository.\n\n## Available Automations\n\n- `todos`: Parses for `@todo` or `@TODO` comments in code and adds as inline review comments for reviews on pull request, and creates issues for each one if they exist when a pull is merged.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nTo use the action, include it in your workflow configuration file:\n\n```yaml\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  pull-request-automation:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: WordPress/gutenberg/packages/project-management-automation@v1\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          # This can be a comma delimited list of automations to run, in this case we\'re just executing todos\n          automations: todos\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Inputs\n\n- `github_token`: Required. GitHub API token to use for making API requests. This should be stored as a secret in the GitHub repository.\n- `automations`: Optional. You can include a comma-delimited list of specific automations you want to run if you don\'t want to use them all in a given workflow.\n\n### Outputs\n\n_None._\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis will be expanded, but for reference:\n\n### Developing\n\n- Clone the repo and then `npm install`.\n\n### Builds and releases\n\n- All pushes to master will automatically build the `dist/index.js` file for the action (then commit and push to master). So no need to worry about builds.\n- For releases, make sure you update the examples in the `README.md` if releasing a major version, otherwise just create a release manually (in the future this may get automated for releases).\n\n### Adding a new automation.\n\nThe design of this repository is setup so that automations can be their own discrete thing (eg. ""todos"") but still take advantage of various scaffolding and boilerplate when creating a new automation. The following is a rough list of steps to take to create and add a new automation:\n\n- Create a new directory in `lib/automations` that is the name of your automation.\n- Your `lib/automations` directory must at a minimum export the following from the `index.js` file in the directory:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // the name of your automation\n  name: \'my-automation\',\n  // what github action workflow events your automation reacts to.\n  events: [ \'pull_request\' ],\n  // what github action workflow event actions your automation reacts to.\n  actions: [ \'opened\' ],\n  // the runner for your automation.\n  runner\n}\n```\n- As noted above, this export must include a `runner` for your automation. The runner is an async function that will receive two arguments: `context` (which is the GitHub action context value) and `octokit` (which is the GitHub api helper). See more about these two arguments [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/github) (they are essentially what gets exposed by the `@actions/github` package). You can use the [`todos` runner as an example](https://github.com/nerrad/automations/blob/master/lib/automations/todos/runner.js).\n- Finally, in [`lib/automations.js`](https://github.com/nerrad/automations/blob/master/lib/automations.js), makes sure you import your automation configuration into this file and add it to the `moduleNames` array. So for example, if your automation was setup in `lib/automations/my-automation`, you would have something like this in the file after your changes:\n\n```js\n  \nconst todos = require( \'./automations/todos\' );\nconst myAutomation = require( \'./automations/my-automation\' );\n\nconst moduleNames = [ todos, myAutomation ];\n\n/**\n * @typedef {import(\'./typedefs\').AutomationTask} AutomationTask\n */\n\n/**\n * @type {AutomationTask[]}\n */\nconst automations = moduleNames.map( ( module ) => module );\n\nmodule.exports = automations;\n```\n\n- make sure you list your automation name and a brief description of what it does in the **Available Automations** section of this readme file.\n\nThat\'s it!\n\nDon\'t forget to add tests for your automation. There are various helpers available for mocking the `context` and `octokit` values (you can view the various todos automation tests for examples).\n\n\n## Credits\n\n- Thanks to the work of the [Gutenberg team](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) (particularly [@aduth](https://github.com/aduth)) in providing some inspiration for this approach to bundling various automations together.\n- The `todos` automation was inspired by this [todo probot app](https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo). Initial iterations of this action borrowed heavily from the ideas in this app.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The action works by running the following commands in shell via NodeJS:-\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n2. [Important Note](#important-note)\n3.

[Just Login](#just-login)\n10. [Important Notes](#important-notes)\n11. [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started using the action, just make sure to have a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#define-a-procfile) or a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) in your project and then create a folder called **.github** and inside it, create another folder called **workflows**. Finally inside the workflows folder, create a file called **main.yml** with the following contents:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n```\n\nNow go to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings. Scroll to the bottom until you see API Key. Copy this key and go to your project\'s repository on GitHub.\n\nIn your Repo, go to Settings -> Secrets and click on ""New Secret"". Then enter HEROKU_API_KEY as the name and paste the copied API Key as the value.\n\nYou can now push your project to GitHub and it will be automatically deployed to Heroku henceforth.\n\nYou learn more about GitHub Secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) and GitHub Actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)\n\n## Important Note\n\n**Please Note**: Git has recently announced that it is planning to switch the default branch\'s name from ""**master**"" to ""**main**"". For this reason, the Action also pushes to the ""**main**"" branch in the heroku origin by default and if your Heroku App is still using the ""**master**"" branch, then the Action will automatically switch your Heroku remote to use ""**main**"" as the default branch. There is **No Action Needed** from you, just keep in mind that this change is occurring as you continue to use the App and if you ever need to manually deploy the App, you can do so using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit push heroku YOUR_BRANCH:refs/heads/main\n```\n\nAlso the `remote_branch` property no longer exists in the latest release of the Action. If you still have this as part of the `3.10.9` release. Please remove it as it may cause problems in your workflow\n\n**Please Note**: While creating a new project on Heroku, **do not** enable the option for **Automatic Deployments** as this would result in an error when the GitHub Action is triggered.\n\n## Options\n\nThe action comes with additional options that you can use to configure your project\'s behavior on Heroku.

To use this feature, simply add a Dockerfile to your project and add a `CMD` command at the end of the Dockerfile. This is the command used by heroku to start the webserver inside the container. Finally make sure to set the `usedocker` flag to true before deploying.\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          usedocker: true\n```\n\nKeep in mind that if you deploy once using docker, the same heroku app is not compatible with a non-docker setup and similarly, you cannot deploy a dockerized setup to a non-docker heroku app.\n\nIf you need to pass in any ARGs for the Docker build, you may provide a list of arg names which automatically pull from the environment.\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          usedocker: true\n          docker_build_args: |\n            NODE_ENV\n            SECRET_KEY\n        env:\n          NODE_ENV: production\n          SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_KEY }}\n```\n\nAlso, thanks to [Olav Sundf\xc3\xb8r](https://github.com/olaven) for adding the Docker feature and [Matt Stavola](https://github.com/mbStavola) for adding the ability to pass in build args.\n\n### Deploy with custom Buildpacks\n\nTaken from the official heroku website:\n\n""Heroku Buildpacks are sets of open source scripts that are used for compiling apps on Heroku. They form the backbone of Heroku\xe2\x80\x99s [polyglot platform](https://www.heroku.com/languages). Buildpacks enable you to extend Heroku\'s build system to support your language or customizations, or to make particular binary packages available to the runtime. Heroku Buildpacks give you the freedom to code in the languages and frameworks that work best for your app and your team""\n\nTo use a custom buildpack in the action, simply add the url of the buildpack to the action:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          buildpack: ""https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git""\n```\n\n### Deploy Subdirectory\n\nIf you are using a complex application which has both frontend and backend applications in separate folders, you can specify a path to the directory to deploy using the **appdir** option:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          appdir: ""api"" # <- This will point to the api folder in your project\n```\n\nThanks to [meszarosdezso](https://github.com/meszarosdezso) for adding the appdir feature\n\n### Deploy custom branch\n\nYou can use the **branch** option to deploy an app in another branch\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          branch: ""dev""\n```\n\nThough this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information\n\n### Deploy custom remote branch\n\nYou can use the **remote_branch** option to deploy an app to another remote branch\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          remote_branch: ""main""\n```\n\nThough this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information\n\n### Set stack for your app\n\nIn some cases, you need to change the default stack - heroku-20.\nFor example, If you are building docker images with heroku yml, you need to change the stack to container.\nYou can use the **stack** option to change stack for your app.\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          stack: ""container""\n```\n\nThough this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information\n\n## Health Check\n\nSometimes you will run into issues where the action has successfully deployed the project but because of some error in code or the like, the Heroku App crashes or fails to launch. To counter this, you can setup a healthcheck in the action:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          healthcheck: ""https://[YOUR APP\'s NAME].herokuapp.com/health""\n```\n\nAdding the url to the healthcheck option of the action will make the action attempt to perform a GET Request to that url and print the response if successful. Else it will fail the action to indicate that the deploy was not successful.\n\nP.S: It is recommended that you setup a specific route such as **/health** for performing healthchecks\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nAdditionally, if you are using a custom route for performing healthchecks, you can check for a specific value from this url using the **checkstring** option of the action like so:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          healthcheck: ""https://[YOUR APP\'s NAME].herokuapp.com/health""\n          checkstring: ""ok""\n```\n\nThis will essentially check if the value returned by sending a GET request to the **healthcheck** url is equal to the **checkstring**\n\n### Adding Delay\n\nIn some cases, a healthcheck ends up being performed before the application has been setup on Heroku. To counter this, you can manually set the **delay** option in the action to make the action wait a certain period of time (in seconds) before performing the healthcheck\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          healthcheck: ""https://[YOUR APP\'s NAME].herokuapp.com/health""\n          checkstring: ""ok""\n          delay: 5\n```\n\nBy default, the delay will be 0 if you choose to not set it\n\n### Rollback on healthcheck failure\n\nYou can set the rollbackonhealthcheckfailed option to ensure that your application is rolled back if the healthcheck fails.\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          healthcheck: ""https://[YOUR APP\'s NAME].herokuapp.com/health""\n          checkstring: ""ok""\n          rollbackonhealthcheckfailed: true\n```\n\nBy default, the application will not be rolled back if the healthcheck fails.\n\nThanks to [FridaTveit](https://github.com/FridaTveit) for adding this feature\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nHeroku offers a means of passing sensitive information to your app (such as api keys etc) via something it calls **config vars** which you can find in the settings of your heroku app. But sometimes you might want to store sensitive information (api keys etc) in GitHub Secrets instead just to ensure platform independence. If you choose to this, you can then pass those secrets to your heroku app by using the ""env"" object of the action:-\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n        env:\n          HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE_API_KEY}}\n          HD_RANDOM_DATA: ""Hello""\n```\n\nNote that the variables must start with ""**HD\\_**"". This is is important so the action can tell your environment variable apart from multiple other variables (passed by your language, github actions etc) which you probably don\'t want sitting in your heroku app\'s config vars.\n\nOn that note, if you\'ve set these variables and have deployed your app, you can check your Heroku App\'s config vars and you\'ll find that they have been set with the env variables you have passed.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: The ""**HD\\_**"" will be scrapped from the variable your name by the action. So in your project, ""**FIREBASE_API_KEY**"" will be passed instead of ""**HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY**"" (for example) and you can see this if you check your Heroku App\'s config vars. We understand that this can be confusing but this is again to ensure Platform independence and so that you don\'t have to use HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY if you choose to stop using Heroku\n\n### ENV File\n\nYou can if you wish also pass the path to an env file (with respect to your appdir path) as an option to the action. The action will then read that file and set the config vars accordingly in Heroku\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          env_file: "".env""\n        env:\n          HD_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE_API_KEY}}\n          HD_RANDOM_DATA: ""Hello""\n```\n\nExample env file\n\n```\nHELLO=world\nWORLD=hello\n```\n\nThere are two important points to keep in mind when using the **env_file** option.\n\n1. The first is that in can be used in conjunction with **env** option of the action as you have seen above\n\n2. The second is that unlike in the **env** option, you do not need to prefix the env variables in the .env file with ""HD\\_"".\n\n   (For those of you who are wondering why this is the case, when using the **env** option, the env variables are passed directly into the process along with all the other env variables passed by GitHub Actions, the language you are using etc and the ""HD\\_"" in that case is to help differentiate your env variables from them. But when using a file to pass the env variables, the action manually reads the file so there is no chance of stray env variables being passed by your language, github actions etc and hence no need to add the ""HD\\_"")\n\nAlso note that using a file (which can be named anything so long as it follows the format of a standard env file) can be useful if you\'re trying to send a very large number of env variables to Heroku, it does mean that keeping the .env file secure and private is entirely in your hands so tread with caution.\n\n## Procfile Passing\n\nIn some cases, you might want to be able to set the Procfile within the action itself instead of declaring it manually in your project. Although this approach is not recommended in favor of just using multiple branches, it might still be useful in some edge cases. You can set the Procfile in the action by using the **procfile** option of the action like so:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME"" #Must be unique in Heroku\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          procfile: ""web: npm start""\n```\n\nKeep in mind this won\'t work if you are using Docker.\n\n## Deploying to a team\n\nIf you are an enterprise user and wish to deploy your app to a specific team, you can do so by just passing the **team** option to the action:\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: ""YOUR APP\'s NAME""\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          team: ""THE TEAM\'s NAME""\n```\n\n## Just Login\n\nGitHub Actions does come with the heroku cli pre-installed (this is what is used by the Action to deploy applications). So if you wish to use the heroku cli and just need to login, you can use the **justlogin** option of the Heroku Deploy Action\n\n_.github/workflows/main.yml_\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master # Changing the branch here would also work\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.14 # This is the action\n        with:\n          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n          heroku_app_name: """"\n          heroku_email: ""YOUR EMAIL""\n          justlogin: true\n      - run: heroku auth:whoami\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- You can check this repo\'s [_.github/workflows/main.yml_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for example use cases of the action in use. Additionally the APIs for these use cases can be found in the [_tests_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/tree/master/tests) folder of the repo\n\n- You can find the secrets tab in your project\'s settings\n\n- Be careful with your appname, cuz the action either deploys to an existing app or creates a new one if it doesn\'t exist. So if you accidently change it after deploying it once already, the action won\'t fail, it\'ll just create a new dyno and if you are on a paid plan, heroku can be expensive. On that note, always check the logs of your actions to make sure everything is A-OK.\n\n- If you\'re using the above exact workflow code, keep in mind that it deploys whenever you make a change to the master branch (Even README updates which have nothing to do with application code) and that might not be very efficient for you, have a look through the github actions docs to customize when the action should trigger.\n\n  (I would recommend making a separate dev branch and setting up the action to trigger upon pull request to the master branch)\n\n- By default, if you don\'t specify a branch in your action, it will default to the HEAD branch (or whichever branch the action is defined under). So you might be wondering what happens if you define the same action in a different branch under the same heroku app name (or which you try to deploy to the same appname from a different branch)? The answer is that the new branch overrides whatever your old branch was (even if the new branch is behind the old branch in terms of commits unless you set dontuseforce to true)\n\n- For more info on how Heroku enables deployment using Docker, check out [https://www.heroku.com/deploy-with-docker](https://www.heroku.com/deploy-with-docker)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Useful for removing directories you don\'t want in your final site for whatever reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n`DEPLOY_SITE` **Default**:`true` If we should try and build the site and deploy it the REMOTE_DIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n`BUILD_DIR` **Default**:`_site/` What directly will the site get built into.  *This is telling our deployment actions where to work, it does NOT change where your site gets built into, use your `_config.yml` for that*.\r\n\r\n\r\n`REMOTE_BRANCH` **Default**:`gh-pages` Which branch of the repo should we push our BUILD_DIR to?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThis would build and deploy the jekyll site contained within the `MySite` dir of the repo to the `staging` branch of the repo when ever the `dev` branch gets pushed to.\r\n\r\nChange `dev` to `master` if and remove the `JEKYLL_ROOT` and `REMOTE_BRANCH` `env` settings if you want vanilla default actions to happen when master gets pushed.\r\n\r\nThe `GITHUB_*` env variables are populated by github actions, they must be defined but you don\'t need to set them yourself. \r\n\r\n```yml\r\nname: Jekyll Build - Optional Deploy\r\n\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n    - dev\r\n\r\njobs: \r\n  build_and_deploy:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\r\n      - name: Building a jekyll site from configured directory, maybe deploying it.\r\n        env: \r\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_REPOSITORY }}\r\n          GITHUB_ACTOR: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACTOR }}\r\n          JEKYLL_ROOT: ""MySite/""\r\n          REMOTE_BRANCH: ""staging""\r\n        uses: agentd00nut/jekyll-build-optional-deploy-gh-pages@master\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Multiple sites\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t tested but it should be possible within the same job.  Just explicitly state all the env variables for each `- name`\'d use of the action.  \r\n\r\n## Gotchas\r\n\r\n**Changes pushed to your gh-pages branch will only be picked up by the Github Pages server if your workflow is in a private repository.**\r\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
528,"b""# `install-qt-action`\n\nInstalling Qt on Github Actions workflows manually is the worst.\n\nYou know what's easier than dealing with that? Just using this:\n```yml\n    - name: Install Qt\n      uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v2\n```\n\nAll done.\n\n## Options\n\n### `version`\nThe desired version of Qt to install.\n\nDefault: `5.12.6` (Latest LTS at the time of writing)\n\n### `host`\nThis is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It's unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.\n\nFor example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.\n\nPossible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`\n\nDefaults to the current platform it is being run on.\n\n### `target`\nThis is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. \n\n**Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts**\n\nPossible values: `desktop`, `android`, or `ios`\n\nDefault: `desktop`\n\n### `arch`\nThis is the target architecture that your program will be built for. This is only used for Windows and Android.\n\n**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro's repository or building it manually.\n\n**Possible values:**\n\nWindows: `win64_msvc2017_64`, `win64_msvc2015_64`, `win32_msvc2015`, `win32_mingw53`, or `win64_mingw73`\n\nAndroid: `android_x86`, `android_armv7`\n\n**Default values:**\n\nWindows: `win64_msvc2017_64`\n\nAndroid: `android_armv7`\n\n### `dir`\nThis is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.\n\nFor example, if you set dir to `/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `/example/Qt/5.12.6/(your_arch)/bin`. When possible, access your Qt directory through the `Qt5_Dir` environment variable.\n\nDefault: `${RUNNER_WORKSPACE}` (this is one folder above the starting directory)\n\n### `install-deps`\nWhether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux (you probably want to leave this on).\n\nDefault: `true`\n\n### `modules`\nList of additional addon modules to install, with each entry seperated by a space. If you need one of these, you'll know it.\n\nPossible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, possibly others\n\nDefault: none\n\n### `cached`\nIf it is set to `true`, then Qt won't be downloaded, but the environment variables will be set, and essential build tools will be installed.\n\nIt can be used with [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache), for example:\n\n```\n- name: Cache Qt\n  id: cache-qt\n  uses: actions/cache@v1\n  with:\n    path: ../Qt\n    key: QtCache\n\n- name: Install Qt\n  uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v2\n  with:\n    cached: ${{ steps.cache-qt.outputs.cache-hit }}\n```\n\n### `aqtversion`\n\nVersion of [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall), in the form used by pip, for example: `==0.7.1`, `>=0.7.1`, `==0.7.*`.\n\n## More info\n\nThe Qt bin directory is added to your `path` environment variable. `Qt5_Dir` is also set appropriately for cmake. \n\nBig thanks to the [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/) developers for making this easy. Please go support them, they did all of the hard work here.\n\nThis action is distributed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\n\nBy using this action, you agree to the terms of Qt's licensing.

Create a release!\n\n> While this action is meant for releases, you can also configure it to be triggered on each push or pull request. If so, make sure to set the `title` and `url` parameters since they, by default, use values from a release.\n\n## Parameters\n\n#### `username`\n\n**Required** Your Reddit username.\n\n#### `password`\n\n**Required** Your Reddit password.\n\n#### `app-id`\n\n**Required** The app ID.\n\n#### `app-secret`\n\n**Required** The app secret.\n\n#### `subreddit`\n\n**Required** The subreddit to post.\n\n#### `title`\n\n**Optional** The post title.\n\nDefault: `${{ github.repository }} ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }} Released`\n\nThe default would output e.g. ""bluwy/awesome-lib v1.0.0 Released""\n\n> More info on the different contexts that can be used: [Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)\n\n> All available properties of `github.event.release`: [Example response object](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release)\n\n#### `url`\n\n**Optional** The post URL.\n\nDefault: `${{ github.event.release.html_url }}`\n\nThe default would output e.g. ""https://github.com/bluwy/awesome-lib/releases/tag/v1.0.0"". If the URL links to a Reddit post, it\'ll do a crosspost instead.\n\n#### `flair-id`\n\n**Optional** The post flair\'s ID. [More info](#how-do-i-set-a-flair)\n\n#### `flair-text`\n\n**Optional** The post flair\'s text (applicable if text_editable is true). [More info](#how-do-i-set-a-flair).\n\n#### `comment`\n\n**Optional** A comment to add for your post. You can use this as a changelog excerpt for the lazy. Will not comment if this is not set or empty.\n\nFor example, if your changelog happens to be your release description, you can set this to `${{ github.event.release.body }}`.\n\n#### `notification`\n\n**Optional** Whether to have replies on post and comments to be sent to inbox. Set `true` to enable.\n\nDefault: `false`\n\n#### `retry-rate-limit`\n\n**Optional** How many times to retry if it hits the rate limit. This will wait for the limit to end before retrying. To disable retries, set this to `0`. [More info](#whats-the-rate-limit-error).\n\nDefault: `1`\n\n## Outputs\n\nOutput can be accessed in `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<key> }}`, where `<id>` is the id of a step, `<key>` is the values below.\n\n#### `postUrl`\n\nThe link to the post if successfully submitted.\n\n> Tip: You can pass this url back to another reddit action\'s `url` parameter to do a crosspost! [Example](https://github.com/bluwy/release-for-reddit-action-test/blob/f0ff92913e453ac14b590445d60c99ede8516148/.github/workflows/release.yml#L32).\n\n#### `commentUrl`\n\nThe link to the comment if a comment text is defined and succesfully submitted.\n\n## FAQs\n\n#### Why do I need to provide my username and password? It already has my app\'s ID and secret.\n\nThat\'s how the Reddit OAuth API works. To get the access token, you have to supply your username, password, app ID and app secret.\n\nCheck out [Reddit\'s quick start example](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example) which also requires the four information for authentication. (If you get rate limit issues, make sure to set a different user agent)\n\n#### How do I set a flair?\n\nSetting a flair requires its flair ID. To find the supported flairs for a subreddit, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/api/link_flair.json. Replace ""subreddit"" with your target subreddit and make sure you\'re logged in for this to work.\n\nThe endpoint will return a list of flairs in JSON format, which you can choose one using the flair id.\n\nIf the flair\'s `text_editable` property is true, you can set the `flair-text` parameter to set a custom text for the flair.\n\n#### What\'s the rate limit error?\n\nThere are two kinds of rate limit in Reddit. One is the request limit to the `oauth.reddit.com` endpoint, which is a generous 600 request per 10 minutes. This action will never hit this limit unless you\'re also using the API for other clients.\n\nThe other rate limit is for post and comments submissions. If you start with a new account, it\'s very likely to get up to 10 minutes of rate limiting. You will likely hit this issue more often than the `oauth` rate limit.\n\nThough Reddit doesn\'t explicitly tell how the submission rate limit is calculated, various sources from the admins mentioned that having an older account and higher karma (especially in the specific subreddit) helps reduce this limit.\n\n> In the development of this action, the rate limit was significantly reduced after the 24 hour mark of account creation.\n\n#### What\'s the `invalid-grant` error?\n\nIf you encounter this error, make sure your credentials are entered correctly, which are your username, password, app ID and app secret.\n\nIf this does not work, follow [Reddit\'s cURL quick start](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example) and try to retrive an access token. (If you get rate limit issues, make sure to set a different user agent). If it works, please file an issue!\n\nIf the above didn\'t work, create a new account and use that instead. (This also happened to me).\n\n> Keep in mind that new accounts are heavily rate limited.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

534,"b'# WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update\n\n> Deploy readme and asset updates to the WordPress Plugin Repository.\n\n[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/LICENSE)\n\nThis Action commits any readme and WordPress.org-specific assets changes in your specified branch to the WordPress.org plugin repository if no other changes have been made since the last deployment to WordPress.org. This is useful for updating things like screenshots or `Tested up to` separately from functional changes, provided your Git branching methodology avoids changing anything else in the specified branch between functional releases. It is **highly recommended** that you use a stable branch where you only merge readme/asset commits in between larger functional merges that only occur when preparing for a release (often implemented as `master` vs. `develop`).\n\nBecause the WordPress.org plugin repository shows information from the readme in the specified `Stable tag`, this Action also attempts to parse out the stable tag from your readme and deploy to there as well as `trunk`. If your stable tag is `trunk` or a tag that does not exist in the `tags` subfolder, it will skip that part of the update and only update `trunk` and/or `assets`.\n\n**Important note:** If your development process leads to a situation where `master` (or other specified branch) only contains changes to the readme or assets directory since the last sync to the plugin directory and those changes are in preparation for the next release, those changes will go live and potentially be misleading to users. Usage of this Action assumes a fairly traditional Git methodology that involves merging all changes to `master` when functional changes are ready and that this seemingly unlikely situation will therefore not happen in your repo; there are no safeguards against syncing changes based on readme/asset content, as that cannot be predicted.\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e This Action is meant to be used in tandem with our [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy)\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Required secrets\n\n* `SVN_USERNAME`\n* `SVN_PASSWORD`\n\n[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.\n\n### Optional environment variables\n\n* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.\n* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`).\n* `README_NAME` - defaults to `readme.txt`, customizable in case you use `README.md` instead, which is now quietly supported in the WordPress.org plugin repository.\n\n## Example Workflow File\n\n```yml\nname: Plugin asset/readme update\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\njobs:\n  master:\n    name: Push to master\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - name: WordPress.org plugin asset/readme update\n      uses: 10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update@master\n      env:\n        SVN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SVN_PASSWORD }}\n        SVN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SVN_USERNAME }}\n```\n\n### Known issues\n\n* It would be more efficient to additionally use the `paths` filter for the `push` action to reduce the number of runs. So far in testing it is possible to limit it to pushes that include readme/asset files as specified, but not ones that *only* include those files. The Action itself still needs to run as written because it compares the totality of changes in the branch against what\'s in SVN and not just the contents of the current push.\n\n## Changelog\n\nA complete listing of all notable changes to WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWant to help?

535,"b'# Actions Tagger\n\n:speedboat: Keep your action versions up-to-date by automatically promoting a major tag (and optionally, a `latest` tag) each time a release is created.\n\n# Rationale\n\nAccording to the github actions [versioning guide](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md#versioning), actions publishers should have a major tag (`v1`, `v2`, etc) which points to the latest version of any minor/patch release of their action, for ease of use by the others.\n\nI found this process quite tedious, and repetetive which is why this action exists. If you have published an action and would like to have your action follow the same versioning structure as many others in the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions), then simply create a release workflow that includes this action.

by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_\nactivate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the\n`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the\n`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.\n\n## Inputs and outputs\n\nFor a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see\n[action.yml](action.yml).\n\n### Use a different environment name or path\n\nYou can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path\nby setting the `activate-environment` input option.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    activate-environment: whatever\n```\n\nThis will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is\nthe path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""\nMiniconda installation.\n\n> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will\n>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology. Use this to\n>   avoid ""path too long""-style errors, especially on Windows.\n> - Self-hosted runners can emulate the ""bundled"" Miniconda approach by\n>   pre-installing a [constructor]-based installer and ensuring `$CONDA` is set\n>   prior to starting `setup-miniconda`\n\n### Activate `base` environment\n\nIf your specific workflow still needs to activate and use `base` you will need\nto do **both** of:\n\n- set `activate-environment` to an empty string\n- set `auto-activate-base` to `true`\n\n```yaml\n- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    auto-activate-base: true\n    activate-environment: """"\n```\n\n## Usage examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic usage\n\nThis example shows how to set a basic python workflow with conda using the\ncrossplatform available shells: `bash` and `pwsh`. On this example an\nenvironment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`\ninstalled for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-1:\n    name: Ex1 (${{ matrix.python-version }}, ${{ matrix.os }})\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu-latest"", ""macos-latest"", ""windows-latest""]\n        python-version: [""3.7"", ""2.7""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          auto-update-conda: true\n          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n      - name: Conda info\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: conda info\n      - name: Conda list\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: conda list\n```\n\n### Example 2: Other shells\n\nThis example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating\nsystems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version\navailable and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-2-linux:\n    name: Ex2 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-mac:\n    name: Ex2 Mac\n    runs-on: ""macos-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Sh\n        shell: sh -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-win:\n    name: Ex2 Windows\n    runs-on: ""windows-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell\n        shell: powershell\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Cmd.exe\n        shell: cmd /C CALL {0}\n        run: >-\n          conda info && conda list\n```\n\n### Example 3: Other options\n\nThis example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for\neasier creation of test/build environments and\n[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration\nmanagement. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an\nenvironment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment\nbefore activating the `anaconda-client-env`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-3:\n    name: Ex3 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          python-version: 3.5\n          condarc-file: etc/example-condarc.yml\n          auto-activate-base: false\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n```\n\n### Example 4: Conda options\n\nThis example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The\npriority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will\nresult in:\n\n- conda-forge\n- spyder-ide\n- defaults\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-4:\n    name: Ex4 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: foo\n          python-version: 3.6\n          channels: conda-forge,spyder-ide\n          allow-softlinks: true\n          channel-priority: flexible\n          show-channel-urls: true\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n```\n\n### Example 5: Custom installer\n\nAny installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)\nwhich includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,\n[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of\n[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not\nyet supported by Miniconda. For more, see [Example 10](#example-10-miniforge).\n\n> Notes:\n>\n> - Installer downloads are cached based on their full URL: adding some\n>   non-functional salt to the URL will prevent this behavior, e.g.\n>   `#${{ github.run_number }}`\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-5:\n    name: Ex5 Miniforge for PyPy\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          installer-url: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/download/4.8.3-2/Miniforge-pypy3-4.8.3-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n          allow-softlinks: true\n          show-channel-urls: true\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n```\n\n### Example 6: Mamba\n\nExperimental! Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.\n`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires\nyou specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest\npriority.\n\n> Notes:\n>\n> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it\n>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)\n>   with `use-mamba: true`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-6:\n    name: Ex6 Mamba\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.6\n          mamba-version: ""*""\n          channels: conda-forge,defaults\n          channel-priority: true\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n      - shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n          printenv | sort\n      - shell: bash -l {0}\n        run: mamba install jupyterlab\n```\n\n### Example 7: Lockfiles\n\n`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit\nenvironment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution\nstep altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to\nreproduce the environment.\n\nThis means explicitly-defined environments...\n\n- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:\n  - channels are not queried for their repo data\n  - no solver is run\n- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain\n  platform/architecture information\n- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable\n\nThis approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow\nthat runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.\n\n[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock\n[explicit-spec]:\n  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-7:\n    name: Ex7 Explicit\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      -

uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Cache conda\n        uses: actions/cache@v2\n        env:\n          # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n          CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n        with:\n          path: ~/conda_pkgs_dir\n          key:\n            ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}-${{\n            hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment.yml\') }}\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          channel-priority: strict\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true # IMPORTANT: This needs to be set for caching to work properly!\n```\n\nIf you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then\nyou may want to\n[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),\nas they are not included in the conda package cache.\n\n### Caching environments\n\nA Miniforge variant is recommended to cache deployed environments, since the\nMiniconda installation path requires succesive changes of folder ownership in\norder to work with the `cache` action.\n\nEvery operating system use a different Miniforge `prefix`, so if you want to\ncache the environment on all of them you must use a `matrix` strategy.\n\n```yaml\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        include:\n          - os: ubuntu-latest\n            label: linux-64\n            prefix: /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/anaconda-client-env\n\n          - os: macos-latest\n            label: osx-64\n            prefix: /Users/runner/miniconda3/envs/anaconda-client-env\n\n          - os: windows-latest\n            label: win-64\n            prefix: C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\anaconda-client-env\n```\n\nThen, the first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without\nspecifying a environment file.\n\n```yaml\n      - name: Setup Mambaforge\n        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n            miniforge-version: latest\n            activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n            use-mamba: true\n```\n\nIt\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies\nof package versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. You can \nskip that step if you use a resolved environment file product of\n`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.\n\n```yaml\n      - name: Set cache date\n        run: echo ""DATE=$(date +\'%Y%m%d\')"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n        \n      - uses: actions/cache@v2\n        with:\n          path: ${{ matrix.prefix }}\n          key: ${{ matrix.label }}-conda-${{ hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment-caching.yml\') }}-${{ env.DATE }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}\n        env:\n          # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n          CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n        id: cache\n```\n\nKeep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the\nsame as hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves\nthe dependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages\navailable on the channels at installation time. Since packages are updated\nall the time, you will not see these changes reflected in the cache until\nthe key gets updated by date.\n\n**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally\nbut fail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache\nmanually to see if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved\nenvironment file.**\n\nFinally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache\ndoes not exist.\n\n```yaml\n      - name: Update environment\n        run: mamba env update -n anaconda-client-env -f etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n        if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n```\n\n### Use a default shell\n\nAssuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -l {0}` to\nevery single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all\nthe steps.\n\nBy adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -l {0}`, all steps in\nthe job will default to that value.\n\nFor other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default\nvalue. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.\n\nMore information the\n[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  default-shell:\n    name: Default shell\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -l {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n      - run: conda info\n      - run: conda list\n      - run: conda config --show\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\n- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly\n  activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are executed\n  with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash\n  profile files made by `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)\n  and\n  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).\n- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly\n  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed\n  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by\n  `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be\n  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are\n  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag\n  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which\n  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`\n  option to `true`.\n- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda\n  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a\n  version of conda compatible with the option.\n- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the\n  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide\n  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was\n  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts\n  and result in very long install times.\n- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`.

It also defines separate custom Github action steps for building Python wheels and source distributions, validating repository metadata, and publishing to PyPI.\nThis repository does not need to be cloned or interacted with in order to take advantage of the service.\nSee below for documentation.\n\nDefault criteria for publishing a release:\n   * Tag must conform to the semantic versioning specification (https://semver.org/). i.e.\n      * 0.0.8\n      * 1.0.0\n      * 1.0.0-alpha\n      * 1.0.0-alpha.1\n\n## How to use\n\nThe publication mechanism is provided on an opt-in basis to repositories within the following Github organizations:\n   * spacetelescope\n\nStipulations:\n   * If the project being published already exists on PyPI, the PyPI account named `stsci_maintainer` must be defined as a \'maintainer\'.\n      * If you wish to specify the set of credentials used to publish the package, please see [Using other credentials](#othercreds) below.\n   * If the project does not yet exist, it will be created on PyPI by the account `stsci_maintainer`.\n\n### To add publication capability to a repository\n\n   1) On the main repository page, click **Actions** at the top, just below the name of the repository.\n   2) In the **Workflows made for your Python repository**, locate the ""*Publish to PyPI*"" workflow made by ""Space Telescope Science Institute"".\n   3) Click the **Set up this workflow** button. This will open a commit page with the workflow code that will be added to the repository.\n   4) Click the **Start Commit** button in the upper right hand corner.\n   5) Add a descriptive commit message if you like. ""Activating automatic PyPI publication"" or similar.\n   6) Click **Commit new file**.\n   \nWhenever a new release with a semver-compliant tag is made on Github from the repository, the package will be created and published to PyPI using the `stsci_maintainer` account.\n\n<a name=""othercreds""></a>\n\n### Using other credentials\n\nThe default set of credentials used to publish packages to PyPI are those of the PyPI account `stsci_maintainer`. If you want or need to use other credentials, they may be specified as secrets in the settings of the Github repository.\n\n   1) Open the **Settings** page of the repository (top portion of the page, on the line under the repository name).\n   2) Select **Secrets** from the list on the left hand side.\n   3) Define a secret with the name `PYPI_USERNAME_STSCI_MAINTAINER` the value of which is the PyPI username to be used.\n   4) Define another secret with the name `PYPI_PASSWORD_STSCI_MAINTAINER` the value of which is the PyPI password to be used.\n   \nWhenever a new release is made, the package will be created and published to PyPI using the supplied credentials.\n\n### Testing the workflow\n\nBy default, the workflow will publish to the production PyPI repository. For testing purposes, it can be configured to publish to the test PyPI repository at https://test.pypi.org by creating a secret called `PYPI_TEST`:\n\n   1) Open the **Settings** page of the repository (top portion of the page, on the line under the repository name).\n   2) Select **Secrets** from the list on the left hand side.\n   3) Define a secret with the name `PYPI_TEST` the value of which is \'true\'.\n\n## Problems\n\nIf a problem occurs with the publication, an e-mail message with ""Run failed: Publish to PyPI"" in the subject will be sent to all users subscribed to notifications from the repository in question. The message will contain a link to the logs from the publication attempt.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

546,"b'# Detect and Tag New Version [![test-status](https://github.com/dfreeman/action-detect-and-tag-new-version/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dfreeman/action-detect-and-tag-new-version/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)\n\nThis action allows you to detect a new version of your repository based on some change in its contents between commits, creating a git tag if a new version is detected.\n\nFor example, in a JavaScript repo, you could detect that the `version` field in `package.json` had changed from `""1.0.0""` to `""1.1.0""` and therefore create a `v1.1.0` tag from the current commit.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe configuration below would create a new version tag in your repository any time the contents of a `current-version.txt` file changed.\n\n**Note**: since this action examines your git history to detect changes, you must set a `fetch-depth` of at least `2` with `actions/checkout` for that history to be present.\n\n```yml\n# ...\njobs:\n  tag-new-versions:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 2\n      - uses: salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version@v2\n        with:\n          version-command: |\n            cat current-version.txt\n```\n\n### Inputs\n\nAll inputs are optional.\n\n - `version-command`: a shell command that will be executed at the current HEAD and the previous commit. This command\'s\n   output to stdout will be considered the effective version of your repository at a given commit. If unspecified,\n   this action will attempt to determine an appropriate command to run automatically, as described below.\n - `create-tag`: may be set to `false` to only detect version changes and not create a new tag when the version changes.\n - `tag-template`: a template for producing a tag name from the current version of your repository. Any instance of\n   `{VERSION}` in the string will be replaced with the actual detected version. Defaults to `v{VERSION}`.\n - `tag-annotation-template`: a template for producing a tag annotation from the current version of your repository. As\n   with `tag-template`, any instance of `{VERSION}` in the string will be replaced with the actual detected version.\n   May be set to an empty string to produce a lightweight (i.e. annotation-less) tag. Defaults to\n   `Released version {VERSION}`.\n\n### Outputs\n\n - `previous-version`: the detected previous version of this repository\n - `current-version`: the detected current version of this repository\n - `tag`: if a new tag is created, this output will contain its name\n\n## Version Determination\n\nIf no `version-command` input is provided, this action will attempt to do something sensible by default.\n - If it finds a `package.json`, it will consider the contents of the `version` field there to be the repository version.\n - If it finds single `*.gemspec` file, it will consider the version defined there to be the repository version.\n\nThe logic for this detection and the corresponding version commands used can be found in [`determine-version.ts`](src/determine-version.ts).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Usually `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.\n- **commit_sha** _(optional)_ - The commit SHA value to add the tag. If specified, it uses this value instead GITHUB_SHA. It could be useful when a previous step merged a branch into github.ref.\n\n#### Fetch all tags\n\n- **fetch_all_tags** _(optional)_ - By default, this action fetch the last 100 tags from Github. Sometimes, this is not enough and using this action will fetch all tags recursively (default: `false`).\n\n#### Filter branches\n\n- **release_branches** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (JavaScript regular expression accepted) that will generate the release tags. Other branches and pull-requests generate versions postfixed with the commit hash and do not generate any repository tag. Examples: `master` or `.*` or `release.*,hotfix.*,master`... (default: `master,main`).\n- **pre_release_branches** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (JavaScript regular expression accepted) that will generate the pre-release tags.\n\n#### Customize the tag\n\n- **default_bump** _(optional)_ - Which type of bump to use when [none is explicitly provided](#bumping) when commiting to a release branch (default: `patch`). You can also set `false` to avoid generating a new tag when none is explicitly provided. Can be `patch, minor or major`.\n- **default_prerelease_bump** _(optional)_ - Which type of bump to use when [none is explicitly provided](#bumping) when commiting to a prerelease branch (default: `prerelease`). You can also set `false` to avoid generating a new tag when none is explicitly provided. Can be `prerelease, prepatch, preminor or premajor`.\n- **custom_tag** _(optional)_ - Custom tag name. If specified, it overrides bump settings.\n- **create_annotated_tag** _(optional)_ - Boolean to create an annotated rather than a lightweight one (default: `false`).\n- **tag_prefix** _(optional)_ - A prefix to the tag name (default: `v`).\n- **append_to_pre_release_tag** _(optional)_ - A suffix to the pre-release tag name (default: `<branch>`).\n\n#### Customize the conventional commit messages & titles of changelog sections\n\n- **custom_release_rules** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of release rules.\n\n  __Format__: `<keyword>:<release_type>:<changelog_section>` where `<changelog_section>` is optional and will default to [Angular's conventions](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).\n\n  __Examples__:\n    1. `hotfix:patch,pre-feat:preminor`,\n    2. `bug:patch:Bug Fixes,chore:patch:Chores`\n\n#### Debugging\n\n- **dry_run** _(optional)_ - Do not perform tagging, just calculate next version and changelog, then exit\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x93\xa4 Outputs\n\n- **new_tag** - The value of the newly calculated tag. Note that if there hasn't been any new commit, this will be `undefined`.\n- **new_version** - The value of the newly created tag without the prefix. Note that if there hasn't been any new commit, this will be `undefined`.\n- **previous_tag** - The value of the previous tag (or `v0.0.0` if none). Note that if `custom_tag` is set, this will be `undefined`.\n- **previous_version** - The value of the previous tag (or `0.0.0` if none) without the prefix. Note that if `custom_tag` is set, this will be `undefined`.\n- **release_type** - The computed release type (`major`, `minor`, `patch` or `custom` - can be prefixed with `pre`).\n- **changelog** - The [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) since the previous tag.\n\n> **_Note:_** This action creates a [lightweight tag](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference) by default.\n\n### Bumping\n\nThe action will parse the new commits since the last tag using the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) conventions.\n\nsemantic-release uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, semantic-release automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number.\n\nBy default semantic-release uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).\n\nHere is an example of the release type that will be done based on a commit messages:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td> Commit message </td> <td> Release type </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n```\nfix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>Patch Release</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n```\nfeat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>Minor Release</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n```\nperf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.\nThe default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>Major Release</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nIf no commit message contains any information, then **default_bump** will be used.\n\n## Credits\n\n[anothrNick/github-tag-action](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action) - a similar action using a Dockerfile (hence not working on macOS)\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Can be one of: `ascending`, `descending`. Default: `descending`.                                                                                  |\n\nRelease Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.\n\n## Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in your `template`:\n\n| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |\n| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |\n| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |\n| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases\xe2\x80\x99s tag.                                                                                          |\n\n## Next Version Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:\n\n| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |\n| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |\n| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |\n\n## Version Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:\n\n| Variable | Description               |\n| -------- | ------------------------- |\n| `$PATCH` | The patch version number. |\n| `$MINOR` | The minor version number. |\n| `$MAJOR` | The major version number. |\n\n## Change Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:\n\n| Variable  | Description                                                 |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NUMBER` | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                  |\n| `$TITLE`  | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. |\n| `$AUTHOR` | The pull request author\xe2\x80\x99s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.     |\n\n## Categorize Pull Requests\n\nWith the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    label: \'feature\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />\n\nAdding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).\n\n## Exclude Pull Requests\n\nWith the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nexclude-labels:\n  - \'skip-changelog\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.\n\n## Replacers\n\nYou can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option.

If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.\n\n## GitHub Installation Permissions\n\nRelease Drafter requires full write, because GitHub does not offer a limited scope for only writing releases. **Don\'t install Release Drafter to your entire GitHub account \xe2\x80\x94 only add the repositories you want to draft releases on.**\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nyarn\n\n# Run the tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run the app locally\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):\n\n```sh\n# Run the tests\ndocker-compose run --rm app npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThird-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nIf you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.\n\n## Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).\n\n## Releasing\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]\n```\n\nThe command does the following:\n\n- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes\n- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch\n- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:\n  - Pushes the tag to GitHub\n  - Publishes the npm release\n  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)\n  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

556,"b'# GitHub Action for Dispatching Workflows\n\nThis action triggers another GitHub Actions workflow, using the `workflow_dispatch` event.  \nThe workflow must be configured for this event type e.g. `on: [workflow_dispatch]`\n\nThis allows you to chain workflows, the classic use case is have a CI build workflow, trigger a CD release/deploy workflow when it completes. Allowing you to maintain separate workflows for CI and CD, and pass data between them as required.\n\nFor details of the `workflow_dispatch` even see [this blog post introducing this type of trigger](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/)\n\n*Note 1.* GitHub now has a native way to chain workflows called ""reusable workflows"". See the docs on [reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows). This approach is somewhat different from workflow_dispatch but it\'s worth keeping in mind.\n\n*Note 2.* The GitHub UI will report flows triggered by this action as ""manually triggered"" even though they have been run programmatically via another workflow and the API.\n\n*Note 3.* If you want to reference the target workflow by ID, you will need to list them with the following REST API call `curl https://api.github.com/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/actions/workflows -H ""Authorization: token {{pat-token}}""`\n\n## Action Inputs\n\n### `workflow`\n**Required.** The name, filename or ID of the workflow to be triggered and run. All three possibilities are used when looking for the workflow. e.g.\n\n```yaml\nworkflow: My Workflow\n# or\nworkflow: my-workflow.yaml\n# or\nworkflow: 1218419\n```\n\n### `inputs`\n**Optional.** The inputs to pass to the workflow (if any are configured), this must be a JSON encoded string, e.g. `{ ""myInput"": ""foobar"" }`\n\n### `ref`\n**Optional.** The Git reference used with the triggered workflow run. The reference can be a branch, tag, or a commit SHA. If omitted the context ref of the triggering workflow is used. If you want to trigger on pull requests and run the target workflow in the context of the pull request branch, set the ref to `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`. \n\n### `repo`\n**Optional.** The default behavior is to trigger workflows in the same repo as the triggering workflow, if you wish to trigger in another GitHub repo ""externally"", then provide the owner + repo name with slash between them e.g. `microsoft/vscode`.\n\n- When triggering across repos like this, you **must** provide a `token` (see below), or you will get an *""Resource not accessible by integration""* error.\n- If the default branch in the other repo is different from the calling repo, you must provide `ref` input also, or you will get a *""No ref found""* error.\n\n### `token`\n**Optional.** By default the standard `github.token`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used and you no longer need to provide your own token here. However when using the `repo` option, you must provide a token here, create a PAT token with repo rights, and pass it here via a secret. This options is also left for backwards compatibility reasons.\n\n\n## Action Outputs\nThis Action emits a single output named `workflowId`.\n\n\n## Example usage\n```yaml\n- name: Invoke workflow without inputs\n  uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1\n  with:\n    workflow: My Workflow\n```\n\n```yaml\n- name: Invoke workflow with inputs\n  uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1\n  with:\n    workflow: Another Workflow\n    inputs: \'{ ""message"": ""blah blah"", ""something"": true }\'\n```\n\n```yaml\n- name: Invoke workflow in another repo with inputs\n  uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1\n  with:\n    workflow: my-workflow.yaml\n    repo: benc-uk/example\n    inputs: \'{ ""message"": ""blah blah"", ""something"": false }\'\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

564,"b'# WordPress.org Plugin Deploy - ***Github Action***\nThis Action commits the contents of your Git tag to the WordPress.org plugin repository using the same tag name. \nIt excludes Git-specific items or files and directories as optionally defined in your `.wporgignore` file, and \nmoves anything from a `.wordpress-org` subdirectory to the top-level `assets` directory in Subversion (plugin banners, icons, and screenshots).\n\n## Configuration\n### Required secrets\n* `WORDPRESS_USERNAME`\n* `WORDPRESS_PASSWORD`\n* `GITHUB_TOKEN` - you do not need to generate one but you do have to explicitly make it available to the Action\n\nSecrets can be set while editing your workflow or in the repository settings. They cannot be viewed once stored. [GitHub secrets documentation](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets/)\n\n### Optional environment variables\n* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug. This should be a very rare case as WordPress assumes that the directory and initial plugin file have the same slug.\n* `VERSION` - defaults to the tag name; do not recommend setting this except for testing purposes\n* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`)\n* `IGNORE_FILE` - defaults to `.wporgignore`, customizable for other locations of list of files to be ignore like `.gitignore`\n* `ASSETS_IGNORE_FILE` - defaults to `.wporgassetsignore`, customizable for other locations of list of files to be ignore like `.gitignore`\n* `DIST_LOCATION` - defaults to `./dist/`, option to save final zip files.\n\n### Excluding files from deployment\nIf there are files or directories to be excluded from deployment, such as tests or editor config files, they can be specified in your `.wporgignore` file. If you use this method, please be sure to include the following items:\n\n```gitignore\n# Directories\n.wordpress-org\n.github\n\n# Files\n/.gitattributes\n/.gitignore\n```\n\n> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note:** You Should Provide Github Token.

It doesn\'t yet support everything `jq` does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.\n\nyq is written in go - so you can download a dependency free binary for your platform and you are good to go! If you prefer there are a variety of package managers that can be used as well as Docker and Podman, all listed below.\n\n## Quick Usage Guide\n\nRead a value:\n```bash\nyq \'.a.b[0].c\' file.yaml\n```\n\nPipe from STDIN:\n```bash\nyq \'.a.b[0].c\' < file.yaml\n```\n\nUpdate a yaml file, inplace\n```bash\nyq -i \'.a.b[0].c = ""cool""\' file.yaml\n```\n\nUpdate using environment variables\n```bash\nNAME=mike yq -i \'.a.b[0].c = strenv(NAME)\' file.yaml\n```\n\nMerge multiple files\n```bash\n# note the use of `ea` to evaluate all the files at once\n# instead of in sequence\nyq ea \'. as $item ireduce ({}; . * $item )\' path/to/*.yml\n```\n\nMultiple updates to a yaml file\n```bash\nyq -i \'\n  .a.b[0].c = ""cool"" |\n  .x.y.z = ""foobar"" |\n  .person.name = strenv(NAME)\n\' file.yaml\n```\n\nConvert JSON to YAML\n```bash\nyq -Poy sample.json\n```\n\nSee the [documentation](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) for more examples.\n\nTake a look at the discussions for [common questions](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/discussions/categories/q-a), and [cool ideas](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)\n\n## Install\n\n### [Download the latest binary](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest)\n\n### wget\nUse wget to download, gzipped pre-compiled binaries:\n\n\nFor instance, VERSION=v4.2.0 and BINARY=yq_linux_amd64\n\n#### Compressed via tar.gz\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/${VERSION}/${BINARY}.tar.gz -O - |\\\n  tar xz && mv ${BINARY} /usr/bin/yq\n```\n\n#### Plain binary\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/${VERSION}/${BINARY} -O /usr/bin/yq &&\\\n    chmod +x /usr/bin/yq\n```\n\n#### Latest version\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/bin/yq &&\\\n    chmod +x /usr/bin/yq\n```\n\n### MacOS / Linux via Homebrew:\nUsing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n```\nbrew install yq\n```\n\n### Linux via snap:\n```\nsnap install yq\n```\n\n#### Snap notes\n`yq` installs with [_strict confinement_](https://docs.snapcraft.io/snap-confinement/6233) in snap, this means it doesn\'t have direct access to root files. To read root files you can:\n\n```\nsudo cat /etc/myfile | yq \'.a.path\'\n```\n\nAnd to write to a root file you can either use [sponge](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge):\n```\nsudo cat /etc/myfile | yq \'.a.path = ""value""\' | sudo sponge /etc/myfile\n```\nor write to a temporary file:\n```\nsudo cat /etc/myfile | yq \'.a.path = ""value""\' | sudo tee /etc/myfile.tmp\nsudo mv /etc/myfile.tmp /etc/myfile\nrm /etc/myfile.tmp\n```\n\n### Run with Docker or Podman\n#### Oneshot use:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir mikefarah/yq [command] [flags] [expression ]FILE...\n```\n\nNote that you can run `yq` in docker without network access and other privileges if you desire,\nnamely `--security-opt=no-new-privileges --cap-drop all --network none`.\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir mikefarah/yq [command] [flags] [expression ]FILE...\n```\n\n#### Pipe in via STDIN:\n\nYou\'ll need to pass the `-i\\--interactive` flag to docker:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm mikefarah/yq \'.this.thing\' < myfile.yml\n```\n\n```bash\npodman run -i --rm mikefarah/yq \'.this.thing\' < myfile.yml\n```\n\n#### Run commands interactively:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq\n```\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -it -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq\n```\n\nIt can be useful to have a bash function to avoid typing the whole docker command:\n\n```bash\nyq() {\n  docker run --rm -i -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir mikefarah/yq ""$@""\n}\n```\n\n```bash\nyq() {\n  podman run --rm -i -v ""${PWD}"":/workdir mikefarah/yq ""$@""\n}\n```\n#### Running as root:\n\n`yq`\'s container image no longer runs under root (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/pull/860). If you\'d like to install more things in the container image, or you\'re having permissions issues when attempting to read/write files you\'ll need to either:\n\n\n```\ndocker run --user=""root"" -it --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq\n```\n\n```\npodman run --user=""root"" -it --entrypoint sh mikefarah/yq\n```\n\nOr, in your Dockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM mikefarah/yq\n\nUSER root\nRUN apk add --no-cache bash\nUSER yq\n```\n\n#### Missing timezone data\nBy default, the alpine image yq uses does not include timezone data. If you\'d like to use the `tz` operator, you\'ll need to include this data:\n\n```\nFROM mikefarah/yq\n\nUSER root\nRUN apk add --no-cache tzdata\nUSER yq\n```\n\n#### Podman with SELinux\n\nIf you are using podman with SELinux, you will need to set the shared volume flag `:z` on the volume mount:\n\n```\n-v ""${PWD}"":/workdir:z\n```\n\n### GitHub Action\n```\n  - name: Set foobar to cool\n    uses: mikefarah/yq@master\n    with:\n      cmd: yq -i \'.foo.bar = ""cool""\' \'config.yml\'\n  - name: Get an entry with a variable that might contain dots or spaces\n    id: get_username\n    uses: mikefarah/yq@master\n    with:\n      cmd: yq \'.all.children.[""${{ matrix.ip_address }}""].username\' ops/inventories/production.yml\n  - name: Reuse a variable obtained in another step\n    run: echo ${{ steps.get_username.outputs.result }}\n```\n\nSee https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/usage/github-action for more.\n\n### Go Install:\n```\ngo install github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4@latest\n```\n\n## Community Supported Installation methods\nAs these are supported by the community :heart: - however, they may be out of date with the officially supported releases.\n\n_Please note that the Debian package (previously supported by @rmescandon) is no longer maintained.

To encode a JSON file use: `base64 ~/<account_id>.json`. Or you can put a JSON structure to the secret.\n\n`PROJECT_ID` - must be provided to activate a specific project.\n\n### Using access tokens\n\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` to a valid OAUTH token; this allows the step to be used with [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions).\n\n```yaml\n- id: google_cloud_auth\n  name: Authenticate to Google Cloud\n  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1\n  with:\n    workload_identity_provider: \'projects/${{ secrets.gcp_project_number }}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${{ secrets.workload_identity_pool }/providers/${{ secrets.workload_identity_provider }}\'\n    service_account: \'${{ secrets.workload_identity_service_account }}@${{ secrets.gcp_project_name }}.iam.gserviceaccount.com\'\n    token_format: \'access_token\'\n\n- uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master\n  env:\n    PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.gcp_project_name }}\n    CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN: \'${{ steps.google_cloud_auth.outputs.access_token }}\'\n  with:\n    args: info\n```\n\nTwo important notes:\n\n1. If `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set, it will override any other auth configuration\n2. The `gsutil` command does not support the `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable; use [gcloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/storage) to interact with GCS.\n\n### Inputs\n\n`args` - command to run.\n\n`cli` - (optional) command line tool you want to use. Defaults to `gcloud`, allowed values: `gcloud`, `gsutil`.\n\n### Version\nFor each new release of gcloud master branch is updated to the latest version. Also, the tag is creating with the same number as the gcloud version. If you want to always have the latest version of gcloud, use `@master` branch. \nBut if you need some specific version of gcloud just use a specific tag. For example `@271.0.0`.\n\n## Example\n### Latest version\n```yaml\nname: gcloud\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    name: Deploy\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master\n        env:\n          PROJECT_ID: ${{secrets.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}}\n          APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ${{secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}}\n        with:\n          args: app deploy app.yaml\n```\n\n### Multistep\n```yaml\nname: gcloud\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    name: Deploy\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n      - name: ""deploy to project A""  \n        uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master\n        env:\n          PROJECT_ID: ${{secrets.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID_A}}\n          APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ${{secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}}\n        with:\n          args: app deploy app.yaml\n      \n      - name: ""deploy to project B""  \n        uses: actions-hub/gcloud@master\n        env:\n          PROJECT_ID: ${{secrets.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID_B}}\n        with:\n          args: app deploy app.yaml\n```\n\n### Specific version\n```yaml\nname: gcloud\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    name: Deploy\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - uses: actions-hub/gcloud@271.0.0\n        env:\n          PROJECT_ID: ${{secrets.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}}\n          APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ${{secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}}\n        with:\n          args: app deploy app.yaml\n```\n\n## Licence\n\n[MIT License](https://github.com/actions-hub/gcloud/blob/master/LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

575,"b'# \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa8 Deprecation notice \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa8\n\nGitHub has a new way to publish a static site to Pages using GitHub Actions. This means you can now build with the Jekyll command (or something else) and use actions to publish, all using regular steps. \nThis removes the need for Docker based actions and gives you all the freedom to configure the execution environment (versions of Ruby, extra dependencies...), it is a lot faster, easier to debug and closer to what you can run on your local machine. \n\nYou can check [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)\nfor more information on how to do this. \n\nMaintaining this action was a great experience, but as there is now a better solution availabe I do encourage everyone to move over. \n\n\n# jekyll-action\nA GitHub Action to build and publish Jekyll sites to GitHub Pages\n\nOut-of-the-box Jekyll with GitHub Pages allows you to leverage a limited, white-listed, set of gems. Complex sites requiring custom ones or non white-listed ones (AsciiDoc for instance) used to require a continuous integration build in order to pre-process the site.\n\nRemember that GitHub is serving your built static site, not its sources. So when configuring GitHub Pages in your project settings, use **gh-pages branch** as a Source for GitHub Pages. If you are setting up *username*.github.io repository, you\'ll have to use **master branch**, so sources can be located in another orphaned branch in the repo (which you can safely mark as default after the first publication).\nIn addition to that default behaviour, you can configure the branch this plugin pushes into with the `target_branch`-option. Keep in mind to set the source branch accordingly at the GitHub Pages Settings page.\n\nNote that this is a rather simple (naive maybe) Docker based action. @limjh16 has created [a JS based version of this action](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts) which saves the container download time and might help with non default use cases (such as but not limited to: specific package or library that is not available as a Gem).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a Jekyll site\nIf your repo doesn\'t already have one, create a new Jekyll site:  `jekyll new sample-site`. See [the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information. In this repo, we have created a site within a `sample_site` folder within the repository because the repository\'s main goal is not to be a website. If it was the case, we would have created the site at the root of the repository.\n\n### Create a `Gemfile`\nAs you are using this action to leverage specific Gems, well, you need to declare them! In the sample below we are using [the Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc)\n\n```Ruby\nsource \'https://rubygems.org\'\n\ngem \'jekyll\', \'~> 3.8.5\'\ngem \'coderay\', \'~> 1.1.0\'\n\ngroup :jekyll_plugins do\n  gem \'jekyll-asciidoc\', \'~> 2.1.1\'\nend\n\n```\n\n### Configure your Jekyll site\nEdit the configuration file of your Jekyll site (`_config.yml`) to leverage these plugins. In our sample, we want to leverage AsciiDoc so we added the following section:\n\n```yaml\nasciidoc: {}\nasciidoctor:\n  base_dir: :docdir\n  safe: unsafe\n  attributes:\n    - idseparator=_\n    - source-highlighter=coderay\n    - icons=font\n```\n\nNote that we also renamed `index.html` to `index.adoc` and modified this file accordingly in order to leverage AsciiDoc.\n\n### Create your publishing target\nThe historical default behavior of GitHub Pages is to deploy the content of a `gh-pages` branch. If you want to rely on this and you don\'t have such a branch yet, you can create it with the following instructions \n\n```\ngit switch --orphan gh-pages\ngit commit --allow-empty -m ""Initial commit on orphan branch""\ngit push -u origin gh-pages\n```\n\n### Use the action\nUse the `helaili/jekyll-action@master` action in your workflow file. It needs access to the out-of-the-box `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The directory where the Jekyll site lives will be detected (based on the location of `_config.yml`) but you can also explicitly set this directory by setting the `jekyll_src` parameter (`sample_site` for us). The `SRC` environment variable is also supported for backward compatibilty but it is deprecated.\nThe action will search for Gemfile location. If your want to specify it explicitly (e.g. if you have multiple Gemfiles per project), you should update `gem_src` input parameter accordingly.\n\nUse the `actions/cache` action in the workflow as well, to shorten build times and decrease load on GitHub\'s servers\n\n```yaml\nname: Testing the GitHub Pages publication\n\non:\n  push\n\njobs:\n  jekyll:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    # Use GitHub Actions\' cache to shorten build times and decrease load on servers\n    - uses: actions/cache@v2\n      with:\n        path: vendor/bundle\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles(\'**/Gemfile\') }}\n        restore-keys: |\n          ${{ runner.os }}-gems-\n\n    # Standard usage\n    - uses:  helaili/jekyll-action@v2\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n    # Specify the Jekyll source location as a parameter\n    - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@v2\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        jekyll_src: \'sample_site\'\n\n    # Specify the target branch (optional)\n    - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@v2\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        target_branch: \'gh-pages\'\n```\n\nUpon successful execution, the GitHub Pages publishing will happen automatically and will be listed on the *_environment_* tab of your repository.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2787414/51083469-31e29700-171b-11e9-8f10-8c02dd485f83.png)\n\nJust click on the *_View deployment_* button of the `github-pages` environment to navigate to your GitHub Pages site.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2787414/51083411-188d1b00-171a-11e9-9a25-f8b06f33053e.png)\n\n## Inputs\n\n### token\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. This is mandatory unless `build_only` is set to `true`. \n\n### jekyll_env\nThe Jekyll environment to build (default to `production`)\n\n### jekyll_src\nThe Jekyll website source directory\n\n### jekyll_build_options\nAdditional Jekyll build arguments (see [the Jekyll doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#build-command-options))\n\n### gem_src\nThe Jekyll Gemfile directory\n\n### target_branch\nThe target branch name the sources get pushed to\n\n### target_path:\nThe relative path where the site gets pushed to\n\n### build_only\nWhen set to `true`, the Jekyll site will be built but not published\n\n### build_dir\nThis is the directory which you want to build your site in\n\n### pre_build_commands\nCommands to run prior to build and deploy. Useful for ensuring build dependencies are up to date or installing new dependencies. For example, use `apk --update add imagemagick` to install ImageMagick.\n\n### keep_history \nWhen set to `true`, previous version of the site will be restored before the Jekyll build takes place. You can then use [the `keep_files` option](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#global-configuration) in your `_config.yml` file to select the files you want to keep. Make sure you then keep at least the `.git` folder. This option will also remove the `--force` flag from the `git commit...` command.  \n\n```yml\nkeep_files: [.git, hello.html]\n```\n\n### bundler_version\nWhen set override the default bundler version provided. If not given will attempt to resolve bundler version from `Gemfile.lock` if one exists.\n\n### commit_author\nWhen set override the default author of the commits to be performed. The default is to use the `GITHUB_ACTOR` environment variable, which is usually the owner of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The value can for example be set to `github-actions[bot]`. The corresponding email address is automatically set to `[commit_author]@users.noreply.github.com`.\n\n## Use case: multi version publishing \n\nSay you want to create a documentation website where you both have the current version (`v3.0`), but also `v1.0` and `v2.0`. You can then use a combination of `keep_history` and `target_path` along with the `actions/checkout@v2`action so that each version gets pushed in a separate folder without overwritting the previous one. \n\n```yaml \n... \n  publish-current-version: \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      with:\n        ref: main\n    - name: Run with dest path\n      uses: helaili/jekyll-build@v2\n      with:\n        target_branch: gh-pages\n        target_path: /\n        keep_history: true\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n  publish-v2-version: \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      with:\n        ref: v2.0\n    - name: Run with dest path\n      uses: helaili/jekyll-build@v2\n      with:\n        target_branch: gh-pages\n        target_path: v2.0\n        keep_history: true\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  \n  publish-v1-version: \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      with:\n        ref: v1.0\n    - name: Run with dest path\n      uses: helaili/jekyll-build@v2\n      with:\n        target_branch: gh-pages\n        target_path: v1.0        \n        keep_history: true\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Deprecation\nThis action previously used a `JEKYLL_PAT` environment variable instead of the `token` parameter. This is now deprecated. \n\n## I have a problem\nCreate a `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret with value `true` and run the workflow again. \n\n## Note on custom domains\nIf you\'re using a Custom Domain for your GitHub Pages site, you will need to ensure that the `CNAME` file exists in the repository root of the `main` (or `master`) branch so that it can be copied to the deployment root when your site is deployed.\n\nIf your GitHub Pages site is run off the `main` (or `master`) branch, you can modify the Custom Domain setting in the Repository Settings to automatically generate and commit the `CNAME` file.\n\nIf your GitHub Pages site is run off an _alternate_ branch, however, you will need to manually create and commit the `CNAME` file with your custom domain as its contents, otherwise the file will be committed to the deployment branch and _overwritten the next time the action is run_.\n\nNote that you can [force the inclusion of your CNAME file](https://github.com/criptowiki/criptowiki/issues/15#issuecomment-886890153)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

579,"b'# Post Slack messages\n\nThis action wraps the Slack [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API method for posting to channels, private groups, and DMs. This action sends messages using [Slack bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types), which have two main advantages compared to user tokens and incoming webhooks: (1) Bots can\'t be disabled inadvertently when a Slack user is disabled or removed. Slack has written about this in a [recent announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-latest-with-app-tokens-fe878d44130c), and (2) Bots offer a [powerful range of capabilities](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) that can be leveraged to perform more functions.\n\n## Usage:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Notify slack\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: pullreminders/slack-action@master\n  with:\n    args: \'{\\""channel\\"":\\""C1234567890\\"",\\""text\\"":\\""Hello world\\""}\'\n```\n\nHere\'s what the Slack message would look like:\n\n<img src=""docs/images/slack-message-example.png"" width=""540"">\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use this GitHub Action you\'ll first need to create a Slack App and install it to your Slack workspace.\n\n### Creating a Slack App\n\n1. **Create a Slack App**. Go to [Slack\'s developer site](https://api.slack.com/apps) then click ""Create an app"". Name the app ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and make sure your team\'s Slack workspace is selected under ""Development Slack Workspace"" ([see screenshot](docs/images/slack-app.png)).\n2. **Add a Bot user**. Browse to the ""Bot users"" page listed in the sidebar. Name your bot ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and leave the other default settings as-is ([see screenshot](docs/images/bot-user.png)).\n3. **Set an icon for your bot.** Browse to the ""Basic information"" page listed in the sidebar. Scroll down to the section titled ""Display information"" to set an icon. Feel free to use one of the [icons in this repository](docs/app-icons).\n4. **Install your app to your workspace.** At the top of the ""Basic information"" page you can find a section titled ""Install your app to your workspace"". Click on it, then use the button to complete the installation ([see screenshot](docs/images/install-slack-app.png)).\n\n## Using the action\n\nTo use this GitHub Action, you\'ll need to set a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secret on GitHub. To get your Slack bot token, browse to the ""OAuth & Permissions"" page listed in Slack and copy the ""Bot User OAuth Access Token"" beginning in `xoxb-`.\n\n### Posting messages\n\nSlack\'s [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) method accepts a JSON payload containing options \xe2\x80\x94 this JSON payload should be supplied as the argument in your GitHub Action. At a bare minimum, your payload must include a channel ID and the message. Here\'s what a basic message might look like:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Notify slack\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: pullreminders/slack-action@master\n  with:\n    args: \'{\\""channel\\"":\\""C1234567890\\"",\\""text\\"":\\""Hello world\\""}\'\n```\n\nPlease note that if you are using the visual editor you should not escape quotes because GitHub will automatically escape them for you.\n\n#### Channel IDs\n\nA ""channel ID"" can be the ID of a channel, private group, or user you would like to post a message to. Your bot can message any user in your Slack workspace but needs to be invited into channels and private groups before it can post to them.\n\nIf you open Slack in your web browser, you can find channel IDs at the end of the URL when viewing channels and private groups. Note that this doesn\'t work for direct messages.\n\n```\nhttps://myworkspace.slack.com/messages/CHANNEL_ID/\n```\n\nYou can also find channel IDs using the Slack API. Get a list of channels that your bot is a member of via Slack\'s [users.conversations](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.conversations) endpoint. Get user IDs for direct messages using Slack\'s [users.lookupByEmail](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.lookupByEmail) endpoint\n\nIf the channel is private, you\'ll need to install the App in that channel.\n\n#### Formatting messages\n\nPlease refer to [Slack\'s documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages) on message formatting. They also have a [message builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) that\'s great for playing around and previewing messages. Your messages can contain attachments, markdown, buttons, and more.\n\n## License\n\nThe Dockerfile and associated scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

583,"b'# Jekyll Builder for GitHub Pages (Action)\n\nFast and simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) based on the official [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/jekyll/docker) `builder` image for building a Jekyll site and optionally deploying that site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n\n* **Lightweight for fast builds.** The action\'s container image weighs in at ~80MB smaller than many comparable others.\n* **Minimal configuration.** Smart defaults are automatically pulled from your GitHub account via the [GitHub v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).\n* **Observable and debug-able**. Clear logs with plenty of hints for what to do when a commit breaks the build. Debug the action itself just by running it with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `""true""`.\n* **Batteries included**. Based on the official `jekyll/builder` Docker image so dependencies are always there when you need them.\n* **Automatic updates**. Never update your pipeline manually if you don\'t want to. If you do, specify a version-pinned ref in your workflow for guaranteed stability.\n* **Highlighy customizable**. Run custom commands before or after your build to easily smooth over any edge cases.\n* **Pipeline-ready.** Safe for Continuous Delivery workflows because only real issues, not no-ops, cause build errors. \n\nThis Action was created to be fast, simple, and versatile. It ships with smart defaults that are augmented at runtime with data pulled from the GitHub API, so you can keep your workflow file short and readable instead of spending time setting configuration inputs just to get the basics done. Use all the feautures of the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image and, if you need even more power, granting the action more privileges (by adding scopes to a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) used as the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable) will make it do more of the right things, automatically.\n\n# Usage\n\nIn one of your [GitHub Actions workflow files](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file), add the following as [a step in a job](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):\n\n```yaml\n- name: Build Jekyll site.\n  uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@v1 # Or whatever ""@ref"" you want.\n```\n\nThat\'s it. The action will use whatever source code is checked out from a previous [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) step as the Jekyll source to build. If the build succeeds, the step passes and the job continues with the next step.\n\nFor more details, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-actions-from-github-marketplace-in-your-workflow). For more common use cases, notably deploying to GitHub Pages, see [\xc2\xa7 Examples](#examples).\n\n## Choosing a ref\n\nUse the following guidance when choosing which ref (version) you want to base your work on:\n\n* `v1` - This references the latest available 1.x.x version of the Action, which conforms with semantic versioning compatibility conventions. Use this ref in your workflow to gain backwards-compatible enhancements automatically. These versions will all be based on the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image\'s `latest` tag.\n* `builder-3.8` - This reference is based on `jekyll/builder:3.8` and is considered a stable, legacy release. Use this ref in your workflow to stick to the given upstream tag.\n\n## Inputs\n\nYou can customize this action by [using input variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).  Moreover,  *all inputs are optional*, so the action will still build your Jekyll site without any additional configuration. To enable deployments to GitHub Pages and other advanced features, some inputs are required as described below.\n\nFor additional details, inputs are well-commented in [the action\'s metadata file (`action.yaml`)](action.yaml).\n\n### `gh_pages_publishing_source`\n\nName of the branch your repository is using as its GitHub Pages publishing source. This is the branch in your GitHub repository to which the Action will commit the result of the Jekyll build. Note that to deploy on GitHub Pages, you *must* first enable GitHub Pages from your repository\'s Settings screen and choose a GitHub Pages publishing source branch before using this Action.\n\nWhen GitHub Pages is enabled, User and Organization repositories reserve the `master` branch as the GitHub Pages publishing source. This means you *must not* keep your own source code files in the `master` branch of User or Organization repositories when using this Action to automate deployments to GitHub Pages.\n\nBy default, this value is detected automatically if you have already [configured a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) in your repository settings and provided a [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable with appropriate permissions.\n\nThis option is ignored when the Action detects a [User or Organization repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites), because those types of GitHub Pages sites can only ever use their `master` branch as a publishing source. For Project repositories, this defaults to the value set in your repository\'s Settings screen (e.g., `gh-pages` branch).\n\n### `git_commit_message`\n\nWhen a commit to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch ([`gh_pages_publishing_source`](#gh_pages_publishing_source)) is made, this input variable defines the message to use. If none is specified, a generic default message will be used.\n\n### `git_committer_email`\n\nThe email address to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the email associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow if the access token passed as the [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable has permission to access that data. If not, it will default to `""${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com""`.\n\n### `git_committer_name`\n\nThe name to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the display name associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n### `jekyll_build_opts`\n\nExtra arguments to pass to [the `jekyll build` command](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). This is particularly useful if your site requires non-default Jekyll build behaviors to be enabled. For example, to publish future-dated posts on your blog:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    jekyll_build_opts: --future\n```\n\nSee the output of `jekyll build --help` for more options.\n\n### `pre_build_commands`\n\nSet this input variable to a shell command or short inline shell script, which will be executed prior to the build. This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.\n\nFor example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    # Use a newer `bundle` command.\n    pre_build_commands: gem install bundler\n```\n\nA more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    pre_build_commands: |\n      echo ""Packaged bundler version: $(bundle --version)""\n      echo ""Updating bundler...""\n      gem install bundler\n```\n\n### `post_build_commands`\n\nExactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.\n\n### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`\n\nSet this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.\n\nYou should always set this input variable by using the `secrets` expression context provided by GitHub Actions runners:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_VARIABLE }}\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).\n\n## Outputs\n\n> :construction: TODO\n\nThe current version of this action does not produce any outputs. Hopefully, a future version will. :)\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section offers some complete workflow examples to show you how to make use of this action.\n\n### Deploying to GitHub Pages\n\nBy default, when the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable is set, the action will deploy the Jekyll build to the GitHub Pages publishing source branch configured in your repository\'s GitHub Pages Settings section. This means you must first [configure a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) before using this action to deploy a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.\n\nThis input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token). Then navigate to your repository\'s Settings &rarr; Secrets screen and add a new secret whose value is exactly the same as the personal access token you created moments earlier. In the example configuration below, we assume you have created a repository secret named `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`.\n\n```yaml\n# In your repository\'s `.github/workflows/publish-to-github-pages.yaml` file.\n---\n# Name of your GitHub Actions workflow.\nname: Publish to GitHub Pages\n\n# Specifies to run this workflow whenever a push is made (commits are\n# added) to the branch named `jekyll`.\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n\n# Define a job named `build-and-publish` in your workflow.\njobs:\n  build-and-publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job uses a GitHub-hosted runner.\n\n    steps:\n      # Checkout the source from the `jekyll` branch.\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      # Invoke this action against the newly checked out source code.\n      - uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n        with:\n          # Provide this action with your repository\'s `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`\n          # ""Secret"" variable. This should be the value of a personal\n          # access token granted, at a minimum, the `public_repo` and\n          # the `repo_deployment` scopes needed to deploy to GH Pages.\n          secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nUsing the above workflow file, anytime someone with the appropriate permissions pushes to the `jekyll` branch in your repository, this action will run. The `build-and-publish` job will `git checkout` the `jekyll` branch source code, which should contain your Jekyll site\'s source (not your generated HTML). Assuming the secret `GH_PAGES_TOKEN` contains a personal access token granted the sufficient permissions, the action will automatically detect the correct branch to `git commit` and `git push` your generated HTML to.\n\n#### Automatically rebuilding a GitHub Pages site\n\nYou can schedule your workflow to run this action in order to keep your (otherwise static) GitHub Pages site content fresh This is particularly useful if your Jekyll templates show different content based on the date or time of the build, such as featuring your organization\'s next calendar event on the site\'s home page. Enable scheduled builds by adding a `schedule` key in the `on` dictionary from the above example:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  # Automatically execute this workflow on a schedule.\n  schedule:\n    # POSIX-compatible cron syntax is supported.\n    - cron:  \'0 */12 * * *\' # Rebuild twice a day (every twelve hours on the hour).\n\n  # Also run this workflow whenever pushes are made to these branches, as before.\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n```\n\nSee [Events that trigger workflows \xc2\xa7 Scheduled events: `schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) for more information.\n\n# Support and Donations\n\nContributions are &hearts;ily welcomed.\n\nIn addition to contributing code, please consider sending some $ my way by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/fabacab/), at least until grocery stores begin offering free food. Donations for this and my other Free Software projects make up the bulk of my income.

This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.\n\nFor example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    # Use a newer `bundle` command.\n    pre_build_commands: gem install bundler\n```\n\nA more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    pre_build_commands: |\n      echo ""Packaged bundler version: $(bundle --version)""\n      echo ""Updating bundler...""\n      gem install bundler\n```\n\n### `post_build_commands`\n\nExactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.\n\n### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`\n\nSet this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.\n\nYou should always set this input variable by using the `secrets` expression context provided by GitHub Actions runners:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_VARIABLE }}\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).\n\n## Outputs\n\n> :construction: TODO\n\nThe current version of this action does not produce any outputs. Hopefully, a future version will. :)\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section offers some complete workflow examples to show you how to make use of this action.\n\n### Deploying to GitHub Pages\n\nBy default, when the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable is set, the action will deploy the Jekyll build to the GitHub Pages publishing source branch configured in your repository\'s GitHub Pages Settings section. This means you must first [configure a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) before using this action to deploy a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.\n\nThis input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token). Then navigate to your repository\'s Settings &rarr; Secrets screen and add a new secret whose value is exactly the same as the personal access token you created moments earlier. In the example configuration below, we assume you have created a repository secret named `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`.\n\n```yaml\n# In your repository\'s `.github/workflows/publish-to-github-pages.yaml` file.\n---\n# Name of your GitHub Actions workflow.\nname: Publish to GitHub Pages\n\n# Specifies to run this workflow whenever a push is made (commits are\n# added) to the branch named `jekyll`.\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n\n# Define a job named `build-and-publish` in your workflow.\njobs:\n  build-and-publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job uses a GitHub-hosted runner.\n\n    steps:\n      # Checkout the source from the `jekyll` branch.\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      # Invoke this action against the newly checked out source code.\n      - uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n        with:\n          # Provide this action with your repository\'s `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`\n          # ""Secret"" variable. This should be the value of a personal\n          # access token granted, at a minimum, the `public_repo` and\n          # the `repo_deployment` scopes needed to deploy to GH Pages.\n          secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nUsing the above workflow file, anytime someone with the appropriate permissions pushes to the `jekyll` branch in your repository, this action will run. The `build-and-publish` job will `git checkout` the `jekyll` branch source code, which should contain your Jekyll site\'s source (not your generated HTML). Assuming the secret `GH_PAGES_TOKEN` contains a personal access token granted the sufficient permissions, the action will automatically detect the correct branch to `git commit` and `git push` your generated HTML to.\n\n#### Automatically rebuilding a GitHub Pages site\n\nYou can schedule your workflow to run this action in order to keep your (otherwise static) GitHub Pages site content fresh This is particularly useful if your Jekyll templates show different content based on the date or time of the build, such as featuring your organization\'s next calendar event on the site\'s home page. Enable scheduled builds by adding a `schedule` key in the `on` dictionary from the above example:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  # Automatically execute this workflow on a schedule.\n  schedule:\n    # POSIX-compatible cron syntax is supported.\n    - cron:  \'0 */12 * * *\' # Rebuild twice a day (every twelve hours on the hour).\n\n  # Also run this workflow whenever pushes are made to these branches, as before.\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n```\n\nSee [Events that trigger workflows \xc2\xa7 Scheduled events: `schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) for more information.\n\n# Support and Donations\n\nContributions are &hearts;ily welcomed.\n\nIn addition to contributing code, please consider sending some $ my way by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/fabacab/), at least until grocery stores begin offering free food. Donations for this and my other Free Software projects make up the bulk of my income.

587,"b'# cancel-previous-runs \nThis action cancels previous runs for one or more branches/prs associated with a workflow, effectively limiting the resource consumption of the workflow to one per branch.\n\n#### NOTE: This action was created before [concurrency groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency). In most cases you want to define a cancel-in-progress group instead of using this action.\n\n<p><a href=""https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions""><img alt=""typescript-action status"" src=""https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg""></a>\n\n## Usage\n\nThe easiest and most complete approach to utilize this action, is to create a separate schedule event triggered workflow, which is directed at the workflow you wish to clear duplicate runs. At each cron interval all branches and all PRs executing for either push or pull_request events will be processed and limited to one run per branch/pr.\n\nAdditionally this action can be placed as an early step in your workflow (e.g. after checkout), so that it can abort the other previously running jobs immediately, in case most resources are tied up. Unfortunately this approach is a no-op when a pull request uses a fork for a source branch. This is because the GITHUB_TOKEN provided to runs with a fork source branch specifies reed-only permissions for security reasons. write permissions are required to be able to cancel a job. Therefore, it\'s a good idea to only rely on this approach as a fallback in-addition to the previously described scheduling model. \n\n### Inputs\n\ntoken - The github token passed from `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Since workflow files are visible in the repository, **DO NOT HARDCODE A TOKEN ONLY USE A REFERENCE**. \nworkflow - The filename of the workflow to limit runs on (only applies to schedule events) \n\n\n### Schedule Example\n\n```yaml\nname: Cleanup Duplicate Branches and PRs  \non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron:  \'*/15 * * * *\'\ncancel-runs:\n  # Prevent forks from running this to be nice\n  if: github.repository == \'foo-org/my-repo\'\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: n1hility/cancel-previous-runs@v3\n        with: \n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          workflow: my-heavy-workflow.yml\n```\n\n\n### Alternate/Fallback Example\n\n```yaml\n  test: \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n    - uses: n1hility/cancel-previous-runs@v3\n      with: \n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## License\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Your workflows run in response to events and are triggered independently and without coordination. In a shared repository, if two or more people merge pull requests, each will trigger workflows without regard to one another.\n\nThis can be problematic for workflows used as part of a continuous deployment process. You might want to let an in-flight deployment complete before progressing further with the next workflow. This is the usecase turnstyle action targets.\n\n## \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb8 Usage\n\nThe typical setup for turnstyle involves adding job step using `softprops/turnstyle@v1`.\n\n```diff\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n+     - name: Turnstyle\n+       uses: softprops/turnstyle@v1\n+       env:\n+         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Deploy\n        run: sleep 30\n```\n\n### Timing out\n\nTo avoid waiting prolonged periods of time, you may wish to bail on a run or continuing a workflow run regardless of the status of the previous run.\n\nYou can bail from a run using the built-in GitHub Actions [`jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) setting\n\n```diff\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  main:\n+   timeout-minutes: 5\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Turnstyle\n        uses: softprops/turnstyle@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Deploy\n        run: sleep 30\n```\n\nYou can also limit how long you\'re willing to wait before moving on with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.continue-after-seconds`\n\n```diff\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Turnstyle\n        uses: softprops/turnstyle@v1\n        with:\n+         continue-after-seconds: 180\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Deploy\n        run: sleep 30\n```\n\nor before aborting the step with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.abort-after-seconds`\n\n\n```diff\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Turnstyle\n        uses: softprops/turnstyle@v1\n        with:\n+         abort-after-seconds: 180\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Deploy\n        run: sleep 30\n```\n\nFinally, you can use the `force_continued` output to skip only a subset of steps\nby setting `continue-after-seconds` and conditioning future steps with\n`if: ! steps.<step id>.outputs.force_continued`\n\n\n```diff\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Turnstyle\n        id: turnstyle\n        uses: softprops/turnstyle@v1\n        with:\n+         continue-after-seconds: 180\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Deploy\n+       if: ! steps.turnstyle.outputs.force_continued\n        run: sleep 30\n```\n\n#### inputs\n\n| Name                    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `continue-after-seconds`| number  | Maximum number of seconds to wait before moving forward (unbound by default).

Note that\ndevelopment requires at least [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to be installed on your computer.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/dev-drprasad/delete-tag-and-release.git\ncd delete-tag-and-release\nnpm install\n```\n\nTests can be run via:\n\n```shell\nnpm test\n```\n\nSince this is a repo for a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), **every new commit that changes code must include a new bundle.** You can \ngenerate a new bundle via running:\n\n```shell\nnpm run package\n```\n\nand committing the resulting changes that will be in the `dist/` folder.\n\n### Formatting and linting\n\nThis project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for source code formatting. You can run the lint checks by running:\n\n```shell\nnpm run lint\n```\n\nIf you have lint errors that are automatically fixable, you can fix those by running:\n\n```shell\nnpm run lint:fix\n```\n\n## Releasing\n\nReleases are done by creating a new tag and pushing that tag to the repo. A new\nrelease can be made via the following:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout master\ngit fetch\ngit pull\n# choose either patch, minor, or major. See https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version#description for more info\nnpm version <patch/minor/major>\ngit push --follow-tags\n```\n\nThis will update the version in the `package.json`, create a new commit based off of the master branch, and create a \nnew Git tag with that version that points to the new commit. Remember to use the `--follow-tags` flag when running \n`git push`! Without it, the new tag won't be pushed.\n\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Get it via command: `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.\n- **HOST**: The host or IP of the Dokku server. ie, `your.site.com` or `192.168.1.1`.\n- **PROJECT**: Dokku project name.\n\n### Optional Environments\n\nYou can optionally provide the following:\n\n- **PORT**: Port of the sshd listen to, `22` is set by default.\n- **FORCE_DEPLOY**: Force push the project to dokku, e.g. `FORCE_DEPLOY=true`\n- **HOST_KEY**: The results of running `ssh-keyscan -t rsa $HOST`. Use this if you want to check that the host you're deploying to is the right one (e.g. has the same keys).\n- **APP_CONFIG**: Set dokku config through github secrets. Example: `RAILS_MAX_THREADS=25 SECRET_KEY_BASE=xyz123&$%`.\n- **BRANCH**: The ability to deploy from a non-master branch.\n\n## License\n\nThe Dockerfile and associated scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Here\xe2\x80\x99s an exemplary GitHub Action using a Redis server in versions 4 and 5 to test a Node.js app:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Git checkout\r\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n\r\n    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\r\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v1\r\n      with:\r\n        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\r\n\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n\r\n    - run: npm install\r\n\r\n    - run: npm test\r\n      env:\r\n        CI: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using a Custom Redis Image\r\nYou can utilize an alternative Redis image using the `redis-image` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6.2.4-v4, 6.2.6-v3]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-image: redis/redis-stack-server\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using Redis on a Custom Port\r\nYou can start the Redis instance on a custom port using the `redis-port` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-port: 12345\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using a Custom Container Name\r\nThis GitHub Action provides a Redis Docker container. The default container name is `redis`. It can be helpful to customize the container name. For example, when running multiple Redis instances in parallel. You can customize the container name using the `redis-container-name` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-container-name: redis-auth-token-cache\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remove container when exit\r\nStarting in v1.6.0, when running this action on a self-hosted runner, it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to remove the container so its name won\xe2\x80\x99t conflict:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-remove-container: true # false by default\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT \xc2\xa9 [Supercharge](https://superchargejs.com)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> [superchargejs.com](https://superchargejs.com) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;\r\n> GitHub [@supercharge](https://github.com/supercharge) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;\r\n> Twitter [@superchargejs](https://twitter.com/superchargejs)\r\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

An [example workflow](#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n### Inputs\n\n- `path`: The path the action can find the CHANGELOG. Optional. Defaults to `./CHANGELOG.md`.\n- `version`: The [exact version](https://semver.org) of the log entry you want to retreive or ""Unreleased"" for the unreleased entry. Optional. Defaults to the last version number.\n- `validation_level`: Specifies at which level the validation system is set. Can be \'none\', \'warn\', \'error\'. Optional. Defaults to `none`.\n- `validation_depth`: Specifies how many entries to validate in the CHANGELOG.md file. Optional. Defaults to `0`.\n\n### Outputs\n\n- `version`: Version of the log entry found. Ex: `2.0.0`.\n- `date`: Release date of the log entry found. Ex: `2020-08-22`.\n- `status`: Status of the log entry found (`prereleased`, `released`, `unreleased`, or `yanked`).\n- `changes`: Description text of the log entry found.\n\n### Validation / Linting\n\nA validation engine is available in _Changelog Reader_. It is by default disabled but can be enabled by setting `validation_level` at \'warn\' or \'error\'.\n\nThe validation engine will enforce [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) standards as well as [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) standards and formatting. **If your project doesn\'t follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 or Keep a Changelog, do not enable the validation engine.** It might your build unnecessarily.\n\nYou can utilize the `validation_depth` input param to specify how many entries to validate. Changelog Reader will by default validates only the last 10 changelog entries.\n\nWhen `validation_level` is set at \'warn\', Changelog Reader will print check results as warnings in your logs without breaking your build.\nWhen `validation_level` is set at \'error\', Changelog Reader will print check results as errors in your logs and will throw an error to prevent the build to go further.\n\n### Example workflow - create a release from changelog\n\nOn every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) using the CHANGELOG.md content.\nThis Workflow example assumes you\'ll use the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) Action to create the release step:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags\n    tags:\n      - \'v*\' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10\n\nname: Create Release\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Create Release\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Get version from tag\n        id: tag_name\n        run: |\n          echo ::set-output name=current_version::${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}\n        shell: bash\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Get Changelog Entry\n        id: changelog_reader\n        uses: mindsers/changelog-reader-action@v2\n        with:\n          validation_level: warn\n          version: ${{ steps.tag_name.outputs.current_version }}\n          path: ./CHANGELOG.md\n      - name: Create/update release\n        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1\n        with:\n          # This pulls from the ""Get Changelog Entry"" step above, referencing it\'s ID to get its outputs object.\n          # See this blog post for more info: https://jasonet.co/posts/new-features-of-github-actions/#passing-data-to-future-steps\n          tag: ${{ steps.changelog_reader.outputs.version }}\n          name: Release ${{ steps.changelog_reader.outputs.version }}\n          body: ${{ steps.changelog_reader.outputs.changes }}\n          prerelease: ${{ steps.changelog_reader.outputs.status == \'prereleased\' }}\n          draft: ${{ steps.changelog_reader.outputs.status == \'unreleased\' }}\n          allowUpdates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nContributions to the source code of _Changelog Reader Action_ are welcomed and greatly appreciated.\nFor help on how to contribute in this project, please refer to [How to contribute to Changelog Reader Action](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo see the project\'s list of **awesome contributors**, please refer to our [Contributors Wall](CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n\n## Support\n\n_Changelog Reader Action_ is licensed under an MIT license, which means that it\'s a completely free open source software.

610,"b'# Cache action\n\nThis action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.\n\n>Two other actions are available in addition to the primary `cache` action:\n>* [Restore action](./restore/README.md)\n>* [Save action](./save/README.md)\n\n[![Tests](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [""Caching dependencies to speed up workflows""](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).\n\n## What\'s New\n\n### v3\n\n* Added support for caching in GHES 3.5+.\n* Fixed download issue for files > 2GB during restore.\n* Updated the minimum runner version support from node 12 -> node 16.\n* Fixed avoiding empty cache save when no files are available for caching.\n* Fixed tar creation error while trying to create tar with path as `~/` home folder on `ubuntu-latest`.\n* Fixed zstd failing on amazon linux 2.0 runners.\n* Fixed cache not working with github workspace directory or current directory.\n* Fixed the download stuck problem by introducing a timeout of 1 hour for cache downloads.\n* Fix zstd not working for windows on gnu tar in issues.\n* Allowing users to provide a custom timeout as input for aborting download of a cache segment using an environment variable `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS`. Default is 10 minutes.\n* New actions are available for granular control over caches - [restore](restore/action.yml) and [save](save/action.yml).\n* Support cross-os caching as an opt-in feature. See [Cross OS caching](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) for more info.\n* Added option to fail job on cache miss. See [Exit workflow on cache miss](./restore/README.md#exit-workflow-on-cache-miss) for more info.\n* Fix zstd not being used after zstd version upgrade to 1.5.4 on hosted runners\n* Added option to lookup cache without downloading it.\n* Reduced segment size to 128MB and segment timeout to 10 minutes to fail fast in case the cache download is stuck.\n\nSee the [v2 README.md](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/v2/README.md) for older updates.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your repository\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-cache-workflow) is available below. For more information, see the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\nIf you are using this inside a container, a POSIX-compliant `tar` needs to be included and accessible from the execution path.\n\nIf you are using a `self-hosted` Windows runner, `GNU tar` and `zstd` are required for [Cross-OS caching](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) to work. They are also recommended to be installed in general so the performance is on par with `hosted` Windows runners.\n\n### Inputs\n\n* `key` - An explicit key for a cache entry. See [creating a cache key](#creating-a-cache-key).\n* `path` - A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore. See [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns.\n* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of prefix-matched keys to use for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key.\n* `enableCrossOsArchive` - An optional boolean when enabled, allows Windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms. Default: `false`\n* `fail-on-cache-miss` - Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found. Default: `false`\n* `lookup-only` - If true, only checks if cache entry exists and skips download. Does not change save cache behavior. Default: `false`\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n* `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS` - Segment download timeout (in minutes, default `10`) to abort download of the segment if not completed in the defined number of minutes. [Read more](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)\n\n### Outputs\n\n* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key.\n\n    > **Note** `cache-hit` will only be set to `true` when a cache hit occurs for the exact `key` match. For a partial key match via `restore-keys` or a cache miss, it will be set to `false`.\n\nSee [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output\n\n### Cache scopes\n\nThe cache is scoped to the key, [version](#cache-version), and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches.\n\nSee [Matching a cache key](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key) for more info.\n\n### Example cache workflow\n\n#### Restoring and saving cache using a single action\n\n```yaml\nname: Caching Primes\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Cache Primes\n      id: cache-primes\n      uses: actions/cache@v3\n      with:\n        path: prime-numbers\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-primes\n\n    - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n      if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n      run: /generate-primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n\n    - name: Use Prime Numbers\n      run: /primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n```\n\nThe `cache` action provides a `cache-hit` output which is set to `true` when the cache is restored using the primary `key` and `false` when the cache is restored using `restore-keys` or no cache is restored.\n\n#### Using a combination of restore and save actions\n\n```yaml\nname: Caching Primes\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Restore cached Primes\n      id: cache-primes-restore\n      uses: actions/cache/restore@v3\n      with:\n        path: |\n          path/to/dependencies\n          some/other/dependencies\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-primes\n    .\n    . //intermediate workflow steps\n    .\n    - name: Save Primes\n      id: cache-primes-save\n      uses: actions/cache/save@v3\n      with:\n        path: |\n          path/to/dependencies\n          some/other/dependencies\n        key: ${{ steps.cache-primes-restore.outputs.cache-primary-key }}\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> You must use the `cache` or `restore` action in your workflow before you need to use the files that might be restored from the cache. If the provided `key` matches an existing cache, a new cache is not created and if the provided `key` doesn\'t match an existing cache, a new cache is automatically created provided the job completes successfully.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nWith the introduction of the `restore` and `save` actions, a lot of caching use cases can now be achieved. Please see the [caching strategies](./caching-strategies.md) document for understanding how you can use the actions strategically to achieve the desired goal.\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\nEvery programming language and framework has its own way of caching.\n\nSee [Examples](examples.md) for a list of `actions/cache` implementations for use with:\n\n* [C# - NuGet](./examples.md#c---nuget)\n* [Clojure - Lein Deps](./examples.md#clojure---lein-deps)\n* [D - DUB](./examples.md#d---dub)\n* [Deno](./examples.md#deno)\n* [Elixir - Mix](./examples.md#elixir---mix)\n* [Go - Modules](./examples.md#go---modules)\n* [Haskell - Cabal](./examples.md#haskell---cabal)\n* [Haskell - Stack](./examples.md#haskell---stack)\n* [Java - Gradle](./examples.md#java---gradle)\n* [Java - Maven](./examples.md#java---maven)\n* [Node - npm](./examples.md#node---npm)\n* [Node - Lerna](./examples.md#node---lerna)\n* [Node - Yarn](./examples.md#node---yarn)\n* [OCaml/Reason - esy](./examples.md#ocamlreason---esy)\n* [PHP - Composer](./examples.md#php---composer)\n* [Python - pip](./examples.md#python---pip)\n* [Python - pipenv](./examples.md#python---pipenv)\n* [R - renv](./examples.md#r---renv)\n* [Ruby - Bundler](./examples.md#ruby---bundler)\n* [Rust - Cargo](./examples.md#rust---cargo)\n* [Scala - SBT](./examples.md#scala---sbt)\n* [Swift, Objective-C - Carthage](./examples.md#swift-objective-c---carthage)\n* [Swift, Objective-C - CocoaPods](./examples.md#swift-objective-c---cocoapods)\n* [Swift - Swift Package Manager](./examples.md#swift---swift-package-manager)\n* [Swift - Mint](./examples.md#swift---mint)\n\n## Creating a cache key\n\nA cache key can include any of the contexts, functions, literals, and operators supported by GitHub Actions.\n\nFor example, using the [`hashFiles`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#hashfiles) function allows you to create a new cache when dependencies change.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    with:\n      path: |\n        path/to/dependencies\n        some/other/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use arbitrary command output in a cache key, such as a date or software version:\n\n```yaml\n  # http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html\n  - name: Get Date\n    id: get-date\n    run: |\n      echo ""date=$(/bin/date -u ""+%Y%m%d"")"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n    shell: bash\n\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    with:\n      path: path/to/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ steps.get-date.outputs.date }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n```\n\nSee [Using contexts to create cache keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#using-contexts-to-create-cache-keys)\n\n## Cache Limits\n\nA repository can have up to 10GB of caches. Once the 10GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.\n\n## Skipping steps based on cache-hit\n\nUsing the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.  It is recommended to install missing/updated dependencies in case of a partial key match when the key is dependent on the `hash` of the package file.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    id: cache\n    with:\n      path: path/to/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n\n  - name: Install Dependencies\n    if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n    run: /install.sh\n```\n\n> **Note** The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)\n\n## Cache Version\n\nCache version is a hash [generated](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/500d0b42fee2552ae9eeb5933091fe2fbf14e72d/packages/cache/src/internal/cacheHttpClient.ts#L73-L90) for a combination of compression tool used (Gzip, Zstd, etc. based on the runner OS) and the `path` of directories being cached. If two caches have different versions, they are identified as unique caches while matching. This, for example, means that a cache created on a `windows-latest` runner can\'t be restored on `ubuntu-latest` as cache `Version`s are different.\n\n> Pro tip: The [list caches](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache#list-github-actions-caches-for-a-repository) API can be used to get the version of a cache. This can be helpful to troubleshoot cache miss due to version.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Example</summary>\nThe workflow will create 3 unique caches with same keys. Ubuntu and windows runners will use different compression technique and hence create two different caches. And `build-linux` will create two different caches as the `paths` are different.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build-linux:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cache Primes\n        id: cache-primes\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: prime-numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n\n      - name: Cache Numbers\n        id: cache-numbers\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-numbers.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes.sh -d numbers\n\n  build-windows:\n    runs-on: windows-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cache Primes\n        id: cache-primes\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: prime-numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes -d prime-numbers\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Known practices and workarounds\n\nThere are a number of community practices/workarounds to fulfill specific requirements. You may choose to use them if they suit your use case. Note these are not necessarily the only solution or even a recommended solution.\n\n* [Cache segment restore timeout](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)\n* [Update a cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#update-a-cache)\n* [Use cache across feature branches](./tips-and-workarounds.md#use-cache-across-feature-branches)\n* [Cross OS cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache)\n* [Force deletion of caches overriding default cache eviction policy](./tips-and-workarounds.md#force-deletion-of-caches-overriding-default-cache-eviction-policy)\n\n### Windows environment variables\n\nPlease note that Windows environment variables (like `%LocalAppData%`) will NOT be expanded by this action. Instead, prefer using `~` in your paths which will expand to the HOME directory. For example, instead of `%LocalAppData%`, use `~\\AppData\\Local`. For a list of supported default environment variables, see the [Learn GitHub Actions: Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) page.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would love for you to contribute to `actions/cache`.

611,"b'# github action maven release\n\nThe GitHub Action for Maven releases wraps the Maven CLI to enable Maven release to be run by a bot.\nYou can use this action for auto-releasing your java artefacts each time you commit into master.\n\nThe release will allow you to setup a GPG key for your bot.\n\n# Usage\n\n## Maven release\n\nFor a simple repo with not much protection and private dependency, you can do:\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master\n      with:\n        release-branch-name: ""master""\n\n        git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""\n        git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""\n\n        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n```\nYou can add some maven options, which is handy for skipping tests:\n```\n        maven-args: ""-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip""\n```\n\nIf you want to setup a GPG key, you can do it by injecting your key via the secrets:\n\nNote: `GITHUB_GPG_KEY` needs to be base64 encoded.\nif you haven\'t setup a GPG key yet, see next section\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master\n      with:\n        release-branch-name: ""master""\n        gpg-enabled: ""true""\n        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}\n        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}\n\n        git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""\n        git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""\n\n        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n\nIf you got a private maven repo to setup in the settings.xml, you can do:\nNote: we recommend putting those values in your repo secrets.\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master\n      with:\n        release-branch-name: ""master""\n\n        maven-repo-server-id: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}\n        maven-repo-server-username: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}\n        maven-repo-server-password: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_PASSWORD }}\n\n        git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""\n        git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""\n\n        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nHere is an example with all of the options at the same time:\n\n```\n - name: Release\n      uses: qcastel/github-actions-maven-release@master\n      with:\n        release-branch-name: ""master""\n\n        gpg-enabled: ""true""\n        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}\n        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}\n\n        maven-repo-server-id: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}\n        maven-repo-server-username: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_USER }}\n        maven-repo-server-password: ${{ secrets.MVN_REPO_PRIVATE_REPO_PASSWORD }}\n\n        maven-args: ""-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -DskipITs -Ddockerfile.skip -DdockerCompose.skip""\n\n        git-release-bot-name: ""release-bot""\n        git-release-bot-email: ""release-bot@example.com""\n\n        access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nYou may also be in the case where you got more than one maven projects inside the repo. We added an option that will make the release job move to the according directy before running the release:\n\n```\n        maven-project-folder: ""sub-folder/""\n```\n\nWe welcome contributions! If your usecase is slightly different than us, just suggest a RFE or contribute to this repo directly.\n\n## Setup the bot gpg key\n\nSetting up a gpg key for your bot is a good security feature. This way, you can enforce sign commits in your repo,\neven for your release bot.\n\n![Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9F6cxpqm/Screenshot-2019-11-28-at-20-47-06.png)\n\n- Create dedicate github account for your bot and add him into your team for your git repo.\n- Create a new GPG key: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key\n\nThis github action needs the key ID and the key base64 encoded.\n\n```$xslt\n        gpg-key-id: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY_ID }}\n        gpg-key: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_GPG_KEY }}\n```\n\n### Get the KID\n\nYou can get the key ID doing the following:\n\n```$xslt\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG\n\nsec   rsa2048/3EFC3104C0088B08 2019-11-28 [SC]\n      CBFD9020DAC388A77C68385C3EFC3104C0088B08\nuid                 [ultimate] bot-openbanking4-dev (it\'s the bot openbanking4.dev key) <bot@openbanking4.dev>\nssb   rsa2048/7D1523C9952204C1 2019-11-28 [E]\n\n```\nThe key ID for my bot is 3EFC3104C0088B08.

For example `/.` or `path/to/home.md`.||\n|`dst_path`|Optional|The destination path to copy the file(s) or folder(s) to. For example `/wiki/` or `path/to/index.md`. |`src_path`|\n|`dst_owner`|Required|The name of the owner of the repository to push to. For example `andstor`.||\n|`dst_repo_name`|Required|The name of the repository to push to. For example `copycat-action`.||\n|`src_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in source repository to clone from.|`master`|\n|`dst_branch`|Optional|The name of the branch in the destination repository to push to. If the branch doesn\'t exists, the branch will be created based on the default branch.|`master`|\n|`clean`|Optional|Set to `true` if the `dst_path` should be emptied before copying.|`false`|\n|`file_filter`|Optional|A simple [pattern](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching) for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file basename. For example `*.sh`.||\n|`filter`|Optional|A glob pattern for filtering files to be copied. Acts on file paths. For example `**/!(*.*)`.||\n|`exclude`|Optional|A glob pattern for excluding paths. For example `*/tests/*`.||\n|`src_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the source repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.| `false`|\n|`dst_wiki`|Optional|Set to `true` if the destination repository you want to copy from is the GitHub Wiki.|`false`|\n|`commit_message`|Optional|A custom git commit message.||\n|`username`|Optional|The GitHub username to associate commits made by this GitHub action.|[`GITHUB_ACTOR`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables)|\n|`email`|Optional|The email used for associating commits made by this GitHub action.|[`GITHUB_ACTOR`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables) `@users.noreply.github.com`|\n\n## Secrets\n\n* `personal_token`: (required) GitHub Private Access Token used for the clone/push operations. To create it follow the [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).\n\n## Filtering\nCopycat provides several ways of filtering which files you want to copy.  \nAll three types of filtering can be applied simultaneously.\n\n### Input variables\n#### `file_filter`\nThe `file_filter`input variable allows you to filter file basenames. Hence, you can for example only copy all text files by setting `file_filter`to `*.txt`. The variable only accepts simple [patterns](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Shell-Pattern-Matching).\n\n#### `filter`\nThe `filter` input variable provides extensive globbing support. It also supports extended globbing and globstar. The globbing applies to file paths. So, to for example match all files that doesn\'t have a file extention, the pattern could look like `**/!(*.*)`.\n\n#### `exclude`\nThe `exclude` input variable can be used to exclude certain paths. It will apply to the file paths. One are for example able to exclude certain deirectory names. Setting `exclude` to `*/tests/*` results in only copying files that don\'t lie inside a folder named `tests` (both directly and indirectly). Here, a file with for example the path `foo/tests/bar/baz.txt` would not be copied over.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Copy wiki files to external repo\n\nThis workflow configuration will copy all files from the repository\'s wiki to a folder named `wiki` in the destination repo `andstor.github.io`.\n\nThis can for example be used to merge several wikies of an organisation, and display them on a custom GitHub Pages site.

615,"b'# Execute Gradle builds in GitHub Actions workflows\n\nThis GitHub Action can be used to configure Gradle and optionally execute a Gradle build on any platform supported by GitHub Actions.\n\n## Why use the `gradle-build-action`?\n\nIt is possible to directly invoke Gradle in your workflow, and the `actions/setup-java@v3` action provides a simple way to cache Gradle dependencies. \n\nHowever, the `gradle-build-action` offers a number of advantages over this approach:\n\n- Easily [configure your workflow to use a specific version of Gradle](#use-a-specific-gradle-version) using the `gradle-version` parameter. Gradle distributions are automatically downloaded and cached. \n- More sophisticated and more efficient caching of Gradle User Home between invocations, compared to `setup-java` and most custom configurations using `actions/cache`. [More details below](#caching).\n- Detailed reporting of cache usage and cache configuration options allow you to [optimize the use of the GitHub actions cache](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).\n- [Generate and Submit a GitHub Dependency Graph](#github-dependency-graph-support) for your project, enabling Dependabot security alerts.\n- [Automatic capture of Build Scan\xc2\xae links](#build-scans) from the build, making these easier to locate for workflow run.\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` is designed to provide these benefits with minimal configuration. \nThese features work both when Gradle is executed via the `gradle-build-action` and for any Gradle execution in subsequent steps.\n\n## Use the action to setup Gradle\n\nThe recommended way to use the `gradle-build-action` is in an initial ""Setup Gradle"" step, with subsquent steps invoking Gradle directly with a `run` step. This makes the action minimally invasive, and allows a workflow to configure and execute a Gradle execution in any way.\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` works by configuring environment variables and by adding a set of Gradle init-scripts to the Gradle User Home. These will apply to all Gradle executions on the runner, no matter how Gradle is invoked. \nThis means that if you have an existing workflow that executes Gradle with a `run` step, you can add an initial ""Setup Gradle"" Step to benefit from caching, build-scan capture and other features of the gradle-build-action.\n\n\n```yaml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n        \n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    \n    - name: Execute Gradle build\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\n## Choose a specific Gradle version\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` can download and install a specified Gradle version, adding this installed version to the PATH.\nDownloaded Gradle versions are stored in the GitHub Actions cache, to avoid requiring downloading again later.\n\n```yaml\n - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n   with:\n     gradle-version: 6.5\n```\n\nThe `gradle-version` parameter can be set to any valid Gradle version.\n\nMoreover, you can use the following aliases:\n\n| Alias | Selects |\n| --- |---|\n| `wrapper`           | The Gradle wrapper\'s version (default, useful for matrix builds) |\n| `current`           | The current [stable release](https://gradle.org/install/) |\n| `release-candidate` | The current [release candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate/) if any, otherwise fallback to `current` |\n| `nightly`           | The latest [nightly](https://gradle.org/nightly/), fails if none. |\n| `release-nightly`   | The latest [release nightly](https://gradle.org/release-nightly/), fails if none.      |\n\nThis can be handy to automatically verify your build works with the latest release candidate of Gradle:\n\nThe actual Gradle version used is available as an action output: `gradle-version`.\n\n```yaml\nname: Test latest Gradle RC\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: 0 0 * * * # daily\njobs:\n  gradle-rc:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n    - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      id: setup-gradle\n      with:\n        gradle-version: release-candidate\n    - run: gradle build --dry-run # just test build configuration\n    - run: echo ""The release-candidate version was ${{ steps.setup-gradle.outputs.gradle-version }}""\n```\n\n\n## Caching build state between Jobs\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` will use the GitHub Actions cache to save and restore reusable state that may be speed up a subsequent build invocation. This includes most content that is downloaded from the internet as part of a build, as well as expensive to create content like compiled build scripts, transformed Jar files, etc.\n\nThe state that is cached includes:\n- Any distributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter ;\n- A subset of the Gradle User Home directory, including downloaded dependencies, wrapper distributions, and the local build cache ;\n\nTo reduce the space required for caching, this action makes a best effort to reduce duplication in cache entries.\n\nState will be restored from the cache during the first `gradle-build-action` step for any workflow job, and cache entries will be written back to the cache at the end of the job, after all Gradle executions have completed.\n\n### Disabling caching\n\nCaching is enabled by default. You can disable caching for the action as follows:\n```yaml\ncache-disabled: true\n```\n\n### Using the cache read-only\n\nBy default, the `gradle-build-action` will only write to the cache from Jobs on the default (`main`/`master`) branch.\nJobs on other branches will read entries from the cache but will not write updated entries. \nSee [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness) for a more detailed explanation.\n\nIn some circumstances it makes sense to change this default, and to configure a workflow Job to read existing cache entries but not to write changes back.\n\nYou can configure read-only caching for the `gradle-build-action` as follows:\n\n```yaml\ncache-read-only: true\n```\n\nYou can also configure read-only caching only for certain branches:\n\n```yaml\n# Only write to the cache for builds on the \'main\' and \'release\' branches. (Default is \'main\' only.)\n# Builds on other branches will only read existing entries from the cache.\ncache-read-only: ${{ github.ref != \'refs/heads/main\' && github.ref != \'refs/heads/release\' }}\n```\n\n### Using the cache write-only\n\nIn certain circumstances it may be desirable to start with a clean Gradle User Home state, but to save that state at the end of a workflow Job:\n\n```yaml\ncache-write-only: true\n```\n\n### Overwriting an existing Gradle User Home\n\nWhen the action detects that the Gradle User Home caches directory already exists (`~/.gradle/caches`), then by default it will not overwrite the existing content of this directory.\nThis can occur when a prior action initializes this directory, or when using a self-hosted runner that retains this directory between uses.\n\nIn this case the Job Summary will display a message like: \n> Caching for gradle-build-action was disabled due to pre-existing Gradle User Home\n\nIf you want override the default and have the `gradle-build-action` caches overwrite existing content in the Gradle User Home, you can set the `cache-overwrite-existing` parameter to \'true\':\n\n```yaml\ncache-overwrite-existing: true\n```\n\n### Incompatibility with other caching mechanisms\n\nWhen using `gradle-build-action` we recommend that you avoid using other mechanisms to save and restore the Gradle User Home. \n\nSpecifically:\n- Avoid using `actions/cache` configured to cache the Gradle User Home, [as described in this example](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/examples.md#java---gradle).\n- Avoid using `actions/setup-java` with the `cache: gradle` option, [as described here](https://github.com/actions/setup-java#caching-gradle-dependencies).\n\nUsing either of these mechanisms may interfere with the caching provided by this action. If you choose to use a different mechanism to save and restore the Gradle User Home, you should disable the caching provided by this action, as described above.\n\n### Cache debugging and analysis\n\nA report of all cache entries restored and saved is printed to the Job Summary when saving the cache entries. \nThis report can provide valuable insignt into how much cache space is being used.\n\nIt is possible to enable additional debug logging for cache operations. You do via the `GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable:\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED: true\n```\n\nNote that this setting will also prevent certain cache operations from running in parallel, further assisting with debugging.\n\n## How Gradle User Home caching works\n\n### Properties of the GitHub Actions cache\n\nThe GitHub Actions cache has some properties that present problems for efficient caching of the Gradle User Home.\n- Immutable entries: once a cache entry is written for a key, it cannot be overwritten or changed.\n- Branch scope: cache entries written for a Git branch are not visible from actions running against different branches. Entries written for the default branch are visible to all. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache\n- Restore keys: if no exact match is found, a set of partial keys can be provided that will match by cache key prefix. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key\n\nEach of these properties has influenced the design and implementation of the caching in `gradle-build-action`, as described below.\n\n### Which content is cached\n\nUsing experiments and observations, we have attempted to identify which Gradle User Home content is worth saving and restoring between build invocations. We considered both the respective size of the content and the impact this content has on build times. As well as the obvious candidates like downloaded dependencies, we saw that compiled build scripts, transformed Jar files and other content can also have a significant impact.\n\nIn the end, we opted to save and restore as much content as is practical, including:\n- `caches/<version>/generated-gradle-jars`: These files are generated on first use of a particular Gradle version, and are expensive to recreate\n- `caches/<version>/kotlin-dsl` and `caches/<version>/scripts`: These are the compiled build scripts. The Kotlin ones in particular can benefit from caching.\n- `caches/modules-2`: The downloaded dependencies\n- `caches/transforms-3`: The results of artifact transforms\n- `caches/jars-9`: Jar files that have been processed/instrumented by Gradle\n- `caches/build-cache-1`: The local build cache\n\nIn certain cases a particular section of Gradle User Home will be too large to make caching effective. In these cases, particular subdirectories can be excluded from caching. See [Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache](#exclude-content-from-gradle-user-home-cache).\n\n### Cache keys\n\nThe actual content of the Gradle User Home after a build is the result of many factors, including:\n- Core Gradle build files (`settngs.gradle[.kts]`, `build.gradle[.kts]`, `gradle.properties`)\n- Associated Gradle configuration files (`gradle-wrapper.properties`, `dependencies.toml`, etc)\n- The entire content of `buildSrc` or any included builds that provide plugins.\n- The entire content of the repository, in the case of the local build cache.\n- The actual build command that was invoked, including system properties and environment variables.\n\nFor this reason, it\'s very difficult to create a cache key that will deterministically map to a saved Gradle User Home state. So instead of trying to reliably hash all of these inputs to generate a cache key, the Gradle User Home cache key is based on the currently executing Job and the current commit hash for the repository.\n\nThe Gradle User Home cache key is composed of:\n- The current operating system (`RUNNER_OS`)\n- The workflow name and Job ID\n- A hash of the Job matrix parameters\n- The git SHA for the latest commit\n\nSpecifically, the cache key is: `${cache-protocol}-gradle|${runner-os}|${workflow-name}-${job-id}[${hash-of-job-matrix}]-${git-sha}`\n\nAs such, the cache key is likely to change on each subsequent run of GitHub actions. \nThis allows the most recent state to always be available in the GitHub actions cache.\n\n### Finding a matching cache entry\n\nIn most cases, no exact match will exist for the cache key. Instead, the Gradle User Home will be restored for the closest matching cache entry, using a set of ""restore keys"". The entries will be matched with the following precedence:\n- An exact match on OS, workflow, job, matrix and Git SHA\n- The most recent entry saved for the same OS, workflow, job and matrix values\n- The most recent entry saved for the same OS, workflow and job\n- The most recent entry saved for the same OS\n\nDue to branch scoping of cache entries, the above match will be first performed for entries from the same branch, and then for the default (\'main\') branch.\n\nAfter the Job is complete, the current Gradle User Home state will be collected and written as a new cache entry with the complete cache key. Old entries will be expunged from the GitHub Actions cache on a least-recently-used basis.\n\nNote that while effective, this mechanism is not inherently efficient. It requires the entire Gradle User Home directory to be stored separately for each branch, for every OS+Job+Matrix combination. In addition, a new cache entry to be written on every GitHub Actions run. \n\nThis inefficiency is effectively mitigated by [Deduplication of Gradle User Home cache entries](#deduplication-of-gradle-user-home-cache-entries), and can be further optimized for a workflow using the techniques described in [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).\n\n### Deduplication of Gradle User Home cache entries\n\nTo reduce duplication between cache entries, certain artifacts in Gradle User Home are extracted and cached independently based on their identity. This allows each Gradle User Home cache entry to be relatively small, sharing common elements between them without duplication.\n\nArtifacts that are cached independently include:\n- Downloaded dependencies\n- Downloaded wrapper distributions\n- Generated Gradle API jars\n- Downloaded Java Toolchains\n\nFor example, this means that all jobs executing a particular version of the Gradle wrapper will share a single common entry for this wrapper distribution and one for each of the generated Gradle API jars.\n\n### Stopping the Gradle daemon\n\nBy default, the action will stop all running Gradle daemons in the post-action step, prior to saving the Gradle User Home state. \nThis allows for any Gradle User Home cleanup to occur, and avoid file-locking issues on Windows.\n\nIf caching is disabled or the cache is in read-only mode, the daemon will not be stopped and will continue running after the job is completed.\n\n## Optimizing cache effectiveness\n\nCache storage space for GitHub actions is limited, and writing new cache entries can trigger the deletion of existing entries.\nEviction of shared cache entries can reduce cache effectiveness, slowing down your `gradle-build-action` steps.\n\nThere are a number of actions you can take if your cache use is less effective due to entry eviction.\n\nAt the end of a Job, the `gradle-build-action` will write a summary of the Gradle builds executed, together with a detailed report of the cache entries that were read and written during the Job. This report can provide valuable insights that may help to determine the right way to optimize the cache usage for your workflow.\n\n### Select which jobs should write to the cache\n\nConsider a workflow that first runs a Job ""compile-and-unit-test"" to compile the code and run some basic unit tests, which is followed by a matrix of parallel ""integration-test"" jobs that each run a set of integration tests for the repository. Each ""integration test"" Job requires all of the dependencies required by ""compile-and-unit-test"", and possibly one or 2 additional dependencies.\n\nBy default, a new cache entry will be written on completion of each integration test job. If no additional dependencies were downloaded then this cache entry will share the ""dependencies"" entry with the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job, but if a single dependency was downloaded then an entire new ""dependencies"" entry would be written. (The `gradle-build-action` does not _yet_ support a layered cache that could do this more efficiently). If each of these ""integration-test"" entries with their different ""dependencies"" entries is too large, then it could result in other important entries being evicted from the GitHub Actions cache.\n\nThere are some techniques that can be used to avoid/mitigate this issue:\n- Configure the ""integration-test"" jobs with `cache-read-only: true`, meaning that the Job will use the entry written by the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job. This will avoid the overhead of cache entries for each of these jobs, at the expense of re-downloading any additional dependencies required by ""integration-test"".\n- Add an additional step to the ""compile-and-unit-test"" job which downloads all dependencies required by the integration-test jobs but does not execute the tests. This will allow the ""dependencies"" entry for ""compile-and-unit-test"" to be shared among all cache entries for ""integration-test"". The resulting ""integration-test"" entries should be much smaller, reducing the potential for eviction.\n- Combine the above 2 techniques, so that no cache entry is written by ""integration-test"" jobs, but all required dependencies are already present from the restored ""compile-and-unit-test"" entry.\n\n### Select which branches should write to the cache\n\nGitHub cache entries are not shared between builds on different branches. \nThis means that each PR branch will have it\'s own Gradle User Home cache, and will not benefit from cache entries written by other PR branches.\nAn exception to this is that cache entries written in parent and upstream branches are visible to child branches, and cache entries for the default (`master`/`main`) branch can be read by actions invoked for any other branch.\n\nBy default, the `gradle-build-action` will only _write_ to the cache for builds run on the default (`master`/`main`) branch. \nJobs run on other branches will only read from the cache. In most cases, this is the desired behaviour, \nbecause Jobs run against other branches will benefit from the cache Gradle User Home from `main`, \nwithout writing private cache entries that could lead to evicting shared entries.\n\nIf you have other long-lived development branches that would benefit from writing to the cache, \nyou can configure these by overriding the `cache-read-only` action parameter. \nSee [Using the caches read-only](#using-the-caches-read-only) for more details.\n\nSimilarly, you could use `cache-read-only` for certain jobs in the workflow, and instead have these jobs reuse the cache content from upstream jobs.\n\n### Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache\n\nAs well as any wrapper distributions, the action will attempt to save and restore the `caches` and `notifications` directories from Gradle User Home.\n\nEach build is different, and some builds produce more Gradle User Home content than others.\n[Cache debugging ](#cache-debugging-and-analysis) can provide insight into which cache entries are the largest,\nand the contents to be cached can be fine tuned by including and excluding certain paths within Gradle User Home.\n\n```yaml\n# Cache downloaded JDKs in addition to the default directories.\ngradle-home-cache-includes: |\n    caches\n    notifications\n    jdks\n# Exclude the local build-cache and keyrings from the directories cached.\ngradle-home-cache-excludes: |\n    caches/build-cache-1\n    caches/keyrings\n```\n\nYou can specify any number of fixed paths or patterns to include or exclude. \nFile pattern support is documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#patterns-to-match-file-paths.\n\n### Remove unused files from Gradle User Home before saving to cache\n\nThe Gradle User Home directory has a tendency to grow over time. When you switch to a new Gradle wrapper version or upgrade a dependency version\nthe old files are not automatically and immediately removed. While this can make sense in a local environment, in a GitHub Actions environment\nit can lead to ever-larger Gradle User Home cache entries being saved and restored.\n\nIn order to avoid this situation, the `gradle-build-action` supports the `gradle-home-cache-cleanup` parameter. \nWhen enabled, this feature will attempt to delete any files in the Gradle User Home that were not used by Gradle during the GitHub Actions workflow, \nprior to saving the Gradle User Home to the GitHub Actions cache.\n\nGradle Home cache cleanup is considered experimental and is disabled by default.  You can enable this feature for the action as follows:\n```yaml\ngradle-home-cache-cleanup: true\n```\n\n## Build reporting\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` collects information about any Gradle executions that occur in a workflow, and reports these via\na Job Summary, visible in the GitHub Actions UI. For each Gradle execution, details about the invocation are listed, together with\na link to any Build Scan\xc2\xae published.\n\nGeneration of a Job Summary is enabled by default. If this is not desired, it can be disable as follows:\n```yaml\ngenerate-job-summary: false\n```\n\nNote that the action collects information about Gradle invocations via an [Initialization Script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html#sec:using_an_init_script)\nlocated at `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/build-result-capture.init.gradle`.\nIf you are using init scripts for the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise) like\n[`scans-init.gradle` or `gradle-enterprise-init.gradle`](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#scans_gradle_com),\nyou\'ll need to ensure these files are applied prior to `build-result-capture.init.gradle`.\nSince Gradle applies init scripts in alphabetical order, one way to ensure this is via file naming.\n\n### Build Scan\xc2\xae link as Step output\n\nAs well as reporting the [Build Scan](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) link in the Job Summary,\nthe `gradle-build-action` action makes this link available as a Step output named `build-scan-url`.\n\nYou can then use that link in subsequent actions of your workflow. For example:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/gradle-build-pr.yml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout project sources\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    - name: Run build with Gradle wrapper\n      id: gradle\n      run: ./gradlew build --scan\n    - name: ""Add Build Scan URL as PR comment""\n      uses: actions/github-script@v5\n      if: github.event_name == \'pull_request\' && failure()\n      with:\n        github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n        script: |\n          github.rest.issues.createComment({\n            issue_number: context.issue.number,\n            owner: context.repo.owner,\n            repo: context.repo.repo,\n            body: \'\xe2\x9d\x8c ${{ github.workflow }} failed: ${{ steps.gradle.outputs.build-scan-url }}\'\n          })\n```\n\n### Saving build outputs\n\nBy default, a GitHub Actions workflow using `gradle-build-action` will record the log output and any Build Scan links for your build,\nbut any output files generated by the build will not be saved.\n\nTo save selected files from your build execution, you can use the core [Upload-Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\njobs:   \n  gradle:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout project sources\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    - name: Run build with Gradle wrapper\n      run: ./gradlew build --scan\n    - name: Upload build reports\n      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: build-reports\n        path: build/reports/\n```\n\n## Use the action to invoke Gradle\n\nIf the `gradle-build-action` is configured with an `arguments` input, then Gradle will execute a Gradle build with the arguments provided. NOTE: We recommend using the `gradle-build-action` as a ""Setup Gradle"" step as described above, with Gradle being invoked via a regular `run` command.\n\nIf no `arguments` are provided, the action will not execute Gradle, but will still cache Gradle state and configure build-scan capture for all subsequent Gradle executions.\n\n```yaml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n    \n    - name: Setup and execute Gradle \'test\' task\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        arguments: test\n```\n\n### Multiple Gradle executions in the same Job\n\nIt is possible to configure multiple Gradle executions to run sequentially in the same job. \nThe initial Action step will perform the Gradle setup.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: assemble\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: check\n```\n\n### Gradle command-line arguments\n\nThe `arguments` input can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to the `gradle` command line.\nArguments can be supplied in a single line, or as a multi-line input.\n\nHere are some valid examples:\n```yaml\narguments: build\narguments: check --scan\narguments: some arbitrary tasks\narguments: build -PgradleProperty=foo\narguments: |\n    build\n    --scan\n    -PgradleProperty=foo\n    -DsystemProperty=bar\n```\n\nIf you need to pass environment variables, use the GitHub Actions workflow syntax:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  env:\n    CI: true\n  with:\n    arguments: build\n```\n\n### Gradle build located in a subdirectory\n\nBy default, the action will execute Gradle in the root directory of your project. \nUse the `build-root-directory` input to target a Gradle build in a subdirectory.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: build\n    build-root-directory: some/subdirectory\n```\n\n### Using a specific Gradle executable\n\nThe action will first look for a Gradle wrapper script in the root directory of your project. \nIf not found, `gradle` will be executed from the PATH.\nUse the `gradle-executable` input to execute using a specific Gradle installation.\n\n```yaml\n - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n   with:\n     arguments: build\n     gradle-executable: /path/to/installed/gradle\n```\n\nThis mechanism can also be used to target a Gradle wrapper script that is located in a non-default location.\n\n## Support for GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)\n\nYou can use the `gradle-build-action` on GitHub Enterprise Server, and benefit from the improved integration with Gradle. Depending on the version of GHES you are running, certain features may be limited:\n- Build Scan links are captured and displayed in the GitHub Actions UI\n- Easily run your build with different versions of Gradle\n- Save/restore of Gradle User Home (requires GHES v3.5+ : GitHub Actions cache was introduced in GHES 3.5)\n- Support for GitHub Actions Job Summary (requires GHES 3.6+ : GitHub Actions Job Summary support was introduced in GHES 3.6). In earlier versions of GHES the build-results summary and caching report will be written to the workflow log, as part of the post-action step.\n\n# GitHub Dependency Graph support\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` has support for submitting a [GitHub Dependency Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph) snapshot via the [GitHub Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission?apiVersion=2022-11-28).\n\nThe dependency graph snapshot is generated via integration with the [GitHub Dependency Graph Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin), and saved as a workflow artifact. The generated snapshot files can be submitted either in the same job, or in a subsequent job (in the same or a dependent workflow).\n\nThe generated dependency graph snapshot reports all of the dependencies that were resolved during a bulid execution, and is used by GitHub to generate [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) for vulnerable dependencies, as well as to populate the [Dependency Graph insights view](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph).\n\n## Enable Dependency Graph generation for a workflow\n \nYou enable GitHub Dependency Graph support by setting the `dependency-graph` action parameter. Valid values are:\n\n| Option | Behaviour |\n| --- | --- |\n| `disabled`            | Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations.<p>This is the default. |\n| `generate`            | Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact. |\n| `generate-and-submit` | As per `generate`, but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job. |\n| `download-and-submit` | Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step. |\n\nDependency Graph _submission_ (but not generation) requires the `contents: write` permission, which may need to be explicitly enabled in the workflow file.\n\nExample of a simple workflow that generates and submits a dependency graph:\n```yaml\nname: Submit dependency graph\non:\n  push:\n  \npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph snapshot which will be submitted\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\nThe `contents: write` permission is not required to generate the dependency graph, but is required in order to submit the graph via the GitHub API.\n\nThe above configuration will work for workflows that run as a result of commits to a repository branch, but not when a workflow is triggered by a PR from a repository fork.\nFor a configuration that supports this setup, see [Dependency Graphs for pull request workflows](#dependency-graphs-for-pull-request-workflows).\n\n## Limiting the scope of the dependency graph\n\nAt times it is helpful to limit the dependencies reported to GitHub, in order to security alerts for dependencies that don\'t form a critical part of your product.\nFor example, a vulnerability in the tool you use to generate documentation is unlikely to be as important as a vulnerability in one of your runtime dependencies.\n\nThere are a number of techniques you can employ to limit the scope of the generated dependency graph:\n- [Don\'t generate a dependency graph for all Gradle executions](#choosing-which-gradle-invocations-will-generate-a-dependency-graph)\n- [For a Gradle execution, filter which Gradle projects and configurations will contribute dependencies](#filtering-which-gradle-configurations-contribute-to-the-dependency-graph)\n- [Use a separate workflow that only resolves the required dependencies]()\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Ideally, all dependencies involved in building and testing a project will be extracted and reported in a dependency graph. \n> These dependencies would be assigned to different scopes (eg development, runtime, testing) and the GitHub UI would make it easy to opt-in to security alerts for different dependency scopes.\n> However, this functionality does not yet exist.\n\n### Choosing which Gradle invocations will generate a dependency graph\n\nOnce you enable the dependency graph support for a workflow job (via the `dependency-graph` parameter), dependencies will be collected and reported for all subsequent Gradle invocations.\nIf you have a Gradle build step that you want to exclude from dependency graph generation, you can set the `GITHUB_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Build the app, generating a graph of dependencies required\n      run: ./gradlew :my-app:assemble\n    - name: Run all checks, disabling dependency graph generation\n      run: ./gradlew check\n      env:\n        GITHUB_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_ENABLED: false\n```\n\n### Filtering which Gradle Configurations contribute to the dependency graph\n\nIf you do not want the dependency graph to include every dependency configuration in every project in your build, you can limit the\ndependency extraction to a subset of these.\n\nTo restrict which Gradle subprojects contribute to the report, specify which projects to include via a regular expression.\nYou can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_PROJECTS` environment variable or system property.\n\nTo restrict which Gradle configurations contribute to the report, you can filter configurations by name using a regular expression.\nYou can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS` environment variable or system property.\n\nFor example, if you want to exclude dependencies in the `buildSrc` project, and only report on dependencies from the `runtimeClasspath` configuration,\nyou would use the following configuration:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph from \'runtimeClasspath\' configurations\n      run: ./gradlew build\n      env:\n        DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_PROJECTS: ""^:(?!buildSrc).*""\n        DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS: runtimeClasspath\n```\n\n### Use a dedicated workflow for dependency graph generation\n\nInstead of generating a dependency graph from your existing CI workflow, it\'s possible to create a separate dedicated workflow (or Job) that is solely intended for generating a dependency graph.\nSuch a workflow will still need to execute Gradle, but can do so in a way that is targeted at resolving exactly the dependencies required.\n\nFor example, the following workflow will report only those dependencies that are part of the `runtimeClasspath` or the `my-app` project. \n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Extract the \'runtimeClasspath\' dependencies for \'my-app\'\n      run: ./gradlew :my-app:dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath\n```\n\nNote that the above example will also include `buildSrc` dependencies, since these are resolved as part of running the `dependencies` task.\nIf this isn\'t desirable, you will still need to use the filtering mechanism described above.\n\n## Dependency Graphs for pull request workflows\n\nThis `contents: write` permission is not available for any workflow that is triggered by a pull request submitted from a forked repository, since it would permit a malicious pull request to make repository changes. \n\nBecause of this restriction, it is not possible to `generate-and-submit` a dependency graph generated for a pull-request that comes from a repository fork. In order to do so, 2 workflows will be required:\n1. The first workflow runs directly against the pull request sources and will generate the dependency graph snapshot.\n2. The second workflow is triggered on `workflow_run` of the first workflow, and will submit the previously saved dependency snapshots.\n\nNote: when `download-and-submit` is used in a workflow triggered via [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run), the action will download snapshots saved in the triggering workflow.\n\n***Main workflow file***\n```yaml\nname: run-build-and-generate-dependency-snapshot\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate # Only generate in this job\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph snapshot which will be submitted\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\n***Dependent workflow file***\n```yaml\nname: submit-dependency-snapshot\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'run-build-and-generate-dependency-snapshot\']\n    types: [completed]\n\njobs:\n  submit-snapshots:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Retrieve dependency graph artifact and submit\n        uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: download-and-submit\n```\n\n## Gradle version compatibility\n\nThe GitHub Dependency Graph plugin should be compatible with all versions of Gradle >= 5.0, and has been tested against \nGradle versions ""5.6.4"", ""6.9.4"", ""7.0.2"", ""7.6.2"", ""8.0.2"" and the current Gradle release.\n\nThe plugin is compatible with running Gradle with the configuration-cache enabled. However, this support is\nlimited to Gradle ""8.1.0"" and later:\n- With Gradle ""8.0"", the build should run successfully, but an empty dependency graph will be generated.\n- With Gradle <= ""7.6.4"", the plugin will cause the build to fail with configuration-cache enabled.\n\nTo use this plugin with versions of Gradle older than ""8.1.0"", you\'ll need to invoke Gradle with the\nconfiguration-cache disabled.\n\n# Gradle Enterprise plugin injection\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` provides support for injecting and configuring the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin into any Gradle build, without any modification to the project sources.\nThis is achieved via an init-script installed into Gradle User Home, which is enabled and parameterized via environment variables.\n\nThe same auto-injection behavior is available for the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin, which enriches any build scans published with additional useful information.\n\n## Enabling Gradle Enterprise injection\n\nIn order to enable Gradle Enterprise for your build, you must provide the required configuration via environment variables. \n\nHere\'s a minimal example:\n\n```yaml\nname: Run build with Gradle Enterprise injection\n  \nenv:\n  GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION_ENABLED: true\n  GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL: https://ge.gradle.org\n  GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION: 3.14.1\n  GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.GE_ACCESS_KEY }} # Required to publish scans to ge.gradle.org\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    - name: Run a Gradle build with Gradle Enterprise injection enabled\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\nThis configuration will automatically apply `v3.14.1` of the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/), and publish build scans to https://ge.gradle.org.\n\nNote that the `ge.gradle.org` server requires authentication in order to publish scans. The provided `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY` isn\'t required by the Gradle Enterprise injection script, \nbut will be used by the GE plugin in order to authenticate with the server.\n\n## Configuring Gradle Enterprise injection\n\nThe `init-script` supports a number of additional configuration parameters that you may fine useful. All configuration options (required and optional) are detailed below:\n\n| Variable | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION_ENABLED | :white_check_mark: | enables Gradle Enterprise injection |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL | :white_check_mark: | the URL of the Gradle Enterprise server |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SERVER | | allow communication with an untrusted server; set to _true_ if your Gradle Enterprise instance is using a self-signed certificate |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ENFORCE_URL | | enforce the configured Gradle Enterprise URL over a URL configured in the project\'s build; set to _true_ to enforce publication of build scans to the configured Gradle Enterprise URL |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION | :white_check_mark: | the version of the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) to apply |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION |  | the version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to apply, if any |\n| GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY_URL |  | the URL of the repository to use when resolving the GE and CCUD plugins; the Gradle Plugin Portal is used by default |\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

618,"b'# GitHub App Token\n\nThis [JavaScript GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#javascript-actions) can be used to impersonate a GitHub App when `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`\'s limitations are too restrictive and a personal access token is not suitable.\n\nFor instance, from [GitHub Actions\' docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow):\n\n> When you use the repository\'s `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, with the exception of `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch`, will not create a new workflow run.\n> This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.\n> For example, if a workflow run pushes code using the repository\'s `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when push events occur.\n\nA workaround is to use a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) from a [personal user/bot account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts).\nHowever, for organizations, GitHub Apps are [a more appropriate automation solution](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/#machine-vs-bot-accounts).\n\n# Example Workflow\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Generate token\n        id: generate_token\n        uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v1\n        with:\n          app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}\n\n          # Optional.\n          # github_api_url: https://api.example.com\n\n          # Optional.\n          # installation_id: 1337\n\n          # Optional.\n          # Using a YAML multiline string to avoid escaping the JSON quotes.\n          # permissions: >-\n          #   {""members"": ""read""}\n\n          private_key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}\n\n          # Optional.\n          # repository: owner/repo\n\n      - name: Use token\n        env:\n          TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate_token.outputs.token }}\n        run: |\n          echo ""The generated token is masked: ${TOKEN}""\n```\n\n[Another use case for this action can (or could) be found in GitHub\'s own docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20230115194214/https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/automating-projects-using-actions#example-workflow-authenticating-with-a-github-app).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

A few detailed \nexamples are also included below. Note that examples always reference the master branch,\nhowever you should change them to reference a [release](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/releases).\n\n### Example with Checkout\n\nFor most use cases, you will want to use the git repository that is being checked\nfor a GitHub actions, and we do this by way of the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.\n\n```\nname: Check URLs\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: urls-checker\n      uses: urlstechie/urlchecker-action@master\n      with:\n        # A subfolder or path to navigate to in the present or cloned repository\n        subfolder: docs\n\n        # A comma-separated list of file types to cover in the URL checks\n        file_types: .md,.py,.rst\n\n        # Choose whether to include file with no URLs in the prints.\n        print_all: false\n\n        # The timeout seconds to provide to requests, defaults to 5 seconds\n        timeout: 5\n\n        # How many times to retry a failed request (each is logged, defaults to 1)\n        retry_count: 3\n\n        # A comma separated links to exclude during URL checks\n        exclude_urls: https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/1,https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/2\n\n        # A comma separated patterns to exclude during URL checks\n        exclude_patterns: https://github.com/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues\n\n        # choose if the force pass or not\n        force_pass : true\n```\n\nNote that as of version 0.2.2, references to `white_listed_*` have been changed to\n`exclude_*` to be consistent with the `include_*` variables.\n\n\n### Example with Custom Clone\n\nIt could, however, be the case that you\'ve set up a repository with one or more uses of the URLChecker\nthat must clone one or more repos (possibly with varying branches) before doing the check.\nIn this case, you might want to define `git_path` and `branch` for each section.\nAn example is below:\n\n```\nname: Check URLs\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: URLs-checker\n      uses: urlstechie/urlchecker-action@master\n      with:\n        # A project to clone.

621,"b'# Skip Duplicate Actions\n\n`skip-duplicate-actions` provides the following features to optimize GitHub Actions:\n\n- [Skip duplicate workflow runs](#skip-duplicate-workflow-runs) after merges, pull requests or similar.\n- [Skip concurrent or parallel workflow runs](#skip-concurrent-workflow-runs) for things that you do not want to run twice.\n- [Skip ignored paths](#skip-ignored-paths) to speedup documentation-changes or similar.\n- [Skip if paths not changed](#skip-if-paths-not-changed) for something like directory-specific tests.\n- [Cancel outdated workflow runs](#cancel-outdated-workflow-runs) after branch-pushes.\n\nAll of those features help to save time and costs; especially for long-running workflows.\nYou can choose any subset of those features.\n\n## Skip duplicate workflow runs\n\nIf you work with feature branches, then you might see lots of _duplicate workflow runs_.\nFor example, duplicate workflow runs can happen if a workflow run is performed on a feature branch, but then the workflow run is repeated right after merging the feature branch.\n`skip-duplicate-actions` allows to prevent such runs.\n\n- **Full traceability:** After clean merges, you will see a message like `Skip execution because the exact same files have been successfully checked in <previous_run_URL>`.\n- **Fully configurable:** By default, manual triggers and cron will never be skipped.\n- **Flexible Git usage:** `skip-duplicate-actions` does not care whether you use fast-forward-merges, rebase-merges or squash-merges.\n  However, if a merge yields a result that is different from the source branch, then the resulting workflow run will _not_ be skipped.\n  This is commonly the case if you merge ""outdated branches"".\n\n## Skip concurrent workflow runs\n\nSometimes, there are workflows that you do not want to run twice at the same time even if they are triggered twice.\nTherefore, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides the following options to skip a workflow run if the same workflow is already running:\n\n- **Always skip:** This is useful if you have a workflow that you never want to run twice at the same time.\n- **Only skip same content:** For example, this can be useful if a workflow has both a `push` and a `pull_request` trigger, or if you push a tag right after pushing a commit.\n  (_Deprecated_, use `same_content_newer` instead)\n- **Only skip newer runs with the same content:** If the same workflow is running on the exact same content, skip newer runs of it. `same_content_newer` ensures that at least one of those workflows will run, while `same_content` may skip all of them.\n- **Only skip outdated runs:** For example, this can be useful for skip-checks that are not at the beginning of a job.\n- **Never skip:** This disables the concurrent skipping functionality, but still lets you use all other options like duplicate skipping.\n\n## Skip ignored paths\n\nIn many projects, it is unnecessary to run all tests for documentation-only-changes.\nTherefore, GitHub provides a [paths-ignore](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore) feature out of the box.\nHowever, GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` has some limitations:\n\n- GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` fails to look at previous commits. This means that the outcome depends on how often you push changes.\n- Consequently, GitHub\'s `paths-ignore` does not work for [required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-required-status-checks).\n  If you path-ignore a required check, then pull requests will block forever without being mergeable.\n\nTo overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more flexible `paths_ignore`-feature with an efficient backtracking-algorithm.\nInstead of stupidly looking at the current commit, `paths_ignore` will look for successful checks in your commit-history.\n\nYou can use the [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) option if you need to define multiple `paths_ignore` patterns in a single workflow.\n\n## Skip if paths not changed\n\nIn some projects, there are tasks that should be only executed if specific sub-directories were changed.\nTherefore, GitHub provides a [paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) feature out of the box.\nHowever, GitHub\'s `paths` has some limitations:\n\n- GitHub\'s `paths` cannot skip individual steps in a workflow.\n- GitHub\'s `paths` does not work with required checks that you really want to pass successfully.\n\nTo overcome those limitations, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a more sophisticated `paths`-feature.\nInstead of blindly skipping checks, the backtracking-algorithm will only skip something if it can find a suitable check in your commit-history.\n\nYou can use the [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) option if you need to define multiple `paths` patterns in a single workflow.\n\n## Cancel outdated workflow runs\n\nTypically, workflows should only run for the most recent commit.\nTherefore, when you push changes to a branch, `skip-duplicate-actions` can be configured to cancel any previous workflow runs that run against outdated commits.\n\n- **Full traceability:** If a workflow run is cancelled, then you will see a message like `Cancelled <previous_run_URL>`.\n- **Guaranteed execution:** The cancellation-algorithm guarantees that a complete check-set will finish no matter what.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `paths_ignore`\n\nA JSON-array with ignored path patterns.\nSee [cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet) for path-pattern examples.\nSee [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) for details about supported path-patterns.\n\n**Example:** `\'[""**/README.md"", ""**/docs/**""]\'`\n\n**Default:** `\'[]\'`\n\n### `paths`\n\nA JSON-array with path patterns.\nIf this is non-empty, then `skip-duplicate-actions` will try to skip commits that did not change any of those paths.\nIt uses the same syntax as [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore).\n\n**Example:** `\'[""platform-specific/**""]\'`\n\n**Default:** `\'[]\'`\n\n### `paths_filter`\n\nA YAML-string with named [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nfrontend:\n  paths_ignore:\n    - \'frontend/docs/**\'\n  paths:\n    - \'frontend/**\'\nbackend:\n  paths:\n    - \'backend/**\'\n  ### Here you can optionally control/limit backtracking\n  # Boolean or number (default: true)\n  # \'false\' means disable backtracking completely\n  # \'5\' means to stop after having traced back 5 commits\n  backtracking: 5\n```\n\nUseful if you have multiple jobs in one workflow and want to skip them based on different [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns.\nSee the corresponding [`paths_result`](#paths_result) output and [example configuration](#example-3-skip-using-paths_filter).\n\n### `cancel_others`\n\nIf true, then workflow runs from outdated commits will be cancelled.\n\n**Default:** `\'false\'`\n\n### `skip_after_successful_duplicate`\n\nIf true, skip if an already finished duplicate run can be found.\n\n**Default:** `\'true\'`\n\n### `do_not_skip`\n\nA JSON-array with triggers that should never be skipped.\n\nPossible values are `pull_request`, `push`, `workflow_dispatch`, `schedule`, `release`.\n\n**Default:** `\'[""workflow_dispatch"", ""schedule""]\'`\n\n### `concurrent_skipping`\n\nSkip a workflow run if the same workflow is already running.\n\nOne of `never`, `same_content`, `same_content_newer`, `outdated_runs`, `always`.\n\n**Default:** `\'never\'`\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `should_skip`\n\nReturns `\'true\'` if the current run should be skipped according to your configured rules. This should be evaluated for either individual steps or entire jobs.\n\n### `reason`\n\nThe reason why the current run is considered skippable or unskippable. Corresponds approximately to the input options.\n\n**Example:** `skip_after_successful_duplicate`\n\n### `skipped_by`\n\nReturns information about the workflow run which caused the current run to be skipped.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n  ""id"": 1709469369,\n  ""runNumber"": 737,\n  ""event"": ""pull_request"",\n  ""treeHash"": ""e3434bb7aeb3047d7df948f09419ac96cf03d73e"",\n  ""commitHash"": ""4a0432e823468ecff81a978165cb35586544c795"",\n  ""status"": ""completed"",\n  ""conclusion"": ""success"",\n  ""htmlUrl"": ""https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions/actions/runs/1709469369"",\n  ""branch"": ""master"",\n  ""repo"": ""fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions"",\n  ""workflowId"": 2640563,\n  ""createdAt"": ""2022-01-17T18:56:06Z""\n}\n```\n\n- Returns information only when current run is considered skippable, otherwise an empty object (`{}`) is returned.\n\n### `paths_result`\n\nReturns information for each configured filter in `paths_filter`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  ""frontend"": {\n    ""should_skip"": true,\n    ""backtrack_count"": 1,\n    ""skipped_by"": {\n      // Information about the workflow run\n    },\n  ""backend"": {\n    ""should_skip"": false,\n    ""backtrack_count"": 1,\n    ""matched_files"": [""backend/file.txt""]\n  },\n  ""global"": {\n    ""should_skip"": false,\n    ""backtrack_count"": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- The `global` key corresponds to the ""global"" [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) and [`paths`](#paths) options.\n- A list of matched files is returned in `matched_files`, if there are any.\n- The `skipped_by` return value behaves the same as the ""global"" [`skipped_by`](#skipped_by) output.\n- The `backtrack_count` shows how many commits where traced back (skipped) until an appropriate commit has been found.\n- If `skip-duplicate-actions` terminates before the paths checks are performed (for example, when a successful duplicate run has been found) an empty object is returned (`{}`).\n\n### `changed_files`\n\nA two-dimensional array, with a list of changed files for each commit that has been traced back.\n\n**Example:** `[[""some/example/file.txt"", ""another/example/file.txt""], [""frontend/file.txt""]]`\n\n- Having a two-dimensional list makes processing flexible. For example, one can flatten (and uniquify) the list to get changed files from all commits which were traced back. Or one can use `changed_files[0]` to get changed files from the latest commit. One might also use the output of `backtrack_count` from [`paths_result`](#paths_result) to process the list of changed files.\n- Returns information only if one of the options [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore), [`paths`](#paths), [`paths_filter`](#paths_filter) is set.\n- If `skip-duplicate-actions` terminates before the paths checks are performed (for example, when a successful duplicate run has been found) an empty array (`[]`) is returned.\n\n## Usage examples\n\nYou can use `skip-duplicate-actions` to either skip individual steps or entire jobs.\nTo minimize changes to existing jobs, it is often easier to skip entire jobs.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> - You may need to use [`fromJSON`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson) to access properties of object outputs. For example, for `skipped_by.id`, you can use the expression: `${{ fromJSON(steps.skip_check.outputs.skipped_by).id }}`.\n> - For GitHub repositories where [default permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) for `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been set to ""permissive (read-only)"", the following lines must be included in the workflow (see [permissions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions)):\n>   ```yaml\n>   # Minimum permissions required by skip-duplicate-actions\n>   permissions:\n>     actions: write\n>     contents: read\n>   ```\n\n### Example 1: Skip entire jobs\n\nTo skip entire jobs, you should add a `pre_job` that acts as a pre-condition for your `main_job`.\nAlthough this example looks like a lot of code, there are only two additional lines in your project-specific `main_job` (the `needs`-clause and the `if`-clause):\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  pre_job:\n    # continue-on-error: true # Uncomment once integration is finished\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Map a step output to a job output\n    outputs:\n      should_skip: ${{ steps.skip_check.outputs.should_skip }}\n    steps:\n      - id: skip_check\n        uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@v5\n        with:\n          # All of these options are optional, so you can remove them if you are happy with the defaults\n          concurrent_skipping: \'never\'\n          skip_after_successful_duplicate: \'true\'\n          paths_ignore: \'[""**/README.md"", ""**/docs/**""]\'\n          do_not_skip: \'[""pull_request"", ""workflow_dispatch"", ""schedule""]\'\n\n  main_job:\n    needs: pre_job\n    if: needs.pre_job.outputs.should_skip != \'true\'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - run: echo ""Running slow tests..."" && sleep 30\n```\n\n### Example 2: Skip individual steps\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to skip an individual step with an `if`-clause and an `id`.\nIn this example, the step will be skipped if no files in `src/` or `dist/` were changed:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  skip_individual_steps_job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - id: skip_check\n        uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@v5\n        with:\n          cancel_others: \'false\'\n          paths: \'[""src/**"", ""dist/**""]\'\n      - if: steps.skip_check.outputs.should_skip != \'true\'\n        run: |\n          echo ""Run only if src/ or dist/ changed..."" && sleep 30\n          echo ""Do other stuff...""\n```\n\n### Example 3: Skip using `paths_filter`\n\nThe `paths_filter` option can be used if you have multiple jobs in a workflow and want to skip them based on different [`paths_ignore`](#paths_ignore) / [`paths`](#paths) patterns. When defining such filters, the action returns corresponding information in the [`paths_result`](#paths_result) output.\nFor example in a monorepo, you might want to run jobs related to the ""frontend"" only if some files in the corresponding ""frontend/"" folder have changed and the same for ""backend"". This can be achieved with the following configuration:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  pre_job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      should_skip: ${{ steps.skip_check.outputs.should_skip }}\n      paths_result: ${{ steps.skip_check.outputs.paths_result }}\n    steps:\n      - id: skip_check\n        uses: fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@v5\n        with:\n          paths_filter: |\n            frontend:\n              paths_ignore:\n                - \'frontend/docs/**\'\n              paths:\n                - \'frontend/**\'\n            backend:\n              paths:\n                - \'backend/**\'\n          # Can be mixed with the ""global"" \'paths_ignore\' / \'paths\' options, for example:\n          # paths_ignore: \'[""**/README.md""]\'\n\n  frontend:\n    needs: pre_job\n    # If \'skip-duplicate-actions\' terminates before the paths checks are performed (for example, when a successful duplicate run has\n    # been found) \'paths_result\' outputs an empty object (\'{}\'). This can be easily intercepted in the if condition of a job\n    #\xc2\xa0by checking the result of the ""global"" \'should_skip\' output first.\n    if: needs.pre_job.outputs.should_skip != \'true\' || !fromJSON(needs.pre_job.outputs.paths_result).frontend.should_skip\n    # ...\n\n  backend:\n    # ...\n```\n\n## How does it work?\n\n`skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Workflow Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs) to query workflow runs.\n`skip-duplicate-actions` will only look at workflow runs that belong to the same workflow as the current workflow run.\nAfter querying such workflow runs, it will compare them with the current workflow run as follows:\n\n- If there exists a workflow run with the same tree hash, then we have identified a duplicate workflow run.\n- If there exists an in-progress workflow run, then we can cancel it or skip, depending on your configuration.\n\n## How does path-skipping work?\n\nAs mentioned above, `skip-duplicate-actions` provides a path-skipping functionality that is somewhat similar to GitHub\'s native `paths` and `paths_ignore` functionality.\nHowever, path-skipping is not entirely trivial because there exist multiple options on how to do path-skipping:\n\n### Option 1: Only look at the ""current"" commit\n\nThis is the thing that GitHub is currently doing, and we consider it as insufficient because it does not work for ""required"" checks.\nAnother problem is that the outcomes can be heavily dependent on the pushing-sequence of commits.\n\n### Option 2: Look at Pull-Request-diffs\n\nPR-diffs are simple to understand, but they only work after opening a PR, not immediately after pushing a feature-branch.\n\n### Option 3: Look for successful checks of previous commits\n\nThis option is implemented by `skip-duplicate-actions`.\nAn advantage is that this works regardless of whether you are using PRs or raw feature-branches, and of course it also works for ""required"" checks.\nInternally, `skip-duplicate-actions` uses the [Repos Commit API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#get-a-commit) to perform an efficient backtracking-algorithm for paths-skipping-detection.\n\nThis is how the algorithm works approximately:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    Check_Commit: Check Commit\n    [*] --> Check_Commit: Current commit\n\n    state Path_Ignored <<choice>>\n    Check_Commit --> Path_Ignored: Do all changed files match against ""paths_ignore""?\n    Ignored_Yes: Yes\n    Ignored_No: No\n    Path_Ignored --> Ignored_Yes\n    Path_Ignored --> Ignored_No\n\n    state Path_Skipped <<choice>>\n    Ignored_No --> Path_Skipped: Do none of the changed files match against ""paths""?\n    Skipped_Yes: Yes\n    Skipped_No: No\n    Path_Skipped --> Skipped_Yes: No matches\n    Path_Skipped --> Skipped_No: Some matches\n\n    Parent_Commit: Fetch Parent Commit\n    Ignored_Yes --> Parent_Commit\n    Skipped_Yes --> Parent_Commit\n\n    state Successful_Run <<choice>>\n    Parent_Commit --> Successful_Run: Is there a successful run for this commit?\n    Run_Yes: Yes\n    Run_No: No\n    Successful_Run --> Run_Yes\n    Successful_Run --> Run_No\n\n    Run_No --> Check_Commit: Parent commit\n\n    Skip: Skip!\n    Run_Yes --> Skip: (Because all changes since this run are in ignored or skipped paths)\n\n    Dont_Skip: Don\'t Skip!\n    Skipped_No --> Dont_Skip: (Because changed files needs to be ""tested"")\n```\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How to Use Skip Check With Required Matrix Jobs?\n\nDiscussed in https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions/issues/44.\n\nIf you have matrix jobs that are registered as required status checks and the matrix runs conditionally based on the skip check, you might run into the problem that the pull request remains in a unmergable state forever because the jobs are not executed at all and thus not reported as skipped (`Expected - Waiting for status to be reported`).\n\nThere are several approaches to circumvent this problem:\n\n- Define the condition (`if`) in each step in the matrix job instead of a single condition on the job level: https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions/issues/44\n- If you want the check to be considered successful only if all jobs in the matrix were successful, you can add a subsequent job whose only task is to report the final status of the matrix. Then you can register this final job as a required status check:\n  ```yaml\n  result:\n    name: Result\n    if: needs.pre_job.outputs.should_skip != \'true\' && always()\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs:\n      - pre_job\n      - example-matrix-job\n    steps:\n      - name: Mark result as failed\n        if: needs.example-matrix-job.result != \'success\'\n        run: exit 1\n  ```\n- Define an opposite workflow, as offically suggested by GitHub: [Handling skipped but required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@paescuj](https://github.com/paescuj)\n- [@fkirc](https://github.com/fkirc)\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This will automatically backport the PR to the branch called ""production"" when the PR is merged. \n\n## Configuration\n\nFor more fine grained customization, and for the ability to run the [Backport Tool](https://github.com/sqren/backport) as a CLI tool locally, you should create a `.backportrc.json` file in the root directory:\n\n```js\n// .backportrc.json\n{\n  // example repo info\n  ""repoOwner"": ""torvalds"",\n  ""repoName"": ""linux"",\n\n  // `targetBranch` option allows to automatically backport every PR to a specific branch without the need for labels\n  ""targetBranches"": [""production""],\n\n  // the branches available to backport to\n  ""targetBranchChoices"": [""main"", ""production"", ""staging""],\n\n  // In this case, adding the label ""backport-to-production"" will backport the PR to the ""production"" branch\n  ""branchLabelMapping"": {\n    ""^backport-to-(.+)$"": ""$1""\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n See the [Backport Tool documentation](https://github.com/sqren/backport/blob/main/docs/config-file-options.md) for all configuration options.\n\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The process of hosting these are really time taking and often it is done manually in multiple steps such as, run site/documetnation generator on local machine then commit all changes to some branch and then push generated files to GitHub. How awesome it will be if you can automate these tasks? You just have to document your code and rest part will be automatically happen as soon as you push changes to GitHub. If you have used GitLab, this process is almost streamlined. Sadly GitHub doesn\'t natively support Python and other generators. GitHub only support Jekyll natively. \n\nNo more worries now. GitHub Action can do that. You just have to document your code and rest part will be automatically happen as soon as you push changes to GitHub. Currently Java and Python are supported. Support for other languages will be available soon. \n\n## How to automate these actions ? \n1.

A general configuration is given below. \n```yml\n    name: GitHub Pages Deploy Action\n    on:\n        # Branch name(s) which have the source file for site/documentation\n        push: [ <write-branch-here> ]\n    jobs:\n        deploy-pages:\n            name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n            runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n            steps:\n                # Use avinal/github-pages-deploy-action@<latest-release-tag> for latest stable release\n                # Do not change the line below except the word main with tag number maybe\n                - uses: avinal/github-pages-deploy-action@main\n                  with:\n                    # GitHub access token with Repo Access\n                    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}\n                    # For JavaDoc - ""java""\n                    # For python write python package and additional packages if any - ""python3 python3-pip"" \n                    LANGUAGE: ""<write-as-directed-above>""\n                    # Write make command to generate html e.g.- ""make html""\n                    MAKE_COMMAND: ""make html""\n                    # Write the branch name for storing github pages source \n                    PAGES_BRANCH: ""gh-pages""\n                    # Write the branch name having source files for site/documentation\n                    BUILD_FROM: ""master""\n                    # Write the name of the output folder where generated html is stored by makefile.\n                    DOCS_FOLDER: ""docs""\n```\n2. A Makefile with commands to generate html files. Given below are two simplest Makefiles for Java and Python Pelican Static Site generator. Feel free to add more configurations.\n    * Java\n        ```makefile\n            BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)\n            OUTPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/docs # you may change docs with custom folder name\n            PACKAGE=<your-java-package-name> # write the package name here\n\n            html:\n                javadoc ""$(PACKAGE)"" -d ""$(OUTPUTDIR)"" -encoding UTF-8\n\n            .PHONY: html\n        ```\n    You can add additional command line arguments to javadoc. \n    * Pelican static site generator (Python)\n        ```makefile\n            PY?=python3\n            PELICAN?=pelican\n            PELICANTHEME?=pelican-themes\n\n            BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)\n            INPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/content\n            OUTPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/output\n            THEMEDIR=$(BASEDIR)/themes/alchemy\n            CONFFILE=$(BASEDIR)/pelicanconf.py\n            PUBLISHCONF=$(BASEDIR)/publishconf.py\n\n            theme:\n\t            ""$(PELICANTHEME)"" --install ""$(THEMEDIR)""\n\n            html: theme\n                ""$(PELICAN)"" ""$(INPUTDIR)"" -o ""$(OUTPUTDIR)"" -s ""$(CONFFILE)"" $(PELICANOPTS)\n\n            .PHONY: theme html\n        ```\n    Most Python Static-site/documentation generators provides a default **Makefile**. You can use the same with minor changes.\n3. After this action is ran first time, a new branch will be created. You have to tell GitHub to use that branch for GitHub Pages. \n    * Goto your repository *Settings* and scroll down to *GitHub Pages.\n    * Under *Source* click on *Branch* drop-down menu and select the new branch(e.g- gh-pages) and click *Save*.\n    * A message will appear above this setting e.g - **Your site is published at https://avinal.github.io/**. This is your website address. You can now use it anywhere. \nFirst deployment may take up to 30 minutes to be published.\n\n**Hurray, You have successfully automated your site/documentation process \xf0\x9f\x98\x81**\n\n\n## Useful Awesome code snippets and tricks used in this GitHub Action\n1. Git\n    * Clone a single specific git branch\n        ```shell\n            git clone --single-branch --branch <branch-name> <remote-repository-url>\n        ```\n    * Create empty branch and publish\n        ```shell\n            git checkout --orphan <empty-branch-name>\n            git rm -rf .\n            git commit --allow-empty -m ""<commit-message>""\n            git push origin <empty-branch-name>\n        ```\n    * Reset every unstaged changes \n        ```shell\n            git reset --hard\n        ```\n2. Shell Script\n    * Use a command stored in a variable\n        ```shell\n            # let command be git branch -v\n            command=""git branch -v""\n            command_array=(${command})\n            ""${command_array[@]}""\n        ```\n    * Copy a folder with exact same directory-structure and files to another folder\n        ```shell\n            cp -a source/. destination\n        ```\n    * Install a package without recommended packages\n        ```shell\n            sudo apt install --no-install-recommends <package-name>\n        ```\n3. Docker\n    * Run commands in non interactive mode in Debian based containers while installing packages like tzdata\n    ```dockerfile\n        # add these to your Dockerfile\n        ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n        ENV TZ=<TimeZone>/<City>\n        # Now run\n        RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y tzdata <other-packages>\n    ```\n\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Default: `CHANGELOG.md` |\n| `release_notes_file` _(optional)_ | The output path of the (optional) release notes file.         |\n\n### Outputs\n\n| Output          | Description                |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|\n| `release_notes` | The escaped release notes. |\n\n### Example workflow - create a release with release notes\n\nOn every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `*.*.*`, extract the release notes from the `CHANGELOG.md` file and [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases):\n\n```yaml\nname: Create Release\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - '*.*.*'\n\njobs:\n  release:\n    name: Create release\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Extract release notes\n        id: extract-release-notes\n        uses: ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v1\n      - name: Create release\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: gh release create --notes '${{ steps.extract-release-notes.outputs.release_notes }}' --title ${{ github.ref_name }} ${{ github.ref_name }}\n```\n\nThis code will extract the content between the second and third H2 header from the `CHANGELOG.md` file, store this content in the output variable `release_notes` and create a release using the [`gh release create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create) command.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Use a dedicated changelog file\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Extract release notes\n        id: extract-release-notes\n        uses: ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v1\n        with:\n          changelog_file: MY_CHANGELOG.md\n```\n\n### Create a release notes file\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Extract release notes\n        uses: ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v1\n        with:\n          release_notes_file: RELEASE_NOTES.md\n```\n\n### Extract prerelease notes\n\nTo extract the content between the first (`## [Unreleased]`) and second H2 header, set the `prerelease` parameter to `true`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Extract release notes\n        uses: ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v1\n        with:\n          prerelease: true\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
631,"b'[![JFrog CLI](readme_image.png)](#readme)\n\n<div align=""center"">\n\n# Setup JFrog CLI\n\n[![Scanned by Frogbot](https://raw.github.com/jfrog/frogbot/master/images/frogbot-badge.svg)](https://github.com/jfrog/frogbot#readme)\n[![Build status](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/actions)\n\n</div>\n\nThis GitHub Action downloads, installs and configures JFrog CLI, so that it can be used as part of the workflow.\n\nIn addition, the Action includes the following features, when using JFrog CLI to work with JFrog Platform.\n* The connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets. Read more about it [here](#Storing-JFrog-Connection-Details-as-Secrets).\n* There\'s no need to add the *build name* and *build number* options and arguments to commands which accept them.\nAll build related operations will be automatically recorded with the *Workflow Name* as build name and *Run Number* as build number.\n\n# Usage\n## General\n\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n- run: jf --version\n```\n\n## Storing JFrog connection details as secrets\nThe connection details of the JFrog platform used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets.\nYou can use one of the following two methods to define and store the JFrog Platform connection details as secrets.\n1. [Storing the connection details using separate environment variables](#Storing-the-connection-details-using-separate-environment-variables).\n2. [Storing the connection details using single Config Token](#Storing-the-connection-details-using-single-Config-Token).\n\n### Storing the connection details using separate environment variables\nYou can set the connection details to your JFrog Platform by using one of the following environment variables combinations:\n1. JF_URL (no authentication)\n2. JF_URL + JF_USER + JF_PASSWORD (basic authentication)\n3. JF_URL + JF_ACCESS_TOKEN (authentication using a JFrog Access Token)\n\nYou can use these environment variables in your workflow as follows:\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n  env:\n    # JFrog platform url (for example: https://acme.jfrog.io) \n    JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}\n    \n    # Basic authentication credentials\n    JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}\n    JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}\n    or\n    # JFrog Platform access token\n    JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n- run: |\n    jf rt ping\n```\n\n| Important: If both Config Token(JF_ENV_*) and separate environment variables(JF_URL, ...) are provided, the default config will be the Config Token. To make the above separate environment variables as the default config use ```jf c use setup-jfrog-cli-server``` |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n### Storing the connection details using single Config Token\n1. Make sure JFrog CLI is installed on your local machine by running ```jf -v```.\n2. Configure the details of the JFrog platform by running ```jf c add```.\n3. Export the details of the JFrog platform you configured, using the server ID you chose. Do this by running ```jf c export <SERVER ID>```.\n4. Copy the generated Config Token to the clipboard and save it as a secret on GitHub.\n\nTo use the saved JFrog platform configuration in the workflow, all you need to do it to expose the secret to the workflow.\nThe secret should be exposed as an environment variable with the *JF_ENV_* prefix.\nHere\'s how you do this:\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n  env:\n    JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}\n- run: |\n    # Ping the server\n    jf rt ping\n```\nAs you can see in the example above, we created a secret named *JF_SECRET_ENV_1* and exposed it to the workflow \nas the *JF_ENV_1* environment variable. That\'s it - the ping command will now ping the configured Artifactory server.\n\nIf you have multiple Config Tokens as secrets, you can use all of them in the workflow as follows:\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n  env:\n    JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}\n    JF_ENV_2: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_2 }}\n- run: |\n    # Set the JFrog configuration to use by providing the server ID (configured by the \'jf c add\' command).\n    jf c use local-1\n    # Ping local-1 Artifactory server\n    jf rt ping\n    # Now use the second sever configuration exposed to the Action.\n    jf c use local-2\n    # Ping local-2 Artifactory server\n    jf rt ping\n```\n| Important: When exposing more than one JFrog configuration to the Action, you should always add the ```jf c use``` command to specify the server to use. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n## Setting the build name and build number when publishing build-info to Artifactory\nThe Action automatically sets the following environment variables:\n*JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NAME* and *JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NUMBER* with the workflow name and run number respectively.\nYou therefore don\'t need to specify the build name and build number on any of the build related JFrog CLI commands.\n\nIn the following example, all downloaded files are registered as dependencies of the build and all uploaded files\nare registered as the build artifacts. \n```yml\n- run: |\n    jf rt dl artifacts/\n    jf rt u aether artifacts/\n    jf rt bp\n```\n\n## Setting JFrog CLI version\nBy default, the JFrog CLI version set in [action.yml](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/blob/master/action.yml) is used. To set a specific version, add the *version* input as follows:\n\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n  with:\n    version: X.Y.Z\n```\n\nIt is also possible to set the latest JFrog CLI version by adding the *version* input as follows:\n\n```yml\n- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n  with:\n    version: latest\n```\n\n| Important: Only JFrog CLI versions 1.29.0 or above are supported. |\n| --- |\n\n## Downloading JFrog CLI from Artifactory\nIf your agent has no Internet access, you can configure the workflow to download JFrog CLI from a [remote repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Remote+Repositories) in your JFrog Artifactory, which is configured to proxy the official download URL.\n\nHere\'s how you do this:\n\n1. Create a remote repository in Artifactory. Name the repository jfrog-cli-remote and set its URL to https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/\n2. Set *download-repository* input to jfrog-cli-remote:\n    ```yml\n    - uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v3\n      env:\n       # JFrog platform url (for example: https://acme.jfrog.io) \n        JF_URL: ${{ secrets.JF_URL }}\n    \n        # Basic authentication credentials\n        JF_USER: ${{ secrets.JF_USER }}\n        JF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.JF_PASSWORD }}\n    \n        # JFrog platform access token (if JF_USER and JF_PASSWORD are not provided)\n        # JF_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JF_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n   \n        # Same can be achieved with a Config Token using JF_ENV_1 environment variable\n        # JF_ENV_1: ${{ secrets.JF_SECRET_ENV_1 }}\n      with:\n        download-repository: jfrog-cli-remote\n    ```\n\n* See instructions for configuring the JFrog connection details under [Storing JFrog connection details as secrets](#storing-jfrog-connection-details-as-secrets).\n\n\n## Set up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud\nNeed a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud to use with this GitHub Action?

The prefix will **not** be excluded from the result.\n\n* **`regex: \'regex pattern\'`**\n\n  Consider only tags that match the specified regular expression pattern (not anchored).\n  For example, `regex: \'^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$\'` matches tags such as `1.2.3` etc.\n\n* **`sort-tags: true`** (default)\n\n  Look through all tags to find the one with the [greatest (semver-like) version](#version-precedence).\n\n* **`sort-tags: false`** (default for `releases-only: true`)\n\n  Return the first tag reported by GitHub. It\'s safe to rely on this being the **most recently created** release only for `releases-only: false`. When looking at tags, the behavior is undefined.\n\n* **`token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}`**\n\n  Required for scanning tags of **other private repositories** (referred to as *destination* repo), because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` only gives access to the repository that\'s *running* the action (and public ones).\n\n  Then a user that has access to the destination repository needs to [create](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `repo` access, and that token\'s value should be [added as a repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to the *running* repository under the name ""`PERSONAL_TOKEN`"".\n\n  See also: [Example](https://github.com/oprypin/find-latest-tag/blob/85ce4ccf033896cde4cd274773bacb49758cca11/.github/workflows/release.yml#L26-L31), [Security considerations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#considering-cross-repository-access).\n\n### Outputs\n\n* **`tag`** (`${{ steps.some_step_id.outputs.tag }}`)\n\n  The tag that was found is made available as the step\'s output.\n\n### Errors\n\nThe action exits with an error if:\n\n* the `repository` input is invalid;\n* any HTTP error happens;\n    * the repository doesn\'t exist;\n    * the repository isn\'t public;\n* no tags (or releases, if that\'s what chosen) are found;\n* none of the tags match the `prefix`.\n\n## Version precedence\n\nThe action looks at tags in [natural sort order][] (i.e. lexicographic with the consideration of multi-digit numbers), with a special exception for ""pre-release identifiers"" (letters that immediately follow a number).\n\nExample in ascending order:\n\n* `v1.3` (goes first just because others don\'t have the ""v"")\n* `1.1.2` (lowest minor version)\n* `1.2rc1` (precedes the following as a ""release candidate"" of 1.2)\n* `1.2` (actual release)\n* `1.2.1` (patch release)\n* `1.11` (much later version; `11 > 2` even if `\'1\' < \'2\'`)\n\n(and so `1.11` would be chosen as the ""greatest"").\n\nThis handling is compatible with [SemVer][], but more general.\n\nThere is no attempt to isolate the version number from other text that may be part of the tag name. But that\'s not a problem if the tags have a matching prefix, e.g. `Release-1.2.3` and `Release-1.2.4`. But, `Foo-3.4.5` would precede these just because `\'F\' < \'R\'`.\n\n\n[github action]: https://github.com/features/actions\n[natural sort order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order\n[semver]: https://semver.org/\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

It is recommended to stop using this wrapper script and migrate to native Semgrep support instead. Refer to the [GitHub Actions configuration document](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file). |\n\nSemgrep Action runs Semgrep in CI environments. It can also connect to Semgrep App to configure rules and review findings on a web UI.\n\nTo see all the configuration options, [check Semgrep docs](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs/#sample-github-actions-configuration-file).\nSemgrep Action runs [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) in CI environments.\nIt can also connect to [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-app) to configure rules and review findings on a web UI.\n\n- **Scan every commit.** Semgrep CI rapidly scans modified files on pull and merge requests, protecting developer productivity. Longer full project scans are configurable on merges to specific branches.\n- **Block new bugs.** You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to fix existing bugs just to adopt a tool. Semgrep CI reports newly introduced issues on pull and merge requests, scanning them at their base and HEAD commits to compare findings. Developers are signficantly more likely to fix the issues they introduced themselves on PRs and MRs.\n- **Get findings where you work.** Semgrep CI can connect to Semgrep App to present findings in Slack, on PRs and MRs via inline comments, email, and through 3rd party services.\n\n> Semgrep runs fully in your build environment: code is never sent anywhere.\n\n## Getting started\n\nSemgrep behaves like other static analysis and linting tools:\nit runs a set of user-configured rules and returns a non-zero exit code if there are findings,\nresulting in its job showing a \xe2\x9c\x85 or \xe2\x9d\x8c.\n\nRefer to [Getting started with Semgrep in CI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/overview/) to set up a CI job with Semgrep.\n\nOnce Semgrep Action is running, [explore the Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r) to find and add more project-specific rules.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee the [Semgrep in CI configuration reference](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/configuration-reference/) for further customizations, such as scanning with custom rules, ignoring files, and tuning performance.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSemgrep collects opt-out non-identifiable aggregate metrics for improving the user experience, guiding Semgrep feature development, and identifying regressions.\n\nThe [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) file describes the principles that guide our data-collection decisions, the breakdown of the data that are and are not collected, and how to opt-out of Semgrep CI\xe2\x80\x99s metrics.\n\n> Semgrep never sends your source code anywhere.\n\n## Technical details\n\n### Packaging\n\nThe [Semgrep Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/semgrep-action) GitHub Marketplace listing\nruns the [`semgrep-agent` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/returntocorp/semgrep-agent).\n\nNew versions of Semgrep CI and the Docker image above are released by Semgrep maintainers on a regular basis.\nTo run all jobs with the latest releases, use the `returntocorp/semgrep` Docker image, or the `returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1` action.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

size to 63 characters\n- remove trailing `-` characters\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Others <b>Slug-ish</b> commands are available</summary>\n  <p>\n\n- `SLUG_URL` on a variable to have a `slug` variable compliant to be used in an URL\n  - Like `SLUG` but `.`, and `_` are also replaced by `-`\n- `SHORT` on a variable will limit the string size to ~8 characters\n  - Useful for _sha_ value\n- `<KEY>_PART` on a variable will give a part of a variable defined by a key\n  - Like `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER_PART` for the owner part of `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`\n- `<VAR>_CS` on others variables to keep the value case-sensitive\n  - Like `GITHUB_REF_SLUG_CS`\n\nAdditional enhanced environment variables can be compute to help you around GitHub environment variables.\n  </p>\n</details>\n\n## Use this

```yaml\n  - name: Inject slug/short variables\n    uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4\n    with:\n      slug-maxlength: 80 # Use 'nolimit' to remove use of a max length (Default to 63)\n  ```\n\n- With another length for short values\n\n  ```yaml\n  - name: Inject slug/short variables\n    uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4\n    with:\n      short-length: 7 # By default it's up to git to decide, use 8 to have the v3.x behavior\n  ```\n\n  **Warning**: If you leave it empty, you need to checkout the source first in order to let git decide the size by itself.\n  </p>\n</details>\n\nCheck for more [examples][examples] (OS usage, URL use, ...)\n\n**Tip:** Use [Dependabot][dependabot] to maintain your `github-slug-action` version updated in your GitHub workflows.\n\n### Migration from previous versions\n\nThe short sha length is not the same as previous version.\n\n- `v4` let git configuration decide of it (but you can override it),\n- `v3` and before, it's always a length of 8 characters.\n\nSo to reproduce previous behavior, use\n\n```yaml\n- name: Inject slug/short variables\n  uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4\n  with:\n    short-length: 8 # Same as v3 and before\n```\n\n## Available Environment variables\n\n**Note**: If you don't find what you search for, read more about [available `GitHub` variables](docs/github-variables.md), and propose a [new custom variable][custom-variable].\n\n### Enhanced variables\n\n- `GITHUB_REF_NAME` will contains the reference name (branch or tag)\n  - based on `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` in a [`pull-request*`][webhooks-and-events] event context,\n  - based on `GITHUB_REF` in others event context.\n\n**NOTE:** All enhanced variables are available in all **slug**

variables doesn't have the same lengths as before\n\nSince `v4`, it's git who manage the short variables by using [git rev-parse][git-revparse] behaviour.\nThe length of a short sha depends of the size of our repository and can differ over time.\n\nTo manage that moving length, you can use `short-length` input\n\n- set `7` to reproduce `small repository` behavior\n- set `8` to reproduce `v3` behavior\n\n**Warning**: The minimum length is 4, the default is the effective value of the [core.abbrev][git-core-abbrev] configuration variable.\n\n### One of the environment variables doesn't work as intended\n\n[**Note**][naming-conventions]: When you set a custom environment variable, you cannot use any of the default environment variable names. For a complete list of these, see [Default environment variables][default-environment-variables]. **If you attempt to override the value of one of these default environment variables, the assignment is ignored.**\n\nIf a variable start to be used as default environment variable, the environment variable may have a different behavior than the expected one.\n\nIf this append, the `${{ env.GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE }}` and `$GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE` expression will not works in the same way.\n\n- `${{ env.GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE }}` will serve the behavior of this action,\n- `$GITHUB_AWESOME_VARIABLE` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.\n\nOtherwise the two expression will serve the behavior of this action.\nThis will not occurs if you use the `prefix` input to avoid the issue.\n\n**NOTE:** If detected, the maintainers of this action will choose the best course of action depending of the impact.\n\n#### Known environment variable conflicts\n\n##### GITHUB_REF_NAME\n\nThe behavior is the same as the GitHub one except on `pull_request*` workflows ([Ready the full story][issue-104]).\n\n- `${{ env.GITHUB_REF_NAME }}` will serve the behavior of this action,\n- `$GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.\n\nOn `pull_request*` workflows, the content will be `<PR-number>/merge` instead of the branch name.\n\nA possible workaround is to use `prefix` input\n\n```yaml\n- name: Inject slug/short variables\n  uses: rlespinasse/github-slug-action@v4\n  with:\n    prefix: CI_\n```\n\nThen `${{ env.CI_GITHUB_REF_NAME }}`, and `$CI_GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of this action.\nAnd `$GITHUB_REF_NAME` will serve the behavior of GitHub Action.\n\n### An action could not be found at the URI\n\nIf your workflow fail on the `Set up job` task with this kind of log\n\n```text\nDownload action repository 'rlespinasse/github-slug-action@GIT_REFERENCE'\n##[error]An action could not be found at the URI 'https://api.github.com/repos/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/tarball/GIT_REFERENCE'\n```\n\nIf the `GIT_REFERENCE` value is\n\n- `v4.x` or after, the branch don't exists anymore following the [end-of-life for a branch](SECURITY.md#end-of-life-of-a-branch) security process.\n- `master`, the branch don't exists anymore, read more about it on the corresponding issue ([EOL issue][issue-15])\n\nPlease, use the current major tag `v4` or a version tag (see [releases pages][releases]) in order to fix your workflow.\n\n## Thanks for talking about us\n\nIn English :gb:\n\n-

([#3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/setup-bazelisk/issues/3))\n* Windows removes one of the slashes (`/`) when two are present (`bazel test //tests/...` becomes `bazel test /tests/...` and fails).

If this action is part of a chain of steps, and you want to \npush the changes later, by yourself, you can disable this behavior with the parameter `commit: 'false'`.\n- The input and output file can be either a `template -> definitive` or `definitive -> definitive`; this just means that\n the input and output may be the same file. The later attempts to replace, by this action, will 'fail' safely without an\n  Error code.\n\n# Why use this action?\n\nI know there are other actions that accomplish the same objective, but:\n\n- This is self-contained (only needs to be preceded by actions/checkout)\n- It is plain JavaScript, few lines of code, easy to inspect and see that this action only does what it does.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nCreate a YAML file at `.github/workflows/myworkflow.yml`\n> GITHUB_TOKEN must be set, otherwise this action cannot perform changes in your repository.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: franzbischoff/replace_envs@v1\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE: 'some value'\n    with:\n      from_file: 'README.md'\n      to_file: 'README.md'\n      commit: 'true'\n```\n\n# Code of Conduct\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

643,"b'# rsync deployments\n\nThis GitHub Action deploys files in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to a folder on a server via rsync over ssh. \n\nThis action would usually follow a build/test action which leaves deployable code in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.\n\n# Required secrets\n\nThis action needs a `DEPLOY_KEY` secret variable. This should be the private key part of an ssh key pair. The public key part should be added to the authorized_keys file on the server that receives the deployment.\n\n# Required inputs\n\nThis action requires six inputs:\n\n1. `FLAGS` for any initial/required rsync flags, eg: `-avzr --delete`\n\n2. `EXCLUDES` for any `--exclude` flags and directory pairs, eg: `--exclude .htaccess --exclude /uploads/`. Use `""""` if none required.\n\n3. `USER` for the server user, eg: `deploybot`\n\n4. `HOST` for the deployment target, eg: `myserver.com`\n\n5. `LOCALPATH` for the local path to sync, eg: `/dist/`\n\n5. `REMOTEPATH` for the remote path to sync, eg: `/srv/myapp/public/htdocs/`\n\n# Example usage\n\n```\nname: Deploy to production\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: contention/rsync-deployments@v2.0.0\n        with:\n          FLAGS: -avzr --delete\n          EXCLUDES: --exclude .htaccess --exclude /uploads/\n          USER deploybot\n          HOST: myserver.com\n          LOCALPATH: /dist/\n          REMOTEPATH: /srv/myapp/public/htdocs/\n          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n\n```\n\n## REMINDER! \n\nCheck your keys.

The\nWrapper is a script that downloads and invokes a declared Gradle version. By\nchecking the Wrapper into version control you make the build process more\nstandardised, easy and reliable.\n\nMaintaining dependencies up-to-date is regarded as a good practice, and the\nbuild system files should be no exception. Unfortunately, often times developers\nadd the Wrapper to the project repository once and just forget about it.\n\nThe Update Gradle Wrapper Action aims to help keeping Gradle projects on GitHub\npolished to high standards and to strengthen the software supply chain in the\nGradle ecosystem.\n\n### Hygiene\n\nGradle is under heavy development, with new releases available every few weeks.\nProjects that stick to old Wrapper versions can\'t benefit from the tons of\nfeatures and bug fixes being rolled out.\n\nUpdating the build system only once or twice per year might become a tedious\ntask. You will need to walk through longer changelogs and handle any breaking\nchange. Updating frequently helps do less work, take advantage of new features\nearlier and safely drop deprecated functionality.\n\nThis action runs automatically at the declared schedule and creates Pull\nRequests with detailed information about the version update.\n\n![Pull Request\ndescription](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316923/93386801-8af7bc00-f868-11ea-8bfb-3a931a596590.png\n""Pull Request with Release Notes"")\n\n### Security\n\nAt the hearth of the Gradle Wrapper script is a `.jar` binary blob of executable\ncode. Checking that blob into a repository makes the developer experience quite\nconvenient but has important security implications.\n\nA `gradle-wrapper.jar` that has been tampered with could execute or fetch any\narbitrary code. Pull Requests that update the Wrapper are genuinely hard to\nreview, as GitHub will show an empty binary diff.\n\n![Empty binary\ndiff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316923/93386924-b7abd380-f868-11ea-9f95-74cbf2ffeb80.png\n""gradle-wrapper.jar shows an empty diff"")\n\nThis action verifies the integrity of the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file being\nupdated by comparing its SHA-256 checksum against the official checksum value\npublished by Gradle authors. Moreover, the action configures the Wrapper so that\nthe Gradle executable itself can be verified once it is downloaded locally.\n\n## Action inputs\n\nThis is the list of supported inputs:\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`repo-token`](#repo-token) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope. | No | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| [`reviewers`](#reviewers) | List of users to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n| [`team-reviewers`](#team-reviewers) | List of teams to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n| [`labels`](#labels) | List of labels to set on the Pull Request (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n| [`base-branch`](#base-branch) | Base branch where the action will run and update the Gradle Wrapper. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |\n| [`target-branch`](#target-branch) | Branch to create the Pull Request against. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |\n| [`paths`](#paths) | List of paths where to search for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n| [`paths-ignore`](#paths-ignore) | List of paths to be excluded when searching for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n| [`set-distribution-checksum`](#set-distribution-checksum) | Whether to set the `distributionSha256Sum` property. | No | `true` |\n| [`release-channel`](#release-channel) | Which Gradle release channel to use: either `stable` or `release-candidate`. | No | `stable` |\n| [`merge-method`](#merge-method) | Which merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). Valid values include `MERGE`, `REBASE`, or `SQUASH`.  If unset, automerge will not be enabled on opened PRs. | No | (unset) No auto-merge |\n\n---\n\n### `repo-token`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `repo-token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope. | No | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n\nSet the authorisation token used by the action to perform tasks through the\nGitHub API and to execute authenticated git commands.\n\nIf empty, it defaults to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that is installed in your\nrepository, which is equivalent to the following configuration:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nNote that, when using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, Pull Requests created by the Update\nGradle Wrapper action cannot trigger any workflow run in your repository. This\nis a restriction of GitHub Actions to avoid accidentally creating recursive\nworkflow runs ([read\nmore](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)).\n\nSo, for example, if you have any `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflow that\nruns CI checks on Pull Requests, they won\'t be triggered if the `repo-token` is\nleft empty or if you set it to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n\nThe recommended workaround is to [create a Personal Access Token\n(PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\nwith `repo` scope and add it [as a\nsecret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)\ninto your repository. Then, set the `repo-token` to access your secret PAT:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  repo-token: ${{ secrets.GRADLE_UPDATE_PAT }}\n```\n\nRead this [paragraph](#running-ci-workflows-in-pull-requests-created-by-the-action) for more details on the topic.\n\n---\n\n### `reviewers`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `reviewers` | List of users to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n\nRequest a review from these GitHub usernames (notifications will be triggered).\n\nFor example, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  reviewers: username1, username2\n```\n\nor add each reviewer on a different line (no comma needed):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  reviewers: |\n    username1\n    username2\n```\n\nNote that if you\'re using a Personal Access Token (PAT) as `repo-token` you cannot request a review from the user that the PAT belongs to.\n\n---\n\n### `team-reviewers`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `team-reviewers` | List of teams to request a review from (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n\nRequest a review from these teams (notifications will be triggered).\n\nFor example, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  team-reviewers: team1, team2\n```\n\nor add each team on a different line (no comma needed):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  team-reviewers: |\n    team1\n    team2\n```\n\nNote that you might need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) as `repo-token` in order to request a review from a team in your organisation.\n\n---\n\n### `labels`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `labels` | List of labels to set on the Pull Request (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n\nAdd custom labels to the Pull Request.\n\nFor example, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  labels: automated pr, dependencies\n```\n\nor add each label on a different line (no comma needed):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  labels: |\n    automated pr\n    dependencies\n```\n\nLabel names can include spaces. Note that the action will create a label if it doesn\'t already exist within your organisation.\n\n---\n\n### `base-branch`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `base-branch` | Base branch where the action will run and update the Gradle Wrapper. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |\n\nThe name of the branch used as a base when running the update process. The action will switch (i.e. `git checkout`) to this branch before updating the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file. By default the repository\'s ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" is used (most commonly `master`).\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  base-branch: gradle-testing\n```\n\n---\n\n### `target-branch`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `target-branch` | Branch to create Pull Requests against. | No | The default branch name of your repository. |\n\nThe name of the branch to push changes into. By default the repository\'s ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" is used (most commonly `master`).\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  target-branch: unstable\n```\n\n---\n\n### `paths`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `paths` | List of paths where to search for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n\nBy default all Gradle Wrapper files in the source tree will be autodiscovered and considered for update. Use `paths` to provide a specific list of paths where to look for `gradle-wrapper.jar`.\n\nFor example, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths: project-web/**, project-backend/**\n```\n\nor add each path on a different line (no comma needed):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths: |\n    project-web/**\n    project-backend/**\n```\n\nThis input accepts glob patterns that use characters like `*` and `**`, for more information see [GitHub\'s cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet).\n\n`paths` and `paths-ignore` can be used together. `paths` is always evaluated before `paths-ignore`, look at [this example](#using-paths-and-paths-ignore-together).\n\n---\n\n### `paths-ignore`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `paths-ignore` | List of paths to be excluded when searching for Gradle Wrapper files (comma or newline-separated). | No | (empty) |\n\nBy default all Gradle Wrapper files in the source tree will be autodiscovered and considered for update. Use `paths-ignore` to specify paths that should be ignored during scan.\n\nFor example, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths-ignore: project-docs/**, project-examples/**\n```\n\nor add each path on a different line (no comma needed):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths-ignore: |\n    project-docs/**\n    project-examples/**\n```\n\nThis input accepts glob patterns that use characters like `*` and `**`, for more information see [GitHub\'s cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet).\n\n`paths` and `paths-ignore` can be used together. `paths-ignore` is always evaluated after `paths`, look at [this example](#using-paths-and-paths-ignore-together).\n\n---\n\n### `set-distribution-checksum`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `set-distribution-checksum` | Whether to set the `distributionSha256Sum` property. | No | `true` |\n\nThe Gradle Wrapper provides a way to increase security against attackers\ntampering with the Gradle distribuition file you download locally.\nIf the `distributionSha256Sum` property is added to\n`gradle-wrapper.properties`, Gradle will report a build failure in case the\nspecified checksum doesn\'t match the checksum of the distribution downloaded\nfrom server (this is only performed once, the first time you download a new\nGradle version).\n\nThe Update Gradle Wrapper action sets the expected checksum for you. If you\nwant to disable this behaviour change the `set-distribution-checksum` input\nto `false`.\n\nIt is not recommended to change this value unless you\'ve got a very specific\nneed (e.g. [Android Studio warnings](#android-studio-warning-about-distributionsha256sum)).\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  set-distribution-checksum: false\n```\n\n---\n\n### `release-channel`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `release-channel` | Which release channel to use: `stable` or `release-candidate`. | No | `stable` |\n\nGradle\'s release channel used to update. By default `stable` is used which corresponds to the latest stable release.\nAlternatively, `release-candidate` can be used to update to the most recent release candidate.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  release-channel: release-candidate\n```\n### `merge-method`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`merge-method`](#merge-method) | Which merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). Valid values include `MERGE`, `REBASE`, or `SQUASH`.  If unset, automerge will not be enabled on opened PRs. | No | (unset) No auto-merge |\n\nThe merge method to use for [auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request). By default auto-merge will not be enabled; set this to one of the valid merge methods to enable auto-merge.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  merge-method: SQUASH\n```\n### `pr-title-template`\n\n| Name | Description | Required | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `pr-title-template` | The template to use for the title of the pull request created by this action | No | `Update Gradle Wrapper from %sourceVersion% to %targetVersion%` |\n\nThis input is used for the title of the pull request created by this action. This allows, for example, for better integration into repositories which make use of commit message patterns like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).\n\n`%sourceVersion%` and `%targetVersion%` will be replaced by the current/old and the new version of the Gradle Wrapper\nrespectively.\n\nThere are cases in which the source version of the Gradle Wrapper can not be determined successfully. In such cases, the string \'undefined\' will be used to replace the source version placeholder.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  pr-title-template: \'chore(deps): Bump Gradle Wrapper from %sourceVersion% to %targetVersion%\'\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Scheduling action execution\n\nYou should run this action on a dedicated workflow using a `schedule` trigger\nevent:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    # every day at 2am\n    - cron: ""0 2 * * *""\n```\n\nor\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    # every week on Monday at 8am\n    - cron: ""0 8 * * MON""\n```\n\nUse the [POSIX cron\nsyntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events)\nto specify your preferred time or frequency (tip: check your value is correct\nwith [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/examples.html)).\n\nIt is not recommended to run the action more frequently than once a day.\n\n### Targeting a custom branch\n\nThe action will create Pull Requests against the ""[default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories)"" of your repository (say, `master` or any other branch you\'ve configured).\n\nIf you want Pull Requests to be created against a non-default branch use the `target-branch` input:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  target-branch: v2-dev\n```\n\n### Updating to the latest Release Candidate version\n\nThe action supports more Gradle release channels. By default, when the action runs it will check for the latest `stable` release. If your project depends on the release candidate version of Gradle, use `release-channel` to configure which release information to download:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  release-channel: release-candidate\n```\n\n### Ignoring subprojects folders with `paths-ignore`\n\nThere are cases where your repository contains folders for projects or subprojects that need to be kept at an older Gradle version.\n\nIf you want to ignore such files when the action runs, use `paths-ignore` to configure project paths that contain Gradle Wrapper files that should not be updated.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths-ignore: examples/**\n```\n\n### Using `paths` and `paths-ignore` together\n\n`paths` and `paths-ignore` works as allowlist and blocklist systems. The evaluation rule is as follows:\n\n- the source tree is searched for all `gradle-wrapper.jar` files and the list is passed to the next step\n- if `paths` is not empty, the paths that match the specified patterns are passed to the next step\n- if `paths-ignore` is not empty, the paths that match the specified patterns are removed from the list\n\nFor example, the following configuration will search for Gradle Wrapper files in the `sub-project` directory and its subdirectories, but not in the `sub-project/examples` directory.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  paths: sub-project/**\n  paths-ignore: sub-project/examples/**\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Running CI workflows in Pull Requests created by the action\n\nBy default, if the `repo-token` input is left empty or if you set it to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, Pull Requests created by the Update Gradle Wrapper action do not trigger any other workflow. So, for example, if you have any `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflow that runs CI checks on Pull Requests, they won\'t normally be triggered.\n\nThis is a restriction imposed by GitHub Actions to avoid accidentally creating recursive workflow runs ([read more](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)).\n\nHere is what you can do to trigger additional workflows:\n\n- Manual trigger: when you use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` the Pull Request won\'t run any of the configured workflows, but you can manually close and immediately reopen the Pull Request to trigger the `on: pull_request` workflows.\n\n- Use a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token): create a PAT with the `repo` scope and add it [as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) into your repository. Then configure the [`repo-token`](#repo-token) input to use such encrypted secret. Note that the Pull Request author will be set to the GitHub user that the PAT belongs to: as Pull Request author, this user cannot be assigned as reviewer and cannot approve it.\n\n- Use a Personal Access Token of a dedicated account: use a PAT that belongs to a machine account with collaborator access to your repository.\n\n### Android Studio warning about `distributionSha256Sum`\n\nYou might get a warning message in Android Studio that looks like this:\n\n> It is not fully supported to define distributionSha256Sum in gradle-wrapper.properties.\n\nThis refers to the presence of the `distributionSha256Sum` property into\n`gradle-wrapper.properties`, which Update Gradle Wrapper action sets by default\nto increase security against the risk of the Gradle distribution being tampered\nwith.\n\nIt is totally safe to disable the warning in Android Studio, just choose the option:\n\n> Use ""..."" as checksum for https://.../gradle-6.6.1-bin.zip and sync project\n\nOn the other hand, if for some reason you prefer to avoid the\n`distributionSha256Sum` property being set automatically by the action use the\n[`set-distribution-checksum`](#set-distribution-checksum):\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  # not recommended\n  set-distribution-checksum: false\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nDebug logs are disabled by default in GitHub actions.

648,"b'# Has Changed Path - GitHub Action\n\n<p align=""left"">\n  <a href=""https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/actions""><img alt=""has-changed-path status"" src=""https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/workflows/unit-tests/badge.svg""></a>\n</p>\n\nThis action outputs whether a path or combination of paths has changed in the previous commit.\n\nIt solves a common issue among monorepo setups: conditional actions. Deploying a project that did not change in the previous commit could be a waste of time and resources.\n\nWith this action, **you know if a deployment or any other job needs to run based on the changed paths of the most recent commit.**\n\nIt differs from [GitHub\'s paths](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) as our action is meant to be used inside your job steps, not at the root of your workflow file (see [this issue](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Path-filtering-for-jobs-and-steps/td-p/33617)).\n\nMy recommendation is to put this action in a workflow that runs on every push to `master`.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `paths` (required): Path to detect changes. It\'s possible to pass one path, a combination or a wildcard. Valid options include: `packages/front`, `packages/front packages/shared`, `packages/**/tests`. See workflow examples below for more information.\n\n## Outputs\n\n- `changed`: boolean indicating if the paths changed at the latest commit\n\n## Example workflows\n\n### Important info:\n\nNotice that **you must configure `fetch-depth` in your `actions/checkout@v2`**. That\'s because their default option now is to fetch only the latest commit instead of all history ([more info](https://github.com/actions/checkout))\n\nIf you want to fetch all history, pass `fetch-depth: 0`.\n\nFor monorepo packages, where history tends to be larger than single repos, it may take a while fetching all of it. That\'s why we used `fetch-depth: 100` in the examples. It will fetch the latest 100 commits.\n\n### Detecting a simple one-path change:\n\n```yaml\nname: Conditional Deploy\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 100\n\n      - uses: marceloprado/has-changed-path@v1.0.1\n        id: changed-front\n        with:\n          paths: packages/front\n\n      - name: Deploy front\n        if: steps.changed-front.outputs.changed == \'true\'\n        run: /deploy-front.sh\n```\n\n### Detecting changes in multiple paths:\n\nUseful when you have dependencies between packages (eg. `/common` package used in `/front` and `/server`).\nBelow, the output would be truthy for any given change inside `packages/front` **or** `packages/common`.\n\n```yaml\nname: Conditional Deploy\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 100\n\n      - uses: marceloprado/has-changed-path@v1.0.1\n        id: changed-front\n        with:\n          paths: packages/front packages/common\n\n      - name: Deploy front\n        if: steps.changed-front.outputs.changed == \'true\'\n        run: /deploy-front.sh\n```\n\n### Detecting a one-path change with checkout multiple repos:\n\n```yaml\nname: Conditional Deploy\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 100\n          path: main\n\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 100\n          repsitory: my-org/my-tools\n          path: my-tools\n\n      - uses: marceloprado/has-changed-path@v1.0.1\n        id: changed-main\n        with:\n          paths: packages/front\n        env:\n          SOURCE: main\n\n      - uses: marceloprado/has-changed-path@v1.0.1\n        id: changed-my-tools\n        with:\n          paths: somewhere/else\n        env:\n          SOURCE: my-tools\n\n      - name: Deploy main\n        if: steps.changed-main.outputs.changed == \'true\'\n        run: /deploy-main.sh\n\n      - name: Deploy my tools\n        if: steps.changed-my-tools.outputs.changed == \'true\'\n        run: /deploy-my-tools.sh\n```\n\n## How it works?\n\nThe action itself is pretty simple - take a look at [`src/hasChanged.js`](https://github.com/MarceloPrado/has-changed-path/blob/master/src/hasChanged.js) ;) .\n\nBasically, we compare the latest HEAD with the previous one using `git diff` command. This allows us to effectively detect changes in most cases (squashed merges and merges with merge commit).\n\nThe algorithm works very similar with [Netlify\'s default way](https://community.netlify.com/t/monorepo-and-long-builds/7234/2) for detecting changes in monorepo builds.\n\n## Contribute\n\nHave any thoughts or suggestions?

Manually copy and pasting each code snippet in their respective places in your README would be inefficient and time-consuming.\n\nThis problem can be solved using <b>markdown-autodocs</b> a GitHub Action that automatically generates & updates markdown content (like your README.md) from external or remote files. You need to add markers in your README.md that will tell markdown-autodocs where to insert the code snippet.\n\n## Features\n*   <b>Code block:</b> Insert code snippet in your markdown file from external or remote files.\n*   <b>JSON to HTML table:</b> Insert HTML Table in your markdown file by converting JSON file contents to HTML table.\n*   <b>Github Workflow Artifacts table:</b> Insert the Github workflow artifacts table in your markdown file by getting the latest artifacts for a workflow run.\n\n## Examples\n\n### CODE Block\n\nGet code from an external file or URL and insert it in your markdown.\n\n**Options:**\n* `src`: The relative path to the code to pull in, or the `URL` where the raw code lives\n* `lines` (optional): a range with lines of code which will then be replaced with code from the file. The line range should be defined as: ""lines=*startLine*-*EndLine*"" (for example: ""lines=22-44"").

650,"b'# Sticky Pull Request Comment\n\nCreate a comment on a pull request, if it exists update that comment.\nThis library runs with GitHub Actions. If you feel that the example grammar below is not friendly enough, we recommend reading [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) first.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic\n\nYou need to add permissions for this tool.\n\n```yaml\npermissions:\n  pull-requests: write\n```\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  message: |\n    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>\n```\n\n### Keep more than one comment\n\nIn some cases, different actions may require different comments. The header allows you to maintain comments independently.\n\n````yaml\nrelease:\n  ...\n  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\n    with:\n      header: release\n      message: |\n        Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>\n\ntest:\n  ...\n  - name: Run Test\n    run: |\n      EOF=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=15 count=1 status=none | base64)\n      echo ""test_result<<$EOF"" >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n      rake test >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n      echo ""$EOF"" >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\n    with:\n      header: test\n      message: |\n        ```\n        ${{ env.test_result }}\n        ```\n````\n\n### Append after comment every time it runs\n\n````yaml\ntest:\n  ...\n  - name: Run Test\n    run: |\n      EOF=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=15 count=1 status=none | base64)\n      echo ""test_result<<$EOF"" >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n      rake test >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n      echo ""$EOF"" >> ""$GITHUB_ENV""\n  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\n    with:\n      append: true\n      message: |\n        Test with ${{ github.sha }}.\n        ```\n        ${{ env.test_result }}\n        ```\n````\n\n### Comment from push\n\nIf for some reason, triggering on pr is not possible, you can use push.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: jwalton/gh-find-current-pr@v1\n  id: finder\n- uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\n  with:\n    number: ${{ steps.finder.outputs.pr }}\n    message: |\n      Test ${{ github.sha }} ended successfully.\n      This message is from a push.\n```\n\n### Read comment from a file\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  path: path-to-comment-contents.txt\n```\n\n### Delete the previous comment and add a comment at the end\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  recreate: true\n  message: |\n    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>\n```\n\n### Delete previous comment\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  header: <same-header-as-the-step-that-added-the-comment>\n  delete: true\n```\n\n### Hide the previous comment and add a comment at the end\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  hide_and_recreate: true\n  hide_classify: ""OUTDATED""\n  message: |\n    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>\n```\n\n### Hide previous comment\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  header: <same-header-as-the-step-that-added-the-comment>\n  hide: true\n  hide_classify: ""OUTDATED""\n```\n\n### Error: Resource not accessible by integration\n\nThis tool requires write permission, and that message means the requester does not have enough permission.\nRecently, GitHub sets permissions conservatively for newly created repositories. If it\'s a newly created repository, check your Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions, and make sure to enable read and write permissions.\n\nThen, you can specify permissions for the job like this:\n\n```yaml\npermissions:\n  pull-requests: write\n```\n\nFor more detailed information about permissions, you can read from the link below:\n<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs>\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `header`\n\n**Optional** Header to determine if the comment should be updated (it is not shown to users). It can be used when you want to add multiple comments independently to a given object.\n\n### `append`\n\n**Optional** Indicate if new comment messages should be appended to previous comment message. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.\n\n### `recreate`\n\n**Optional** Indicate if previous comment should be removed before creating a new comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.\n\n### `delete`\n\n**Optional** Delete a previously created comment. Use `header` to point to which comment you want to delete. Only `true` is allowed (i.e. delete this option if you don\'t need it).\n\n### `only_create`\n\n**Optional** Only create a new comment if there is no existing one, otherwise do nothing. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it. This options has higher priority than hide_and_recreate, hide.\n\n### `only_update`\n\n**Optional** Only update a exist comment if there is existing one, otherwise do nothing. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it.\n\n### `hide`\n\n**Optional** Hide a previously created comment. Use `header` to point to which comment you want to delete. Only `true` is allowed (i.e. delete this option if you don\'t need it).\n\n### `hide_classify`\n\n**Optional** The reasons a piece of content can be reported or minimized. SPAM, ABUSE, OFF_TOPIC, OUTDATED, DUPLICATE, RESOLVED are available. default is OUTDATED.\n\n### `hide_details`\n\n**Optional** Hide summary tags in the previously created comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this item when you don\'t need it.\n\n### `hide_and_recreate`\n\n**Optional** Indicate if previous comment should be removed before creating a new comment. Only `true` is allowed. Just skip this option when you don\'t need it.\n\n### `message`\n\n**Optional** Comment message\n\n### `path`\n\n**Optional** Path to file containing comment message\n\n### `number`\n\n**Optional** Pull request number for push event. Note that this has a **lower priority** than the number of a pull_request event.\n\n### `owner`\n\n**Optional** Another repository owner, If not set, the current repository owner is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.\n\n### `repo`\n\n**Optional** Another repository name. Of limited use on GitHub enterprise. If not set, the current repository is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.\n\n### `ignore_empty`\n\n**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, no comment will be posted if the comment body is empty. Note that enabling this will prevent comment hiding & deletion from working when the body is empty.\n\n### `skip_unchanged`\n\n**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, recreating or updating a comment will be skipped if the new message is identical to the current message.\n\n### `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n\n**Optional**, You can set [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) here. If not set, this will use `${{ github.token }}`.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `previous_comment_id`\n\nID of previous comment, if found\n\n### `created_comment_id`\n\nID of newly created comment, if any\n\n## Any problem?\n\nFeel free to report issues. \xf0\x9f\x98\x83\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

[bundled] with the available runners and\n  available in `$CONDA`\n- installing a specific (or latest) version of\n  - [Miniconda3][miniconda-repo]\n  - [Miniforge][miniforge-releases] (or Mambaforge)\n  - any [constructor]-based installer by or URL or filesystem path\n\nA `conda-build-version` or `mamba-version` may be provided to install into\n`base`.\n\nThe base `condabin/` folder is added to `$PATH` and shell integration is\ninitialized across all platforms.\n\nBy default, this action will then create, and _activate_, an environment by one\nof:\n\n- creating a mostly-empty `test` environment, containing only the latest\n  `python-version` and its dependencies\n- creating an `test` environment described in a given `environment-file`:\n  - an `environment.yml`-like file (which can be patched with `python-version`)\n    - the patched environment will be cleaned up unless\n      `clean-patched-environment-file: false` is given\n  - a [lockfile](#example-7-lockfiles)\n\nThis action correctly handles activation of environments and offers the\npossibility of automatically activating the `test` environment on all shells.\n\n> **Please** see the **[IMPORTANT](#important)**

by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_\nactivate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the\n`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the\n`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.\n\n## Inputs and outputs\n\nFor a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see\n[action.yml](action.yml).\n\n### Use a different environment name or path\n\nYou can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path\nby setting the `activate-environment` input option.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    activate-environment: whatever\n```\n\nThis will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is\nthe path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""\nMiniconda installation.\n\n> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will\n>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology. Use this to\n>   avoid ""path too long""-style errors, especially on Windows.\n> - Self-hosted runners can emulate the ""bundled"" Miniconda approach by\n>   pre-installing a [constructor]-based installer and ensuring `$CONDA` is set\n>   prior to starting `setup-miniconda`\n\n### Activate `base` environment\n\nIf your specific workflow still needs to activate and use `base` you will need\nto do **both** of:\n\n- set `activate-environment` to an empty string\n- set `auto-activate-base` to `true`\n\n```yaml\n- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    auto-activate-base: true\n    activate-environment: """"\n```\n\n## Usage examples\n\n### Example 1: Basic usage\n\nThis example shows how to set a basic python workflow with conda using the\ncrossplatform available shells: `bash` and `pwsh`. On this example an\nenvironment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`\ninstalled for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-1:\n    name: Ex1 (${{ matrix.python-version }}, ${{ matrix.os }})\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu-latest"", ""macos-latest"", ""windows-latest""]\n        python-version: [""3.7"", ""2.7""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          auto-update-conda: true\n          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n      - name: Conda info\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: conda info\n      - name: Conda list\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: conda list\n```\n\n### Example 2: Other shells\n\nThis example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating\nsystems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version\navailable and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-2-linux:\n    name: Ex2 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-mac:\n    name: Ex2 Mac\n    runs-on: ""macos-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Sh\n        shell: sh -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-win:\n    name: Ex2 Windows\n    runs-on: ""windows-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell\n        shell: powershell\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Cmd.exe\n        shell: cmd /C CALL {0}\n        run: >-\n          conda info && conda list\n```\n\n### Example 3: Other options\n\nThis example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for\neasier creation of test/build environments and\n[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration\nmanagement. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an\nenvironment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment\nbefore activating the `anaconda-client-env`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-3:\n    name: Ex3 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          python-version: 3.5\n          condarc-file: etc/example-condarc.yml\n          auto-activate-base: false\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n```\n\n### Example 4: Conda options\n\nThis example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The\npriority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will\nresult in:\n\n- conda-forge\n- spyder-ide\n- defaults\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-4:\n    name: Ex4 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: foo\n          python-version: 3.6\n          channels: conda-forge,spyder-ide\n          allow-softlinks: true\n          channel-priority: flexible\n          show-channel-urls: true\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n```\n\n### Example 5: Custom installer\n\nAny installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)\nwhich includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,\n[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of\n[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not\nyet supported by Miniconda.

Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.\n`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires\nyou specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest\npriority.\n\n> Notes:\n>\n> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it\n>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)\n>   with `use-mamba: true`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-6:\n    name: Ex6 Mamba\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.6\n          mamba-version: ""*""\n          channels: conda-forge,defaults\n          channel-priority: true\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n      - shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n          printenv | sort\n      - shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: mamba install jupyterlab\n```\n\n### Example 7: Lockfiles\n\n`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit\nenvironment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution\nstep altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to\nreproduce the environment.\n\nThis means explicitly-defined environments...\n\n- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:\n  - channels are not queried for their repo data\n  - no solver is run\n- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain\n  platform/architecture information\n- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable\n\nThis approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow\nthat runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.\n\n[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock\n[explicit-spec]:\n  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-7:\n    name: Ex7 Explicit\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          auto-update-conda: false\n          activate-environment: explicit-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-explicit.conda.lock\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n          printenv | sort\n```\n\n### Example 10: Miniforge\n\n[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) provides a number of\nalternatives to Miniconda, built from the ground up with `conda-forge` packages\nand with only `conda-forge` in its default channels.\n\nIf only `miniforge-version` is provided, `Miniforge3` will be used.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-10-miniforge:\n    name: Ex10 (${{ matrix.os }}, Miniforge)\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu"", ""macos"", ""windows""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          miniforge-version: latest\n```\n\nIn addition to `Miniforge3` with `conda` and `CPython`, for each of its many\nsupported platforms and architectures, additional variants including\n`Mambaforge` (which comes pre-installed `mamba` in addition to `conda` on all\nplatforms) and `Miniforge-pypy3`/`Mamabaforge-pypy3` (which replace `CPython`\nwith `pypy3` on Linux/MacOS) are available.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-10-mambaforge:\n    name: Ex10 (${{ matrix.os }}, Mambaforge)\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu"", ""macos"", ""windows""]\n        include:\n          - os: ubuntu\n            environment-file: etc/example-environment-no-name.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n            miniforge-version: 4.9.2-4\n          - os: macos\n            environment-file: etc/example-empty-channels-environment.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge-pypy3\n          - os: windows\n            environment-file: etc/example-explicit.Windows.conda.lock\n            condarc-file: etc/example-condarc.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          condarc-file: ${{ matrix.condarc-file }}\n          environment-file: ${{ matrix.environment-file }}\n          miniforge-variant: ${{ matrix.miniforge-variant }}\n          miniforge-version: ${{ matrix.miniforge-version }}\n          use-mamba: true\n```\n\n### Example 11: Alternative Architectures\n\nIn addition to the default 64-bit builds of Miniconda, 32-bit versions are\navailable for Windows. Note that although some x86 builds are available for\nLinux and MacOS, these are too old (<4.6) to be supported by this action.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-11:\n    name:\n      Ex11 (os=${{ matrix.os }} architecture=${{ matrix.architecture }}\n      miniconda-version=${{ matrix.miniconda-version }})\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""windows-latest""]\n        architecture: [""x86""]\n        miniconda-version: [""latest""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: ./\n        with:\n          architecture: ${{ matrix.architecture }}\n          miniconda-version: $${{ matrix.miniconda-version }}\n          auto-update-conda: true\n          python-version: ""3.8""\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n### Caching packages\n\nIf you want to enable package caching for conda you can use the\n[cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) using `~/conda_pkgs_dir` as\npath for conda packages.\n\nThe cache will use a explicit key for restoring and saving the cache.\n\nThis can be based in the contents of files like:\n\n- `setup.py`\n- `requirements.txt`\n- `environment.yml`\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  caching-example:\n    name: Caching\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Cache conda\n        uses: actions/cache@v2\n        env:\n          # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n          CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n        with:\n          path: ~/conda_pkgs_dir\n          key:\n            ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}-${{\n            hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment.yml\') }}\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          channel-priority: strict\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true # IMPORTANT: This needs to be set for caching to work properly!\n```\n\nIf you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then\nyou may want to\n[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),\nas they are not included in the conda package cache.\n\n### Caching environments\n\nThe first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without specifying\na environment file.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup Mambaforge\n  uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n    miniforge-version: latest\n    activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n    use-mamba: true\n```\n\nIt\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies of\npackage versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. Here we ensure\nthat this happens by adding the current date to the cache key. You can remove\nthe ""Get Date"" step below if you use a resolved environment file product of\n`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Get Date\n  id: get-date\n  run: echo ""today=$(/bin/date -u \'+%Y%m%d\')"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n  shell: bash\n\n- name: Cache Conda env\n  uses: actions/cache@v2\n  with:\n    path: ${{ env.CONDA }}/envs\n    key:\n      conda-${{ runner.os }}--${{ runner.arch }}--${{\n      steps.get-date.outputs.today }}-${{\n      hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment-caching.yml\') }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER\n      }}\n  env:\n    # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n    CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n  id: cache\n```\n\nKeep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the same\nas hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves the\ndependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages available on\nthe channels at installation time. Since packages are updated all the time, you\nwill not see these changes reflected in the cache until the key gets updated by\ndate.\n\n**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally but\nfail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache manually to\nsee if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved environment file.**\n\nFinally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache does\nnot exist.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Update environment\n  run:\n    mamba env update -n anaconda-client-env -f\n    etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n  if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n```\n\n### Use a default shell\n\nAssuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -el {0}` to\nevery single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all\nthe steps.\n\nBy adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -el {0}`, all steps in\nthe job will default to that value.\n\nFor other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default\nvalue. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.\n\nMore information the\n[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  default-shell:\n    name: Default shell\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n      - run: conda info\n      - run: conda list\n      - run: conda config --show\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\n- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -el {0}` on steps that need to be\n  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are\n  executed with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated\n  on bash profile files made by `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)\n  and\n  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).\n- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly\n  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed\n  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by\n  `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be\n  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are\n  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag\n  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which\n  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`\n  option to `true`.\n- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda\n  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a\n  version of conda compatible with the option.\n- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the\n  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide\n  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was\n  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts\n  and result in very long install times.\n- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`. Please use `bash`.\n\n## Project History and Contributing\n\nSee the\n[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\nfor project history, or\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto get started adding features you need.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to all the contributors that make this awesome project possible!\n\n[![Meet our contributors!](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=conda-incubator/setup-miniconda)](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda/graphs/contributors)\n\n_Made with [contributors-img](https://contrib.rocks)._\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the\n[MIT License](LICENSE.txt)\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

It will download test results and create reports\n\nThe second workflow will only run after it has been merged into your default branch (typically `main` or `master`), it won\'t run in a PR unless after the workflow file is part of that branch.\n\n**PR head branch:**  *.github/workflows/ci.yml*\n```yaml\nname: \'CI\'\non:\n  pull_request:\njobs:\n  build-test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2         # checkout the repo\n      - run: npm ci                       # install packages\n      - run: npm test                     # run tests (configured to use jest-junit reporter)\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2  # upload test results\n        if: success() || failure()        # run this step even if previous step failed\n        with:\n          name: test-results\n          path: jest-junit.xml\n```\n**default branch:**  *.github/workflows/test-report.yml*\n```yaml\nname: \'Test Report\'\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']                     # runs after CI workflow\n    types:\n      - completed\njobs:\n  report:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1\n      with:\n        artifact: test-results            # artifact name\n        name: JEST Tests                  # Name of the check run which will be created\n        path: \'*.xml\'                     # Path to test results (inside artifact .zip)\n        reporter: jest-junit              # Format of test results\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\n- uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1\n  with:\n\n    # Name or regex of artifact containing test results\n    # Regular expression must be enclosed in \'/\'.\n    # Values from captured groups will replace occurrences of $N in report name.\n    # Example:\n    #   artifact: /test-results-(.*)/\n    #   name: \'Test report $1\'\n    #   -> Artifact \'test-result-ubuntu\' would create report \'Test report ubuntu\'\n    artifact: \'\'\n\n    # Name of the Check Run which will be created\n    name: \'\'\n\n    # Coma separated list of paths to test results\n    # Supports wildcards via [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob)\n    # All matched result files must be of the same format\n    path: \'\'\n\n    # The fast-glob library that is internally used interprets backslashes as escape characters.\n    # If enabled, all backslashes in provided path will be replaced by forward slashes and act as directory separators.\n    # It might be useful when path input variable is composed dynamically from existing directory paths on Windows.\n    path-replace-backslashes: \'false\'\n\n    # Format of test results.

No custom styling or HTML is possible.\n- Maximum report size is 65535 bytes. Input parameters `list-suites` and `list-tests` will be automatically adjusted if max size is exceeded.\n- Test report can\'t reference any additional files (e.g. screenshots). You can use `actions/upload-artifact@v2` to upload them and inspect them manually.\n- Check Runs are created for specific commit SHA. It\'s not possible to specify under which workflow test report should belong if more\n  workflows are running for the same SHA. Thanks to this GitHub ""feature"" it\'s possible your test report will appear in an unexpected place in GitHub UI.\n  For more information, see [#67](https://github.com/dorny/test-reporter/issues/67).\n\n## See also\n- [paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) - Conditionally run actions based on files modified by PR, feature branch, or pushed commits\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/dorny/test-reporter/blob/main/LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
659,"b'# cosign-installer GitHub Action\n\nThis action enables you to sign and verify container images using `cosign`.\n`cosign-installer` verifies the integrity of the `cosign` release during installation.\n\nFor a quick start guide on the usage of `cosign`, please refer to https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start.\nFor available `cosign` releases, see https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis action currently supports GitHub-provided Linux, macOS and Windows runners (self-hosted runners may not work).\n\nAdd the following entry to your Github workflow YAML file:\n\n```yaml\nuses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1\nwith:\n  cosign-release: \'v2.1.1\' # optional\n```\n\nExample using a pinned version:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions: {}\n\n    name: Install Cosign\n    steps:\n      - name: Install Cosign\n        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1\n        with:\n          cosign-release: \'v2.1.1\'\n      - name: Check install!\n        run: cosign version\n```\n\nExample using the default version:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions: {}\n\n    name: Install Cosign\n    steps:\n      - name: Install Cosign\n        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1\n      - name: Check install!\n        run: cosign version\n```\n\nIf you want to install cosign from its main version by using \'go install\' under the hood, you can set \'cosign-release\' as \'main\'. Once you did that, cosign will be installed via \'go install\' which means that please ensure that go is installed.\n\nExample of installing cosign via go install:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions: {}\n\n    name: Install Cosign via go install\n    steps:\n      - name: Install go\n        uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n        with:\n          go-version: \'1.20\'\n          check-latest: true\n      - name: Install Cosign\n        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1\n        with:\n          cosign-release: main\n      - name: Check install!\n        run: cosign version\n```\n\nThis action does not need any GitHub permission to run, however, if your workflow needs to update, create or perform any\naction against your repository, then you should change the scope of the permission appropriately.\n\nFor example, if you are using the `gcr.io` as your registry to push the images you will need to give the `write` permission\nto the `packages` scope.\n\nExample of a simple workflow:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build-image:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      packages: write\n      id-token: write # needed for signing the images with GitHub OIDC Token\n\n    name: build-image\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3.5.2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 1\n\n      - name: Install Cosign\n        uses: sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.1.1\n\n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2.1.0\n\n      - name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2.5.0\n\n      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2.1.0\n        with:\n          registry: ghcr.io\n          username: ${{ github.actor }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - id: docker_meta\n        uses: docker/metadata-action@v4.4.0\n        with:\n          images: ghcr.io/sigstore/sample-honk\n          tags: type=sha,format=long\n\n      - name: Build and Push container images\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4.0.0\n        id: build-and-push\n        with:\n          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64\n          push: true\n          tags: ${{ steps.docker_meta.outputs.tags }}\n\n      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-an-intermediate-environment-variable\n      - name: Sign image with a key\n        run: |\n          cosign sign --yes --key env://COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY ""${TAGS}@${DIGEST}""\n        env:\n          TAGS: ${{ steps.docker_meta.outputs.tags }}\n          COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n          COSIGN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.COSIGN_PASSWORD }}\n          DIGEST: ${{ steps.build-and-push.outputs.digest }}\n\n      - name: Sign the images with GitHub OIDC Token\n        env:\n          DIGEST: ${{ steps.build-and-push.outputs.digest }}\n          TAGS: ${{ steps.docker_meta.outputs.tags }}\n        run: cosign sign --yes ""${TAGS}@${DIGEST}""\n```\n\n### Optional Inputs\nThe following optional inputs:\n\n| Input | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cosign-release` | `cosign` version to use instead of the default. |\n| `install-dir` | directory to place the `cosign` binary into instead of the default (`$HOME/.cosign`). |\n| `use-sudo` | set to `true` if `install-dir` location requires sudo privs. Defaults to false. |\n\n## Security\n\nShould you discover any security issues, please refer to Sigstore\'s [security\nprocess](https://github.com/sigstore/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

study](https://infosecwriteups.com/detecting-malware-packages-in-github-actions-7b93a9985635) on how Harden-Runner detected malicious packages in the NPM registry.\n\n## How\n\n1. Add `step-security/harden-runner` to your GitHub Actions workflow file as the first step in each job.\n\n   ```yaml\n   steps:\n     - uses: step-security/harden-runner@8ca2b8b2ece13480cda6dacd3511b49857a23c09 # v2.5.1\n       with:\n         egress-policy: audit\n   ```\n\n2. In the workflow logs and the job markdown summary, you will see a link to security insights and recommendations.\n\n    <p align=""left"">\n      <img src=""images/buildlog1.png"" alt=""Link in build log"" >\n    </p>\n\n3. Click on the link ([example link](https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/microsoft/msquic/actions/runs/5577342236)). You will see a process monitor view of network and file events correlated with each step of the job.\n\n    <p align=""left"">\n      <img src=""images/Insights4.png"" alt=""Insights from harden-runner"" >\n    </p>\n\n4. Under the insights section, you\'ll find a Recommended Policy. You can either update your workflow file with this Policy, or alternatively, use the [Policy Store](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/how-tos/block-egress-traffic#2-add-the-policy-using-the-policy-store) to apply the policy without modifying the workflow file.\n\n    <p align=""left"">\n      <img src=""images/rec-policy1.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >\n    </p>\n\n## Support for ARC and Private Repositories\n\nActions Runner Controller (ARC) and Private repositories are supported with a commercial license. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/stepsecurity-platform/billing) for more details.\n\nInstall the [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) to use Harden-Runner GitHub Action for `Private` repositories.\n\n- If you use Harden-Runner GitHub Action in a private repository, the generated insights URL is NOT public.\n- You need to authenticate first to access insights URL for private repository. Only those who have access to the repository can view it.\n- [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) only needs `actions: read` permissions on your repositories.\n\nRead this [case study on how Kapiche uses Harden-Runner](https://www.stepsecurity.io/case-studies/kapiche/) to improve software supply chain security in their private repositories.\n\n## Features at a glance\n\nFor details, check out the documentation at https://docs.stepsecurity.io\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa6 Restrict egress traffic to allowed endpoints\n\nOnce allowed endpoints are set in the policy in the workflow file, or in the [Policy Store](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/how-tos/block-egress-traffic#2-add-the-policy-using-the-policy-store)\n\n- Harden-Runner blocks egress traffic at the DNS (Layer 7) and network layers (Layers 3 and 4).\n- It blocks DNS exfiltration, where attacker tries to send data out using DNS resolution\n- Blocks outbound traffic using IP tables\n- Wildcard domains are supported, e.g. you can add `*.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443` to the allowed list, and egress traffic will be allowed to `eastus.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443` and `westus.data.mcr.microsoft.com:443`.\n\n<p align=""left"">\n  <img src=""images/block-outbound-call.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >\n</p>\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x95\xb5\xef\xb8\x8f Detect tampering of source code during build\n\nHarden-Runner monitors file writes and can detect if a file is overwritten.\n\n- Source code overwrite is not expected in a release build\n- All source code files are monitored, which means even changes to IaC files (Kubernetes manifest, Terraform) are detected\n- You can enable notifications to get one-time alert when source code is overwritten\n\n<p align=""left"">\n  <img src=""images/fileoverwrite.png"" alt=""Policy recommended by harden-runner"" >\n</p>\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x9a\xab Run your job without sudo access\n\nGitHub-hosted runner uses passwordless sudo for running jobs.\n\n- This means compromised build tools or dependencies can install attack tools\n- If your job does not need sudo access, you see a policy\n  recommendation to disable sudo in the insights page\n- When you set `disable-sudo` to `true`, the job steps run without sudo access to the Ubuntu VM\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x94\x94 Get security alerts\n\nInstall the [StepSecurity Actions Security GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security) to get security alerts.\n\n- Email and Slack notifications are supported\n- Notifications are sent when outbound traffic is blocked or source code is overwritten\n- Notifications are not repeated for the same alert for a given workflow\n\n## Discussions\n\nIf you have questions or ideas, please use [discussions](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/discussions). For support for ARC and Private repositories, email info@stepsecurity.io.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nFor GitHub-hosted runners, Harden-Runner GitHub Action downloads and installs the StepSecurity Agent.\n\n- The code to monitor file, process, and network activity is in the Agent.\n- The agent is written in Go and is open source at https://github.com/step-security/agent\n- The agent\'s build is reproducible. You can view the steps to reproduce the build [here](http://app.stepsecurity.io/github/step-security/agent/releases/latest)\n\n## Limitations for GitHub-Hosted Runners\n\n1. Only Ubuntu VM is supported. Windows and MacOS GitHub-hosted runners are not supported. There is a discussion about that [here](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/discussions/121).\n2. Harden-Runner is not supported when [job is run in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) as it needs sudo access on the Ubuntu VM to run. It can be used to monitor jobs that use containers to run steps. The limitation is if the entire job is run in a container. That is not common for GitHub Actions workflows, as most of them run directly on `ubuntu-latest`.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

To migrate, make the following updates:\n\n- The `type` output is now an empty string instead of `\'none\'` when no release occurs\n  ```diff\n    - run: echo ""Version changed!""\n  -   if: ${{ steps.publish.outputs.type != \'none\' }}\n  +   if: ${{ steps.publish.outputs.type }}\n  ```\n- The `--ignore-scripts` option is now passed to `npm publish` as a security precaution. If you define any publish lifecycle scripts - `prepublishOnly`, `prepack`, `prepare`, `postpack`, `publish`, `postpublish` - run them explicitly or set the `ignore-scripts` input to `false`.\n  ```diff\n    with:\n      token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n  +   ignore-scripts: false\n  ```\n- The workflow\'s `.npmrc` file is no longer modified. If you have any workarounds to adjust for this misbehavior - for example, if you\'re using `actions/setup-node` to configure `.npmrc` - you should remove them.\n\n  ```diff\n    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      with:\n        node-version: \'18\'\n        registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/\n\n    - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v1\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n\n    - name: Do some more stuff with npm\n      run: npm whoami\n      env:\n  -     INPUT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n  +     NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n  ```\n\n- The `check-version` and `greater-version-only` options have been removed and replaced with `strategy`.\n  - Use `strategy: all` (default) to publish all versions that do not yet exist in the registry.\n    ```diff\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n    -   check-version: true\n    -   greater-version-only: false\n    +   strategy: all\n    ```\n  - Use `strategy: upgrade` to only publish versions that upgrade the selected tag.\n    ```diff\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n    -   check-version: true\n    -   greater-version-only: true\n    +   strategy: upgrade\n    ```\n  - `check-version: false` has been removed. You may not need this action if you\'re not checking already published versions; [you can `npm` directly][publishing-nodejs-packages], instead.\n    ```diff\n    - - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v1\n    -   with:\n    -     token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n    -     check-version: false\n    + - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n    +   with:\n    +     node-version: \'18\'\n    +     registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/\n    + - run: npm publish\n    +   env:\n    +     NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n    ```\n\nSee the [change log][] for more details and other changes in the v2 release.\n\n[publishing-nodejs-packages]: https://docs.github.com/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages\n[change log]: https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/releases\n\n## GitHub Action\n\nTo use the GitHub Action, you\'ll need to add it as a step in your [workflow file][]. By default, the only thing you need to do is set the `token` parameter to your [npm authentication token][].\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ""18""\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n      - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nYou can also publish to third-party registries. For example, to publish to the [GitHub Package Registry][], set `token` to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` and `registry` to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      packages: write # allow GITHUB_TOKEN to publish packages\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ""18""\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n      - uses: JS-DevTools/npm-publish@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          registry: ""https://npm.pkg.github.com""\n```\n\n[workflow file]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions\n[npm authentication token]: https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens\n[GitHub Package Registry]: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry\n\n### Usage\n\nYou can set any or all of the following input parameters using `with`:\n\n| Name             | Type                   | Default                       | Description                                                                      |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `token`          | string                 | **required**                  | Authentication token to use with the configured registry.                        |\n| `registry`\xc2\xb9      | string                 | `https://registry.npmjs.org/` | Registry URL to use.                                                             |\n| `package`        | string                 | Current working directory     | Path to a package directory, a `package.json`, or a packed `.tgz` to publish.    |\n| `tag`\xc2\xb9           | string                 | `latest`                      | [Distribution tag][npm-tag] to publish to.                                       |\n| `access`\xc2\xb9        | `public`, `restricted` | [npm defaults][npm-access]    | Whether the package should be publicly visible or restricted.                    |\n| `provenance`\xc2\xb9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb2  | boolean                | `false`                       | Run `npm publish` with the `--provenance` flag to add [provenance][] statements. |\n| `strategy`       | `all`, `upgrade`       | `all`                         | Use `all` to publish all unique versions, `upgrade` for only semver upgrades.    |\n| `ignore-scripts` | boolean                | `true`                        | Run `npm publish` with the `--ignore-scripts` flag as a security precaution.     |\n| `dry-run`        | boolean                | `false`                       | Run `npm publish` with the `--dry-run` flag to prevent publication.              |\n\n1.

If omited no link is shown.\n  \n  ### Outputs\n  None.\n\n  ## Example\n  ```yml\nname: ""test""\non: # run on any PRs and main branch changes\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\n  jobs:\n  test: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Run the action # You would run your tests before this using the output to set state/desc\n      uses: Sibz/github-status-action@v1\n      with: \n        authToken: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n        context: \'Test run\'\n        description: \'Passed\'\n        state: \'success\'\n        sha: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha}}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
664,"b""# Setup cmake for GitHub Actions\n\nGithub action to setup the cmake build script generator.\n\nThis action will update the path for your workflow to include cmake\nmatching the platform and version requirements.\n\n### Usage\n\nAdding a step that uses this action to your workflow will setup cmake\nand make it available to subsequent steps:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Setup cmake\n      uses: jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake@v1.13\n      with:\n        cmake-version: '3.16.x'\n    - name: Use cmake\n      run: cmake --version\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThere are three options for the action:\n\n* `cmake-version` controls the version of CMake that is added to the path. This\n  can be a fully specified verison `3.3.0`, partly specified `3.2`, a wildcard\n  version `3.2.x`. By default it is empty which will give the latest CMake\n  version available on GitHub.\n\n  The version can also be specified to be `latest` which is equivalent to\n  leaving it blank and will give the latest version.\n\n  The [version tests] show some expected values for given versions.\n\n* `github-api-token` is optional, but is used to authenticate with GitHub's\n  API. By default it will use the token generated by the workflow. If set to\n  blank then no authentication is used to access the API and there is a chance\n  that the test runner will have hit the API rate limit causing the action to\n  fail to download the available versions from GitHub.\n\n  See also:\n   - [GitHub API rate limiting]\n   - [GITHUB_TOKEN]\n\n* `use-32bit` forces the use of a 32 bit binary, instead of first looking for a\n  64 bit binary. Note that more recent releases of cmake only have 32 bit\n  packages for windows and not for linux or macos, so this option may cause\n  failures in those cases.\n\n  Possible values are `true` or `false`. The default is `false`.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe action will download the list of releases of CMake available on GitHub and\nchoose the best match for the test runner's platform and the version\nrequirements given as as option. The CMake package is then either downloaded\nfrom GitHub, or a cached version from the action's tool cache is used, and the\nexecutables are provided on the path for subsequent workflow steps.\n\n\n[version tests]: ./__tests__/version.test.ts\n[GitHub API rate limiting]: https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting\n[GITHUB_TOKEN]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret\n\n\n""","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Therefore, the @v1 tag of this action will stop working on October 1, 2022. You can switch to the @v2 tag at any time (by updating the reference in your workflow file).\n\n## Project board\n\nSince the issues and pull requests from this repository are also managed by this automation, you can take an example from the public project board to see what it looks like.\n\n[Project board](https://github.com/users/leonsteinhaeuser/projects/6).\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable                 | Required | Description |\n| ------------------------ | -------- |------------ |\n| `gh_token`               | false    | The GitHub token to use for the automation. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |\n| `gh_app_ID`              | false    | The GitHub App ID used for App authentication. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |\n| `gh_app_installation_ID` | false    | The Github App installation ID binding the App to the target org. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |\n| `gh_app_secret_key`      | false    | The Github App Secret key used to sign App JWT tokens. For App instructions refer to [GH App Auth](#GH-App-Auth). (`gh_token` or `gh_app_*` must be defined) |\n| `user`                   | false    | The GitHub username that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |\n| `organization`           | false    | The GitHub organization that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |\n| `project_id`             | true     | The projectboard id. |\n| `resource_node_id`       | true     | The id of the resource node. |\n| `status_value`           | false    | The status value to set. Must be one of the values defined in your project board **Status field settings**. If left unspecified, new items are added without an explicit status, and existing items are left alone. |\n| `operation_mode`         | false    | The operation mode to use. Must be one of `custom_field`, `status`. Defaults to: `status` |\n| `custom_field_values`    | false    | Provides the possibility to change custom fields. To be applied the **operation_mode** must be set to `custom_field`. For the json definition refer to [JSON-Definition](#JSON-Definition) |\n| `move_related_issues` | false | If set to `true` and the operation mode is set to `status`, the automation will also move related issues to the same column. This is useful if you want to move an issue to the same column as its related pull request. Defaults to: `false` |\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe following example assumes that you have a project board with the following columns:\n\n- **Todo**\n- **In Progress**\n- **Done**\n\nBefore we start to automate the project board, we need to decide whether we want to manage the **Status** field using this action or the workflow definition of the project board. Keep in mind that until now there is no way to automatically add issues or pull requests to the project board using the provided workflow functionality by GitHub. The next example assumes that you decided to use this action to manage the **Status** field.\n\n| Current Status | Target Status   | Event name  | GitHub event  | Description |\n| -------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| **any**        | **Todo**        | issues | `github.event.action == \'opened\'`, `github.event.action == \'reopened\'` | Define an automation that moves an issue to the *Todo* column. |\n| **any**        | **In Progress** | pull_request    | `github.event.action == \'opened\'`, `github.event.action == \'reopened\'`, `github.event.action == \'review_requested\'` | Define an automation that moves a pull request to the *In Progress* column. |\n| **any**        | **Closed**      | issues, pull_request | `github.event.action == \'closed\'` | Define an automation that moves an issue or pull request to the *Done* column. |\n\nThe resulting workflow file is defined as follows:\n\n```yaml\nname: Project automations\non:\n  issues:\n    types:\n      -

Although the workflow runs in the context of the base of the pull request, you should make sure that you do not check out, build, or run untrusted code from the pull request with this event. Additionally, any caches share the same scope as the base branch. To help prevent cache poisoning, you should not save the cache if there is a possibility that the cache contents were altered.\n\n## GH App Auth\n\nTo leverage the App authentication with this action the following steps are needed:\n\n- Create a GitHub App under your user or organisation as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app), note the App ID\n- Set the needed GitHub App permissions in order for the newly create App to access and manage Org Project, as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/editing-a-github-apps-permissions).

By default, the action will look for a file in your `.github/workflows/` folder named `matrix_includes.json`. If you want to name the file differently, or place it in a different folder, set the path via the `inputFile` input.\n\nIf you need to define the entire `strategy.matrix` value, you will need to set `addInclude` to `false`. Please note that you must then ensure your **input file** and **JSON query** provide the results your workflow needs.\n\n#### Sample JSON File\n\nThe following is the sample file (`matrix_includes.json`) that was used in the workflow above.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        ""runs_on"":""ubuntu-latest"",        \n        ""runOnBranch"":""always""\n    },\n    {\n        ""runs_on"":""windows-latest"",        \n        ""runOnBranch"":""main""\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### JSON File Placement\n\nFor a cleaner repository, I recommend placing the `matrix_includes.json` file in your `.github/workflows/` folder. Doing so will also help communicate the purpose of the file. You do not have to follow this advice, of course, as this Action allows the location of the file to be passed via the `inputFile` input.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis Action requires an output to be passed between jobs.

The jacoco-badge-generator parses a `jacoco.csv` \nfrom a JaCoCo coverage report, computes coverage percentages \nfrom [JaCoCo\'s Instructions and Branches counters](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html), and \ngenerates badges for one or both of these (user configurable) to provide an easy \nto read visual summary of the code coverage of your test cases. The default behavior directly\ngenerates the badges internally with no external calls, but the action also provides an option\nto instead generate [Shields JSON endpoints](#direct-badge-generation-vs-json-endpoint). It supports\nboth the basic case of a single `jacoco.csv`, as well as multi-module projects in which\ncase the action can produce coverage badges from the combination of the JaCoCo reports\nfrom all modules, provided that the individual reports are independent. It can also be configured to \ngenerate a simple JSON file containing the coverages as double-precision floating-point values, either \ninstead of or in addition to generating the badges, which may be useful as input to other tools.\n\nWhen used as a GitHub Action, the jacoco-badge-generator can also optionally be used as part of a pull-request \ncheck. Specifically, you can configure it to fail the workflow run if coverage decreased relative to prior run, \nand/or if coverage is below a target threshold. See the [Inputs](#inputs) section for details of how to configure \nit for this purpose. \n\n_The developers of the jacoco-badge-generator are not affiliated with the developers of JaCoCo, although we are a \nfan and user of their excellent test coverage tool._ \n\n## Table of Contents\n\nThe documentation is organized into the following sections:\n* [The Coverage Metrics](#the-coverage-metrics): Explains the JaCoCo \n  metrics that are supported by the badge generator, such as what \n  they measure, and why they were chosen for inclusion for \n  the jacoco-badge-generator.\n* [Badge Style and Content](#badge-style-and-content): Provides \n  examples of the appearance of the badges that are generated, \n  including a description of the color scheme used, and the \n  formatting of the percentages.\n* [GitHub Action Usage](#github-action-usage): Details on how to use the \n  jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action (its primary use-case).\n  * [Inputs](#inputs): Detailed descriptions of the action inputs.\n  * [Outputs](#outputs): Detailed descriptions of the action inputs.\n  * [Example Workflows](#example-workflows): Example GitHub workflows \n    demonstrating usage of the jacoco-badge-generator action.\n  * [Multi-Module Example Workflows](#multi-module-example-workflows): Example \n    GitHub workflows demonstrating usage of the jacoco-badge-generator \n    action with multi-module projects.\n  * [Examples in Other Projects](#examples-in-other-projects): Info and a link\n    to a template repository that we have setup to provide live runnable workflows\n    to get you started; as well as links to a few repositories that are actively\n    using the action, as well as direct links to the relevant workflow files.\n* [Command-Line Usage](#command-line-usage): Details on how to install and run\n  the jacoco-badge-generator as a command-line utility outside of GitHub Actions.\n  * [Installing from PyPI](#installing-from-pypi): How to install command-line\n    utility from PyPI.\n  * [Running for the First Time](#running-for-the-first-time): Command-line utility\'s\n    help menu.\n  * [CLI Examples](#cli-examples): Several examples of using the command-line utlity.\n* [Summary of Input Defaults](#summary-of-input-defaults): A table summarizing all\n  of the inputs, along with the defaults, for both GitHub Actions usage as well as\n  CLI usage.\n* [Blog Posts](#blog-posts): A selection of blog posts about the GitHub Action.\n* [Support the Project](#support-the-project): Information on various \n  ways that you can support the project.\n\n\n## The Coverage Metrics\n\nThe jacoco-badge-generator currently supports generating badges for \nthe two primary coverage metrics generated by JaCoCo: Instructions (C0 Coverage), and \nBranches (C1 Coverage). Here is a summary of what these compute and why they were chosen\nfor inclusion by this badge generator.\n\n### Instructions Coverage (C0 Coverage)\n\nThe default behavior of the badge generator is to generate only the Instructions Coverage\nbadge, which is labeled on the badge simply as ""coverage"". JaCoCo \nmeasures [C0 Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)\nfrom the Java bytecode instructions in the compiled `.class` files. One of the advantages\nto counting the bytecode instructions executed or missed, rather than lines of source code, \nis that it is independent of coding style and formatting. As a simple example, consider\nthe sequence of Java statements to swap the values in two \nvariables: `int temp = a; a = b; b = temp;`.  A line counter will count this as 1 line if\nwritten on a single line, or 3 lines if each statement is written on its own line. However,\nJaCoCo\'s instructions counter treats these two cases as equivalent since they compile\nto the same bytecode. Consider a more complex example of calling a method while passing a simple\nvalue, such as `foo(5)` versus passing the result of a calculation to the method, such as\n`foo(2.0 + bar/11.0)`. Line counting considers both of these as 1 line; while the second case\nwill factor in more heavily into JaCoCo\'s instruction counting than will the first case. For\nthese reasons, although JaCoCo also provides line coverage data, we do not currently support\ngenerating a badge from JaCoCo\'s line counter data. JaCoCo\'s use of bytecode instructions\nin its definition of C0 Coverage is a more meaningful measure of coverage than is counting\nlines of code.\n\n### Branches Coverage (C1 Coverage)\n\nThe badge generator also optionally supports generating a badge for Branches Coverage\n(or C1 Coverage), with the generated badge labeled as ""branches"".  See \nthe [inputs](#inputs) section for a description of the action\ninputs.  JaCoCo \nmeasures [C1 Coverage or Branches Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)\nfrom the Java bytecode in the compiled `.class` files, so the result may be a bit\ndifferent than what you might expect from branch coverage. At first, you may even mistakenly\nguess that it is counting conditions (C2 coverage) rather than branches, but it is counting\nbranches (in bytecode rather than in source code). Consider this example to illustrate\nthe difference: `if (a && b) foo(); else bar();`. If we count branches in source code,\nthere are 2 branches, which would require a minimum of two tests for full coverage, one where\nboth `a` and `b` are `true`, and a second test where at least one of them is `false`.\nIf we instead count conditions, there are 4 conditions (`a==true`, `a==false`, `b==true`, \n`b==false`), which can be covered with as few as two tests (e.g., `a==true` and `b==false`\nas test one, and `b==true` and `a==false` as test two), without actually covering both\nbranches. JaCoCo\'s branches counter is neither of these. JaCoCo\'s branches counter\ncounts branches in the Java bytecode. What does that mean for this example? Imagine instead\nthat the if statement above was written as a pair of nested if \nstatements: `if (a) { if (b) { foo(); } else { bar(); } } else { bar(); }`. There are\na total of 4 branches in this case (and is essentially what JaCoCo would count as branches).\nTo cover all 4 branches would require a minimum of 3 test cases: one where `a` and `b` are both\n`true`, one in which `a` is `true` and `b` is `false`, and a third where `a` is `false` and `b`\'s \nvalue doesn\'t matter. In this way, JaCoCo\'s branches counter leads to a stronger form\nof C1 Coverage than is usually implied by branches coverage.\n\n\n## Badge Style and Content\n\n### Default Color Scheme\n\nHere are a few samples of what the badges look like if you use\nthe default colors:\n\n| Coverage range | Direct badge generation | Badge generation from endpoint |\n| :---  | :--- | :--- | \n| Bright green for 100% coverage  | ![Coverage 100%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/100.svg) | ![Coverage 100%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/100.json) |\n| Green for 90% through 99.9% coverage | ![Coverage 99.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999.svg) | ![Coverage 99.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999.json) |\n| Yellow green for 80% through 89.9% coverage | ![Coverage 80%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/80.svg) | ![Coverage 80%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/80.json) |\n| Yellow for 70% through 79.9% coverage | ![Coverage 70%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/70.svg) | ![Coverage 70%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/70.json) |\n| Orange for 60% through 69.9% coverage | ![Coverage 60%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/60.svg) | ![Coverage 60%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/60.json) |\n| Red for 0% through 59.9% coverage | ![Coverage 59.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/599.svg) | ![Coverage 59.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/599.json) |\n| Sample of a branch coverage badge | ![Branches Coverage 99.9%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999b.svg) | ![Branches Coverage 99.9%](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/main/tests/999b.json) |\n\n### Customizing Colors or Coverage Intervals\n\nThe jacoco-badge-generator provides two inputs that can be used to customize \nthe colors used for the badges. The `colors` input enables you to pass a list \nof colors to the action. The `intervals` input enables you to pass a list of \npercentages used to determine color choice. If you like the default colors, \nbut want to start the colors at different percentages, then you can use the \n`intervals` input to accomplish that. These two inputs can be used either\nindividually or in combination depending upon what you want to do. See the\n[Inputs](#inputs) section for more details.\n\n### Displayed Percentages\n\nThe coverage displayed in the badge is the result of truncating to one \ndecimal place.  If that decimal place is 0, then it is displayed as an \ninteger.  The rationale for truncating to one decimal place, rather than \nrounding is to avoid displaying a just failing coverage as passing. For\nexample, if the user of the action considers 80% to be a passing level,\nthen we wish to avoid the case of 79.9999% being rounded to 80% (it will\ninstead be truncated to 79.9%). \n\n### Direct Badge Generation vs JSON Endpoint\n\nThe default behavior generates badges that are inspired by the style of the badges \nof [Shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields), and generates the badges entirely\nwithin the jacoco-badge-generator, with no external calls. However, it also supports \nan optional alternative to instead generate [Shields JSON endpoints](https://shields.io/endpoint). \nMost users will likely prefer the default behavior, for a variety of reasons, such as \nsimpler insertion of badge into README and probable faster loading. The main reason to \nconsider generating a JSON endpoint instead is if you are trying to match the style of \nthe coverage badges to other badges in your README that use one of Shields\'s alternative \nstyles. The default internally generated badges match the default Shields style. See \nthe [Inputs](#inputs) section for more details on how to generate JSON endpoints instead \nof badges.\n\n### Adding the Badges to your README\n\n#### If you generate the badges (default behavior)....\n\nIf you use the default badges directory and default badge filenames, then \nyou can add the coverage badge to your repository\'s readme with the following \nmarkdown: \n```markdown\n![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)\n```\n\nAnd likewise for the branch coverage badge: \n```markdown\n![Branches](.github/badges/branches.svg)\n```\n\nSee the [Inputs](#inputs) section for how to change the directory and filenames of\nthe badges. You can of course also link these to the JaCoCo coverage report if you host it\nonline, or perhaps to the workflow that generated it, such as with (just replace \nUSERNAME and REPOSITORY with yours):\n```markdown\n[![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n```\nThe above assumes that the relevant workflow is `build.yml` (replace as needed). This will\nlink the badge to the runs of that specific workflow.\n\n#### If you generate JSON endpoints instead....\n\nInserting coverage badges into your README is more complex if you use\nthe alternate behavior of generating JSON endpoints. It involves\npassing the URL of your coverage endpoint to Shields custom badge endpoint.\nAssuming that you use the default badge directory, you would then use\nthe following markdown:\n```markdown\n![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/BRANCHNAME/.github/badges/jacoco.json)\n```\nIn the above, replace USERNAME, REPOSITORY, and BRANCHNAME with yours. You can do\nsomething similar for the branches coverage badge, such as:\n```markdown\n![Branches](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/BRANCHNAME/.github/badges/branches.json)\n```\nAnd of course, you can also link these to your workflow runs just as before with:\n```markdown\n[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/BRANCHNAME/.github/badges/jacoco.json)](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n```\n\nIf you do have reason to prefer generating endpoints over generating the badges directly,\nthen you might consider pushing the endpoints to a GitHub Pages site instead, such\nas a project site served from a docs directory of your default branch, or from a gh-pages\nbranch. To do so, in addition to configuring GitHub Pages, you would need to use the\n`badges-directory` input to change the directory where the endpoints are stored\n(e.g., in ""docs"" or in a subdirectory of ""docs""). Doing so would probably speed up Shields\'s\naccess to your JSON endpoint, since you\'d gain the benefit of the CDN that backs GitHub\nPages; whereas passing Shields the URL to the JSON file on GitHub\'s raw server will probably\nbe slower. Note that the potential benefit is probably small, so if doing so would complicate\nyour workflow, you can simply pass the URL of the endpoint from GitHub\'s raw server\n(e.g., the examples of generating badges from an endpoint in the rightmost column\nof the table in section [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme) were done that way,\nwithout the use of GitHub Pages).\n\nThis is not an issue if you use the default behavior of directly generating the badge,\nsince in that case the image is served directly to the viewer from the repository whose \nREADME is being viewed.\n\n\n## GitHub Action Usage\n\nThe jacoco-badge-generator\'s primary use-case is as a GitHub Action. The subsections of this\nsection documents how to use it as a GitHub Action.\n\n### Inputs\n\nAll inputs include default values, and are thus optional provided the\ndefaults are relevant to your use-case.\n\n#### `jacoco-csv-file`\n\nThis input is the full path, relative to the root of the repository, to \nthe `jacoco.csv` file, including filename.  It defaults \nto `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`, which is the default location and filename\nassuming you are using the JaCoCo Maven plugin and don\'t change the default\noutput location. Note that if you are using Gradle to run your build, you will\ndefinitely need to use this input, because the default location and name of the\njacoco csv report is different than it is in Maven. If you use Gradle\'s default\noutput directories, then you will need to set this input with something \nlike: `jacoco-csv-file: build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.csv`.\n\nIf you have a multi-module project, you can pass the paths (including filenames)\nto all of the `jacoco.csv` files for all of the sub-projects. Separate these by spaces,\nand in particular see the [Multi-Module Example Workflows](#multi-module-example-workflows)\nfor an example of how to do this. Multi-module support is limited to cases where\neach module has its own test coverage report, and where those reports don\'t overlap.\n\nYou can also use a glob pattern to specify the set of JaCoCo reports for your modules.\nFor example, `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/jacoco.csv""` will match all `jacoco.csv` files found\nacross all directories within your project. Or for example `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/*.csv""`\nwill match all `csv` files found within your project, but be careful with such a pattern\nif your project has other `csv` files that are not JaCoCo reports. Or as another example,\nmaybe all of your JaCoCo reports are in the same directory, but with names with numbers.\nThe pattern `jacoco-csv-file: ""target/site/jacoco/module*.csv""` will match all `csv` files\nin the directory `target/site/jacoco/` whose name begins with `module`. Note that in all of \nthese examples you need the quotes around the glob pattern or else GitHub Actions will \ngive you an error that your workflow file is invalid.\n\nThe action assumes that all reports passed via this input are \nindependent of each other. If you are using matrix testing, such that \neach group of tests produces a report, and where the groups overlap in what\nthey are testing (e.g., one group tests a portion of a class or method, \nand another group tests another portion, etc), then the coverage computed by \nthis action will not be correct. The csv reports don\'t contain enough information\nto properly merge such overlapping reports. If this applies to your use-case, then\nyou will need to have JaCoCo produce a single JaCoCo report first (for example, \nsee [jacoco:report-aggregate](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/report-aggregate-mojo.html)). \n\n#### `badges-directory`\n\nThis input is the directory for storing badges, relative to the root of the \nrepository. The default is `.github/badges`. The action will create the badges\ndirectory if it doesn\'t already exist, although the action itself does not commit.\n\n#### `generate-coverage-badge`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to generate the coverage badge (Instructions \nCoverage), and defaults to `true`.\n\n#### `coverage-badge-filename`\n\nThis input is the filename for the coverage badge (Instructions or C0 \nCoverage). The default filename \nis `jacoco.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be \ncreated within the `badges-directory`\ndirectory. __The action doesn\'t commit the badge file. You will \nneed to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__\n\n#### `generate-branches-badge`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to generate the branches coverage badge, and defaults\nto `false`. This defaults to `false` to avoid surprising users who upgrade from earlier\nversions with a badge they didn\'t know would be generated.\n\n#### `branches-badge-filename`\n\nThis input is the filename for the branches coverage badge (C1 \nCoverage). The default filename \nis `branches.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be \ncreated within the `badges-directory`\ndirectory. __The action doesn\'t commit the badge file. You will \nneed to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__\n\n#### `generate-coverage-endpoint`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to generate a JSON endpoint \nfor coverage (Instructions Coverage), and defaults to `false`.\n\n#### `coverage-endpoint-filename`\n\nThis input is the filename for the coverage endpoint (Instructions or C0 \nCoverage) if you have opted to generate a JSON endpoint instead of the\nbadge. The default filename is `jacoco.json`, and will be \ncreated within the `badges-directory`\ndirectory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will \nneed to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__\n\n#### `generate-branches-endpoint`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to generate a JSON endpoint \nfor branches coverage, and defaults to `false`.\n\n#### `branches-endpoint-filename`\n\nThis input is the filename for the branches coverage endpoint (C1 \nCoverage) if you have opted to generate a JSON endpoint instead of the\nbadge. The default filename is `branches.json`, and will be \ncreated within the `badges-directory`\ndirectory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will \nneed to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__\n\n#### `generate-summary`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to generate a simple JSON\nsummary report of the following form:\n\n```JSON\n{""branches"": 77.77777777777779, ""coverage"": 72.72727272727273}\n```\n\nThe default is `generate-summary: false`. To enable, use\n`generate-summary: true`.\n\n#### `summary-filename`\n\nThis input is the filename for the summary report (see above). The\ndefault is `summary-filename: coverage-summary.json`, and will be\ncreated within the `badges-directory`\ndirectory. __The action doesn\'t commit the JSON file. You will \nneed to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__\n\n#### `coverage-label`\n\nThis input is the text for the label on the left side of the coverage badge, which\ndefaults to `coverage`.\n\n#### `branches-label`\n\nThis input is the text for the label on the left side of the branches coverage badge, which\ndefaults to `branches`.\n\n#### `colors`\n\nThis input can be used to change the colors used for the badges.\nIt defaults to `colors: \'#4c1 #97ca00 #a4a61d #dfb317 #fe7d37 #e05d44\'`,\nwhich are the hex color codes for the colors described previously in \nsection [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme).\nBecause `#` has special meaning to YAML (it is used for comments), you \nmust either put quotes around the input value as shown in this example, or\nyou can escape each `#`. The list of colors that you pass here can either\nbe space separated (as shown) or comma separated. The colors in this list\ncan be specified either with hex (as in the example above), or with any\nnamed colors that are recognized by SVG, or some combination of the two.\nHere is an example with named \ncolors: `colors: green yellow orange red purple blue`. Notice that you don\'t need\nquotes around the input if none of the colors are specified by hex.\nAlthough the default uses six colors and six coverage intervals, you can have\nas many or as few as you want. For example, if you want to use `green` regardless\nof percentage, you can set colors like this: `colors: green`. If you pass more\ncolors than there are intervals, then the extra colors will be ignored. If you \npass an empty list of colors, then the action will simply use the default colors.\n__The action does not do any validation of the colors that you pass.__\n\n#### `intervals`\n\nThis input enables specifying the coverage intervals for the \ndifferent colors. It is a simple list of percentages. The default\nis `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`, which corresponds to what is\ndescribed in the section [Default Color Scheme](#default-color-scheme)\nearlier.  The action assumes that the percentages in this list are in \ndecreasing order. You can space separate or\ncomma separate the percentages. For example, `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`\nis equivalent to `intervals: 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 0`. A mix of spaces and commas\nwill also work.\n\nIf you specify too many intervals, the extras will simply be ignored. If there\nare C colors altogether, then only the first (C-1) percentages specified in \nthis input are used, with the last color designated for coverages that are below \nthat last cutoff.  For example, if you use the default set of 6 colors, then\n`intervals: 100 90 80 70 60` is equivalent to `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0`.\n\nAlthough these examples have integer percentages, the action \nsupports floating-point values. For example, you can specify something \nlike `intervals: 99.5 90 80 70 60`.\n\nIf you only want to use the first three default colors (bright green, green, \nand yellow green), then you don\'t necessarily need to change the value\nof the `colors` input. You can keep the default colors, and\nthen you can use something like `intervals: 80 60`, which will assign\n80 and above to bright green, 60 and above to green, and less than 60 to yellow\ngreen.\n\nIf you like some of the default colors, but want to skip over some of them,\nthen you can either use a combination of the `colors` input and `intervals`\ninput to accomplish this, or you can leave `colors` at the default and\nexploit the action\'s assumption of decreasing percentages in the `intervals`\ninput to skip the ones you don\'t like. For example, if \nyou want to use bright green for 80 and above, \nyellow for 60 and above, and red for less than 60, you might do something like the\nfollowing: `intervals: 80 80 80 60 60 0`. The 0 at the end is optional.  \n\n#### `on-missing-report`\n\nThis input controls what happens if one or more `jacoco.csv` files do not exist.\nThis input accepts one of three possible values: `fail`, `quiet`, or `badges`.\nThe behavior of these is defined as follows:\n* The default is `on-missing-report: fail`, in which case the action will \n  return a non-zero exit code (causing the workflow run to fail) if one \n  or more files listed in the `jacoco-csv-file` input do not exist, or if\n  an empty list of files is passed to the action. We recommend that you use\n  this default since missing coverage report files in most cases probably means\n  that there is either a bug in your workflow (e.g., typo in path to jacoco.csv)\n  or that something went wrong in an earlier step (e.g., unit tests failed, halting\n  generation of the coverage report).\n* You can use `on-missing-report: quiet` if you would rather the workflow\n  itself not fail, in which case the action will instead quietly exit \n  without producing badges if any JaCoCo reports are missing.\n* Although not recommended, a third option, `on-missing-report: badges`, will\n  cause the action to produce badges from the report files that do exist, simply\n  ignoring missing report files, provided that at least one such report file \n  exists. We do not recommend this option since such a case is likely due to an \n  error in your workflow, and any badges produced are likely computed with missing data.\n\nRegardless of value passed to this input, the action will log warnings for\nany files listed in the `jacoco-csv-file` input that do not exist, for your \ninspection in the workflow run. \n\n#### `fail-if-coverage-less-than`\n\nThis input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if\nthe computed coverage is less than a minimum. The default is 0, effectively\ndisabling the option. You can specify it as either a floating point value\nin the interval 0.0 to 1.0, or as a percent (with or without the percent sign).\nFor example, all of the following are equivalent: `fail-if-coverage-less-than: 0.6`,\n`fail-if-coverage-less-than: 60`, or `fail-if-coverage-less-than: ""60%""`.\nNote that in the last case, you need the quotes due to the percent sign.\nValues greater than 1 are assumed percents.\n\n#### `fail-if-branches-less-than`\n\nThis input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if\nthe computed branches coverage is less than a minimum. The default is 0, effectively\ndisabling the option. You can specify it as either a floating point value\nin the interval 0.0 to 1.0, or as a percent (with or without the percent sign).\nFor example, all of the following are equivalent: `fail-if-branches-less-than: 0.6`,\n`fail-if-branches-less-than: 60`, or `fail-if-branches-less-than: ""60%""`.\nNote that in the last case, you need the quotes due to the percent sign.\nValues greater than 1 are assumed percents.\n\n#### `fail-on-coverage-decrease`\n\nThis input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if\nthe computed coverage is less than it was on the previous run as recorded in either the\nexisting coverage badge, the existing coverage Shields endpoint, or the JSON summary \nreport (see the `generate-summary` input), if one of these exists. The default \nis `false`.  Use `fail-on-coverage-decrease: true` to enable. \n\nAdditionally, at least one of the `generate-summary`, `generate-coverage-badge`, \nor `generate-coverage-endpoint` inputs must also be `true`, as the action will otherwise assume\nthat there is no existing badge or summary report from which to get the prior coverage.\nIf more than one of these exist, this feature will use the summary report to determine if coverage\ndecreased since it is more precise than the truncated coverage percentage stored in \nthe badge or Shields endpoint. __Therefore, when using this feature, it is recommended that\nyou also set `generate-summary: true` and commit the summary report JSON file to the repository.__\n\n#### `fail-on-branches-decrease`\n\nThis input enables directing the action to fail the workflow run if\nthe computed branches coverage is less than it was on the previous run as recorded in either the\nexisting branches coverage badge, the existing branches coverage Shields endpoint, or the JSON summary \nreport (see the `generate-summary` input), if one of these exists. The default is `false`. \nUse `fail-on-branches-decrease: true` to enable. \n\nAdditionally, at least one of the `generate-summary`, `generate-branches-badge`, \nor `generate-branches-endpoint` inputs must also be `true`, as the action will otherwise assume\nthat there is no existing badge or summary report from which to get the prior coverage.\nIf more than one of these exist, this feature will use the summary report to determine if branches coverage\ndecreased since it is more precise than the truncated coverage percentage stored in \nthe badge or Shields endpoint. __Therefore, when using this feature, it is recommended that\nyou also set `generate-summary: true` and commit the summary report JSON file to the repository.__\n\n#### `generate-workflow-summary`\n\nThis input controls whether or not to log the coverage percentages to the GitHub Actions\nWorkflow Job Summary. The default is `generate-workflow-summary: true`. This input is only \nrelevant when running in GitHub Actions mode, and not when running as a CLI tool.\n\n\n### Outputs\n\nThe action also outputs the actual computed coverage percentages as double-precision\nfloating-point numbers. So you can add a step to your workflow to access these if \ndesired (these action outputs are values in the interval from 0.0 to 1.0).\n\n#### `coverage`\n\nThis output is the actual computed coverage percentage in the interval \nfrom 0.0 to 1.0.  This is coverage computed from the instructions\ncoverage data in the JaCoCo csv report.\n\n#### `branches`\n\nThis output is the actual computed branches coverage percentage \nin the interval from 0.0 to 1.0.  This is the percentage of branches\ncovered, computed from the branches data in the JaCoCo csv report.\n\n\n### Example Workflows\n\n#### Prerequisite: Running JaCoCo\n\n##### Running JaCoCo via Maven\n\nThe example workflows assume that you are using Maven to build and test\na Java project, and that you have the `jacoco-maven-plugin`\nconfigured in your `pom.xml` in the test phase with something\nalong the lines of the following:\n\n```XML\n<build>\n  <plugins>\n    <plugin>\n      <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>\n      <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n      <version>0.8.10</version>\n      <executions>\n        <execution>\n          <goals>\n            <goal>prepare-agent</goal>\n          </goals>\n        </execution>\n        <execution>\n          <id>generate-code-coverage-report</id>\n          <phase>test</phase>\n          <goals>\n            <goal>report</goal>\n          </goals>\n        </execution>\n      </executions>\n      </plugin>\n  </plugins>\n</build>\n```\n\nNote that the jacoco-badge-generator action has been tested with\nthe `jacoco.csv` files generated by `jacoco-maven-plugin` versions\n0.8.6 through 0.8.10, and has not been tested with earlier versions\nof JaCoCo.\n\n##### Running JaCoCo via Gradle\n\nIf you use gradle as your build tool, then you can configure JaCoCo\nin `build.gradle.kts` with:\n\n```Kotlin\nplugins {\n    jacoco\n}\n\ntasks.jacocoTestReport {\n    reports {\n        csv.isEnabled = true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr the equivalent in `build.gradle`:\n\n```Gradle\nplugins {\n    id \'jacoco\'\n}\n\njacocoTestReport {\n    reports {\n        csv.enabled true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Basic Action Syntax\n\nIf you use Maven as your build tool, then you will have steps\nin your workflow along the lines of the following (which assumes\nthat Maven is configured to run JaCoCo during the test phase:\n\n```yml\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n```\n\nThe equivalent for Gradle is:\n\n```yml\n      - name: Run Tests\n        run: ./gradlew test\n\n      - name: Run Test Coverage\n        run: ./gradlew jacocoTestReport\n\n      - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n        uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n        with:\n          generate-branches-badge: true\n          jacoco-csv-file: build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.csv\n```\n\nYou can also use a specific release with:\n\n```yml\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2.10.0\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n```\n\n#### All Possible Action Inputs\n\nThis shows a workflow step that uses all of the\npossible inputs of the `jacoco-badge-generator` action.\nIt simply shows all of the inputs with their default values.\nSee the [Inputs](#inputs) section for complete details of\nwhat these inputs do.\n\n```yml\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        jacoco-csv-file: target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n        badges-directory: .github/badges\n        generate-coverage-badge: true\n        coverage-badge-filename: jacoco.svg\n        generate-branches-badge: false\n        branches-badge-filename: branches.svg\n        generate-coverage-endpoint: false\n        coverage-endpoint-filename: jacoco.json\n        generate-branches-endpoint: false\n        branches-endpoint-filename: branches.json\n        generate-summary: false\n        summary-filename: coverage-summary.json\n        coverage-label: coverage\n        branches-label: branches\n        colors: \'#4c1 #97ca00 #a4a61d #dfb317 #fe7d37 #e05d44\'\n        intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0\n        on-missing-report: fail\n        fail-if-coverage-less-than: 0\n        fail-if-branches-less-than: 0\n        fail-on-coverage-decrease: false\n        fail-on-branches-decrease: false\n        generate-workflow-summary: true\n```\n\nSince the above shows all of the default values of the action inputs, \nit is equivalent to:\n\n```yml\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n```\n\n#### Example Workflow 1: Generate instructions (or C0) coverage badge only.\n\nThis sample workflow runs on pushes to the main\nbranch.  It first sets up Java, and runs the tests with Maven. If you\nhave JaCoCo configured to run during the test phase, this will also\nproduce the JaCoCo reports.  The jacoco-badge-generator action is then\nrun to parse the `jacoco.csv`, compute the coverage percentage, and\ngenerate the badge.  The coverage percentage is then logged in the\nworkflow so you can inspect later if necessary. The next step of the workflow\nchecks if any changes were made to the badge, and if so, does a commit and a push (note\nthat there are also GitHub Actions that you can use for that step). And \nfinally, the JaCoCo coverage reports are uploaded as a workflow\nartifact using the [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)\nGitHub Action, so you can inspect them if necessary.\n\n```yml\nname: build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up the Java JDK\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v2\n      with:\n        java-version: \'17\'\n        distribution: \'adopt\'\n\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      id: jacoco\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n\n    - name: Log coverage percentage\n      run: |\n        echo ""coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}""\n        echo ""branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}""\n\n    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)\n      run: |\n        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then\n          git config --global user.name \'YOUR NAME HERE\'\n          git config --global user.email \'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge""\n          git push\n        fi\n\n    - name: Upload JaCoCo coverage report\n      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n      with:\n        name: jacoco-report\n        path: target/site/jacoco/\n```\n\n#### Example Workflow 2: Generate instructions coverage and branches coverage badges.\n\nThis example workflow is just like the above example, however, it generates\nboth badges (instructions coverage percentage and branches coverage percentage).\nThis example also uses \nthe [EndBug/add-and-commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit) action to \ncommit and push the badge, whereas the previous example did this step with \nshell commands.\n\n```yml\nname: build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up the Java JDK\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v2\n      with:\n        java-version: \'17\'\n        distribution: \'adopt\'\n\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      id: jacoco\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n\n    - name: Log coverage percentage\n      run: |\n        echo ""coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}""\n        echo ""branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}""\n\n    - name: Commit and push the badge (if it changed)\n      uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7\n      with:\n        default_author: github_actions\n        message: \'commit badge\'\n        add: \'*.svg\'\n\n    - name: Upload JaCoCo coverage report\n      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n      with:\n        name: jacoco-report\n        path: target/site/jacoco/\n```\n\n### Multi-Module Example Workflows\n\n#### Example Workflow 3: Generate Instructions and Coverage Badges for a Multi-Module Project.\n\nThis example workflow generates both badges (instructions coverage percentage \nand branches coverage percentage) for a multi-module project. The badges that are generated\nare computed over all modules. To do so, simply pass the paths to all of the JaCoCo reports\nthat you want to include via the `jacoco-csv-file` input. The `>` is just Yaml\'s way of writing\na string across multiple lines. You can also just list all on a single space-separated line,\nbut your workflow file will be easier for you to read if you put them one per line.\nIn this example, there are three subprojects: `module1`, `module2`, and `module3`.\n\n```yml\nname: build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up the Java JDK\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v2\n      with:\n        java-version: \'17\'\n        distribution: \'adopt\'\n\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      id: jacoco\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n        jacoco-csv-file: >\n          module1/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n          module2/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n          module3/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n\n    - name: Log coverage percentage\n      run: |\n        echo ""coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}""\n        echo ""branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}""\n\n    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)\n      run: |\n        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then\n          git config --global user.name \'YOUR NAME HERE\'\n          git config --global user.email \'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge""\n          git push\n        fi\n```\n\n#### Example Workflow 4: Glob Pattern to Specify Reports of a Multi-Module Project.\n\nThis example workflow uses a glob pattern to specify the reports of a multi-module project,\nand generates both badges (instructions coverage percentage and branches coverage percentage). \nThe badges that are generated are computed over all modules. In this example, all of the JaCoCo\nreports are named `jacoco.csv` but reside in different directories. You can match all of them\nwith `jacoco-csv-file: ""**/jacoco.csv""`. The quotes around the glob are required to avoid an\ninvalid workflow error from GitHub Actions.\n\n```yml\nname: build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up the Java JDK\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v2\n      with:\n        java-version: \'17\'\n        distribution: \'adopt\'\n\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge\n      id: jacoco\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n        jacoco-csv-file: ""**/jacoco.csv""\n\n    - name: Log coverage percentage\n      run: |\n        echo ""coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}""\n        echo ""branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}""\n\n    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)\n      run: |\n        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then\n          git config --global user.name \'YOUR NAME HERE\'\n          git config --global user.email \'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge""\n          git push\n        fi\n```\n\n#### Example Workflow 5: Multi-Module Project with Separate Badges for Each Module.\n\nIf you would prefer to generate separate coverage badges for each of the\nmodules of a multi-module project, then just include multiple steps of the\n`jacoco-badge-generator` in your workflow, such as in this example. Be sure to use\nthe inputs to specify names for the badge files, otherwise with the defaults\nthe subsequent steps will overwrite the previous. This example assumes that there\nare two modules. You also will likely want to use the `coverage-label` and `branches-label`\ninputs to change the text on the left side of the badges if you are displaying badges\nfor multiple modules in the README of the same repository. This example demonstrates that\nas well.\n\n```yml\nname: build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up the Java JDK\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v2\n      with:\n        java-version: \'17\'\n        distribution: \'adopt\'\n\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B test\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badges for Module 1\n      id: jacocoMod1\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n        jacoco-csv-file: module1/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n        coverage-badge-filename: jacoco1.svg\n        branches-badge-filename: branches1.svg\n        coverage-label: coverage (module 1)\n        branches-label: branches (module 1)\n\n    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badges for Module 2\n      id: jacocoMod2\n      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v2\n      with:\n        generate-branches-badge: true\n        jacoco-csv-file: module2/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv\n        coverage-badge-filename: jacoco2.svg\n        branches-badge-filename: branches2.svg\n        coverage-label: coverage (module 2)\n        branches-label: branches (module 2)\n\n    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)\n      run: |\n        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then\n          git config --global user.name \'YOUR NAME HERE\'\n          git config --global user.email \'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge""\n          git push\n        fi\n```\n\n### Examples in Other Projects\n\n#### Template Repository with Runnable Workflow Examples \nWe now have\na [template repository](https://github.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator) \nwith a simple Maven Java project, using the `jacoco-maven-plugin`,\nalong with several live, runnable workflows to demonstrate a variety of use-cases\nfor the `jacoco-badge-generator` action. That repository,\n[cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/examples-jacoco-badge-generator),\nis a template so that you can potentially use it as a project starter. You can of course\nfork it instead. Its README\nexplains the contents of that repository, especially the details of the various \nworkflows it contains, and includes examples inserting the badges into its README.\n\n#### Live Real Examples\n\nIf you would like to see examples where the action is actively used, here \nare a few repositories that are actively using the `jacoco-badge-generator` action.\nThe table provides a link to repositories using the action, and direct links to the\nrelevant workflow as well as the relevant build configuration (e.g., Maven `pom.xml` \nor Gradle `build.gradle.kts`) so you can see how JaCoCo is \nconfigured. Note that in all of the Maven examples, JaCoCo is configured within a \nMaven profile within the `pom.xml`, which is then activated via a command line \noption when `mvn` is run by the workflow on all push/pull request events. Configuration \ncan instead be done in the `<build>` section if you\'d rather not use a profile.\n\n| Repository | Workflow | Build Configuration | \n| :----- | :----- | :-----|\n| [Chips-n-Salsa](https://github.com/cicirello/Chips-n-Salsa) | [build.yml](https://github.com/cicirello/Chips-n-Salsa/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) | [pom.xml](https://github.com/cicirello/Chips-n-Salsa/blob/master/pom.xml) |\n| [JavaPermutationTools](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools) | [build.yml](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) | [pom.xml](https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools/blob/master/pom.xml) |\n| [&rho;&mu;](https://github.com/cicirello/rho-mu) | [build.yml](https://github.com/cicirello/rho-mu/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) | [pom.xml](https://github.com/cicirello/rho-mu/blob/main/pom.xml) |\n| [XpathQS](https://github.com/nachg/xpathqs) | [build.yml](https://github.com/nachg/xpathqs/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) | [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/nachg/xpathqs/blob/master/build.gradle.kts) |\n\n\n## Command-Line Usage\n\nThe jacoco-badge-generator started its life as a GitHub Action, but due to interest can now\nbe used as a command-line utility outside of GitHub Actions. \n\n### Installing from PyPI\n\nThe jacoco-badge-generator requires Python 3 (and has been tested with 3.8 and above).\n\nTo install from PyPi (Unix and MacOS):\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m pip install jacoco-badge-generator\n```\n\nTo install from PyPi (Windows):\n\n```Shell\npy -m pip install jacoco-badge-generator\n```\n\nTo upgrade to the latest version from PyPi (Unix and MacOS):\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade jacoco-badge-generator\n```\n\nTo upgrade to the latest version from PyPi (Windows):\n\n```Shell\npy -m pip install --upgrade jacoco-badge-generator\n```\n\n### Running for the First Time\n\nAfter installing, we recommend running it once with the `-h` or `--help` flag\nto see the details of all of the available command-line options.\n\nOn Unix or MacOS:\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --help\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```Shell\npy -m jacoco_badge_generator --help\n```\n\n### CLI Examples\n\nAll GitHub Action inputs have a counterpart command-line option that can be\nused in CLI mode. See the [Inputs](#inputs) section earlier for details. If the GitHub \nActions input is named `input-name`, then in CLI mode, the corresponding command-line \noption is `--input-name`. All options are optional and provide relevant defaults \nfor the basic use-case. The defaults are nearly identical to those of the GitHub Action, \nwith a few exceptions.\n\nHere are a few examples. Note that all examples assume Unix (e.g., Python command is\n`python3`). If on Windows, just change `python3` to `py` in all of the examples below.\n\n#### All Defaults\n\nAs an example, from the root of your project (assuming you\'ve already run JaCoCo), execute\nthe following. In this example, all of the defaults are used, which will generate only the\ninstructions coverage badge, and will place it in a `badges` directory (creating it if it \ndoesn\'t exist). Note that the default directory for the generated badges is one of the differences\nbetween the defaults in CLI mode vs GitHub Actions mode.\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator\n```\n\n#### Generating Instructions Coverage and Branches Coverage Badges\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --generate-branches-badge true\n```\n\n#### Generating Shields JSON Endpoints Instead of Badges\n\nIf you want to generate Shields JSON endpoints instead of badges, you need\nto disable generating the coverage badge, and enable the JSON endpoints:\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --generate-coverage-badge false --generate-coverage-endpoint true --generate-branches-endpoint true\n```\n\n#### Changing Colors and Coverage Intervals\n\nIf you want to change the colors used and the coverage intervals for each color,\nyou can use the `--colors` and `--intervals` options. In the following example,\ngreen is used if coverage is at least 90 percent, yellow if coverage is less than 90 but\nat least 75 percent, orange is used if coverage is less than 75 percent but at least 60\npercent, and red is used if coverage is less than 60 percent.\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --colors green yellow orange red --intervals 90 75 60\n```\n\nColors can be specified as either SVG named colors as above or as 6-digit or 3-digit hex colors\n(see the [Inputs](#inputs) earlier for more detail).\n\n#### Changing the Badges Directory\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --badges-directory put/badges/here\n```\n\n#### Gradle Location of JaCoCo Report\n\nThe utility by default assumes that the JaCoCo report is the Maven default \nof `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`. If it is somewhere else, there is an option\nto specify its location. Here is an example with Gradle\'s standard location\nand name of the JaCoCo csv report.\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --jacoco-csv-file build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.csv\n```\n\n#### Multi-Module Example\n\nIf you have a multi-module project with multiple coverage reports that you want to combine (provided\nthey are independent), then you can specify the locations and names of all of the report files with\nsomething like:\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --jacoco-csv-file reports/report1.csv reports/report2.csv\n```\n\nIn CLI mode, glob patterns will be handled by your shell. You can accomplish the above with:\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --jacoco-csv-file reports/report*.csv\n```\n\nOr perhaps all of your reports are named `jacoco.csv` but in different directories, then you can\nmatch all of them with:\n\n```Shell\npython3 -m jacoco_badge_generator --jacoco-csv-file **/jacoco.csv\n```\n\n## Summary of Input Defaults\n\nThe following table summarizes the default values of all inputs for both the GitHub Actions\nusage as well as the CLI usage. If your use-case requires the defaults as specified below, then\nyou do not need to include them.\n\n| GitHub Actions Default | CLI Default |\n| --- | --- |\n| `jacoco-csv-file: target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` | `--jacoco-csv-file target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`<br>or<br>`-j target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` |\n| `badges-directory: .github/badges` | `--badges-directory badges`<br>or<br>`-d badges` |\n| `generate-coverage-badge: true` | `--generate-coverage-badge true` |\n| `coverage-badge-filename: jacoco.svg` | `--coverage-badge-filename jacoco.svg` |\n| `generate-branches-badge: false` | `--generate-branches-badge false` |\n| `branches-badge-filename: branches.svg` | `--branches-badge-filename branches.svg` |\n| `generate-coverage-endpoint: false` | `--generate-coverage-endpoint false` |\n| `coverage-endpoint-filename: jacoco.json` | `--coverage-endpoint-filename jacoco.json` |\n| `generate-branches-endpoint: false` | `--generate-branches-endpoint false` |\n| `branches-endpoint-filename: branches.json` | `--branches-endpoint-filename branches.json` |\n| `generate-summary: false` | `--generate-summary false` |\n| `summary-filename: coverage-summary.json` | `--summary-filename coverage-summary.json` |\n| `coverage-label: coverage` | `--coverage-label coverage` |\n| `branches-label: branches` | `--branches-label branches` |\n| `colors: \'#4c1 #97ca00 #a4a61d #dfb317 #fe7d37 #e05d44\'` | On Windows: `--colors #4c1 #97ca00 #a4a61d #dfb317 #fe7d37 #e05d44`<br>Bash or anywhere `#` has special meaning: `--colors \'#4c1\' \'#97ca00\' \'#a4a61d\' \'#dfb317\' \'#fe7d37\' \'#e05d44\'` |\n| `intervals: 100 90 80 70 60 0` | `--intervals 100 90 80 70 60 0` |\n| `on-missing-report: fail` | `--on-missing-report fail` |\n| `fail-if-coverage-less-than: 0` | `--fail-if-coverage-less-than 0` |\n| `fail-if-branches-less-than: 0` | `--fail-if-branches-less-than 0` |\n| `fail-on-coverage-decrease: false` | `--fail-on-coverage-decrease false` |\n| `fail-on-branches-decrease: false` | `--fail-on-branches-decrease false` |\n| `generate-workflow-summary: true` | n/a |\n\n## Blog Posts\n\nHere is a selection of blog posts about the jacoco-badge-generator on DEV.to:\n* [JaCoCo Coverage Badges for Multi-Module Projects in GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/cicirello/jacoco-coverage-badges-for-multi-module-projects-in-github-actions-ace), posted on DEV on May 25, 2023.\n* [Using GitHub Actions to Build a Java Project With Pull Request Coverage Commenting and Coverage Badges](https://dev.to/cicirello/using-github-actions-to-build-a-java-project-with-pull-request-coverage-commenting-and-coverage-badges-50a2), posted on DEV on November 9, 2022.\n* [The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action is now also available as a CLI tool from PyPI](https://dev.to/cicirello/the-jacoco-badge-generator-github-action-is-now-also-available-as-a-cli-tool-from-pypi-3ma0), posted on DEV on July 8, 2022.\n* [JaCoCo coverage badges, PR coverage checks, and PR coverage comments, from GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/cicirello/jacoco-coverage-badges-pr-coverage-checks-and-pr-coverage-comments-from-github-actions-4a8f), posted on DEV on November 29, 2021.\n\n## Support the Project\n\nYou can support the project in a number of ways:\n* __Starring__: If you find the `jacoco-badge-generator` action \n  useful, consider starring the repository.\n* __Sharing with Others__: Consider sharing it with others who\n  you feel might find it useful.\n* __Reporting Issues__: If you find a bug or have a suggestion for\n  a new feature, please report it via \n  the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/issues).\n* __Contributing Code__: If there is an open issue that you think\n  you can help with, submit a pull request.\n* __Sponsoring__: You can also consider \n  [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/cicirello).\n\n## License\n\nThis GitHub action is released under\nthe [MIT License](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

So here we provide an action to detect whether the user starred or forked or both done, then close & lock the issue if they don't.\n\n![image](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gii1f98s2jj30lt07jgmv.jpg)\n\n# How to use it?\n* Create a yml file, such as *checker.yml*, under `.github/workflow/` directory.\n* Waiting for someone to file an issue.\n\n## Simple usage\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, reopened]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    \n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Check issue actor\n      uses: fluttercandies/no-free-usage-action@v1.0.1\n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Parameters list\n| Name       | Description                                    | Required | Default value               | Supported value             |\n| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| token      | GitHub token for issue handling authorization. | true     | *************************** | ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} |\n| forked     | Whether required user forked the repository.   | false    | -f                          | -f / --no-forked            |\n| starred    | Whether required user starred the repository.  | false    | -s                          | -s / --no-starred           |\n| event_path | Event original file path for github workflow.  | false    | *************************** | /github/workflow/event.json |\n| words      | Reply content when closing.

See [Examples](#examples) for more information.\n> *   If [`fetch-depth`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) isn\'t set to `0`, ensure that `persist-credentials` is set to `true` when configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).\n> *   For repositories that have PRs generated from forks, when configuring [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage), set the [`repository`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) to `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}`.

It essentially enables parallel processing of workflows.\n\nAn additional benefit of dispatching is that it allows non-sensitive workloads to be run in public repositories to save using private repository GitHub Action minutes.\n\n<div align=""center""><img src=""docs/assets/slash-command-dispatch.png"" width=""550""></div>\n\n## Demos\n\nSee it in action with the following live demos.\n\n- [ChatOps Demo in Issues](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/issues/3)\n- [ChatOps Demo in Pull Requests](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/pull/8)\n- [Slash command code formatting - Python](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/pull/28)\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)\n- [Examples](docs/examples.md)\n- [Standard configuration](#standard-configuration)\n- [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md)\n- [Workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md)\n- [Updating to v3](docs/updating.md)\n\n## Dispatching commands\n\n### Standard configuration\n\nThe following workflow should be configured in the repository where commands will be dispatched from. This example will respond to comments containing the slash commands `/deploy`, `/integration-test` and `/build-docs`.\n\n```yml\nname: Slash Command Dispatch\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\njobs:\n  slashCommandDispatch:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Slash Command Dispatch\n        uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v3\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commands: |\n            deploy\n            integration-test\n            build-docs\n```\n\nNote that not specifying the `repository` input will mean that dispatch events are created in the *current* repository by default. It\'s perfectly fine to use the current repository and not dispatch events to a separate ""processor"" repository.\n\nThis action also features [advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) that allows each command to be configured individually if necessary. Use the standard configuration shown above unless you require advanced features.\n\n### Action inputs\n\n| Input | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `token` | (**required**) A `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Note: `GITHUB_TOKEN` *does not* work here. See [token](#token) for further details. | |\n| `reaction-token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). See [reaction-token](#reaction-token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| `reactions` | Add reactions. :eyes: = seen, :rocket: = dispatched | `true` |\n| `commands` | (**required**) A comma or newline separated list of commands. | |\n| `permission` | The repository permission level required by the user to dispatch commands. See [permission](#permission) for further details. (`none`, `read`, `triage`, `write`, `maintain`, `admin`) | `write` |\n| `issue-type` | The issue type required for commands. (`issue`, `pull-request`, `both`) | `both` |\n| `allow-edits` | Allow edited comments to trigger command dispatches. | `false` |\n| `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch events. | Current repository |\n| `event-type-suffix` | The repository dispatch event type suffix for the commands. | `-command` |\n| `static-args` | A comma or newline separated list of arguments that will be dispatched with every command. | |\n| `dispatch-type` | The dispatch type; `repository` or `workflow`. See [dispatch-type](#dispatch-type) for further details. | `repository` |\n| `config` | | JSON configuration for commands. See [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) | |\n| `config-from-file` | | JSON configuration from a file for commands. See [Advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) | |\n\n#### `token`\n\nThis action creates [repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) and [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events.\nThe default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have scopes to create these events, so a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required.\nIf you will be dispatching commands to public repositories *only* then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.\n\nWhen using the action in a GitHub organization, the user the PAT is created on must be a member of the organization.\nAdditionally, the PAT should be given the `org:read` scope.\n\n#### `reaction-token`\n\nIf you don\'t specify a token for `reaction-token` it will use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\nReactions to comments will then be made by the @github-actions bot user.\nYou can use a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you would prefer reactions to be made by the user account associated with the PAT. \n\n```yml\n      - name: Slash Command Dispatch\n        uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v3\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          reaction-token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commands: |\n            deploy\n            integration-test\n            build-docs\n```\n\n#### `permission`\n\nThis input sets the repository permission level required by the user to dispatch commands.\nIt expects one of the [five repository permission levels](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization), or `none`.\nFrom the least to greatest permission level they are `none`, `read`, `triage`, `write`, `maintain` and `admin`.\n\nSetting `write` as the required permission level means that any user with `write`, `maintain` or `admin` permission level will be able to execute commands.\n\nNote that `read`, `triage` and `maintain` are only applicable to organization repositories.\nFor repositories owned by a user account there are only two permission levels, the repository owner (`admin`) and collaborators (`write`).\n\nThere is a known issue with permissions when using [nested teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#nested-teams) in a GitHub organization. See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/issues/120) for further details.\n\n#### `dispatch-type`\n\nBy default, the action creates [repository_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) events.\nSetting `dispatch-type` to `workflow` will instead create [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events.\nThere are significant differences in the action\'s behaviour when using `workflow` dispatch. See [workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md) for usage details.\n\nFor the majority of use cases, the default `repository` dispatch will likely be the most suitable for new workflows.\nIf you already have `workflow_dispatch` workflows, you can execute them with slash commands using this action.\n\n| Repository Dispatch (default) | Workflow Dispatch |\n| --- | --- |\n| Events are created with a `client_payload` giving the target workflow access to a wealth of useful [context properties](#accessing-contexts). | A `client_payload` cannot be sent with [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) events. The target workflow can only make use of up to 10 pre-defined inputs, the names of which must match named arguments supplied with the slash command. |\n| Slash commands can only execute workflows in the target repository\'s default branch. | Slash commands can execute workflows in any branch using the `ref` named argument. The reference can be a branch, tag, or a commit SHA. This can be useful to test workflows in PR branches before merging. |\n| Immediate command validation feedback is unavailable when creating the dispatch event. | Immediate command [validation feedback](docs/workflow-dispatch.md#validation-errors) is available as an action output. |\n\n### How comments are parsed for slash commands\n\nSlash commands must be placed in the first line of the comment to be interpreted as a command.\n\n- The command must start with a `/`\n- The slash command extends to the last non-whitespace character on the first line\n- Anything after the first line is ignored and can be freely used for comments\n\n![Comment Parsing](docs/assets/comment-parsing.png)\n\n## Handling dispatched commands\n\nThe following documentation applies to the `dispatch-type` default, `repository`, which creates [repository_dispatch](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event) events.\nFor `workflow` dispatch documentation, see [workflow dispatch](docs/workflow-dispatch.md).\n\n### Event types\n\nRepository dispatch events have a `type` to distinguish between events. The `type` set by the action is a combination of the slash command and `event-type-suffix`. The `event-type-suffix` input defaults to `-command`.\n\nFor example, if your slash command is `integration-test`, the event type will be `integration-test-command`.\n\n```yml\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [integration-test-command]\n```\n\n### Accessing contexts\n\nCommands are dispatched with a payload containing a number of contexts.\n\n#### `slash_command` context\n\nThe slash command context contains the command and any arguments that were supplied by the user.\nIt will also contain any static arguments if configured.\n\nTo demonstrate, take the following configuration as an example.\n```yml\n      - uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v3\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commands: |\n            deploy\n          static-args: |\n            production\n            region=us-east-1\n```\n\nFor the above example configuration, the slash command `/deploy branch=main dry-run reason=""new feature""` will be converted to a JSON payload as follows.\n\n```json\n    ""slash_command"": {\n        ""command"": ""deploy"",\n        ""args"": {\n            ""all"": ""production region=us-east-1 branch=main dry-run reason=\\""new feature\\"""",\n            ""unnamed"": {\n                ""all"": ""production dry-run"",\n                ""arg1"": ""production"",\n                ""arg2"": ""dry-run""\n            },\n            ""named"": {\n                ""region"": ""us-east-1"",\n                ""branch"": ""main"",\n                ""reason"": ""new feature""\n            },\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThe properties in the `slash_command` context from the above example can be used in a workflow as follows.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Output command and arguments\n        run: |\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.command }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.all }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.unnamed.all }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.unnamed.arg1 }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.unnamed.arg2 }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.named.region }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.named.branch }}\n          echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.slash_command.args.named.reason }}\n          # etc.\n```\n\n#### `github` and `pull_request` contexts\n\nThe payload contains the `github` context of the `issue_comment` event at path `github.event.client_payload.github`.\nAdditionally, if the comment was made in a pull request, the action calls the [GitHub API to fetch the pull request detail](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) and attach it to the payload at path `github.event.client_payload.pull_request`.\n\nYou can inspect the payload with the following step.\n```yml\n      - name: Dump the client payload context\n        env:\n          PAYLOAD_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github.event.client_payload) }}\n        run: echo ""$PAYLOAD_CONTEXT""\n```\n\nNote that the `client_payload.github.payload.issue.body` and `client_payload.pull_request.body` context properties will be truncated if they exceed 1000 characters.\n\n### Responding to the comment on command completion\n\nUsing [create-or-update-comment](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-comment) action there are a number of ways you can respond to the comment once the command has completed.\n\nThe simplest response is to add a :tada: reaction to the comment.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Add reaction\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.repository.full_name }}\n          comment-id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.comment.id }}\n          reaction-type: hooray\n```\n\nAnother option is to reply with a new comment containing a link to the run output.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create URL to the run output\n        id: vars\n        run: echo ""run-url=https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$GITHUB_RUN_ID"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - name: Create comment\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.repository.full_name }}\n          issue-number: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.issue.number }}\n          body: |\n            [Command run output][1]\n\n            [1]: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.run-url }}\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
688,"b'# Repo Visualizer\n\nA GitHub Action that creates an SVG diagram of your repo. Read more [in the writeup](https://octo.github.com/projects/repo-visualization).\n\n**Please note that this is an experiment. If you have feature requests, please submit a PR or fork and use the code any way you need.**\n\nFor a full demo, check out the [githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo) repository.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `output_file`\n\nA path (relative to the root of your repo) to where you would like the diagram to live.\n\nFor example: images/diagram.svg\n\nDefault: diagram.svg\n\n### `excluded_paths`\n\nA list of paths to folders to exclude from the diagram, separated by commas.\n\nFor example: dist,node_modules\n\nDefault: node_modules,bower_components,dist,out,build,eject,.next,.netlify,.yarn,.vscode,package-lock.json,yarn.lock\n\n### `excluded_globs`\n\nA semicolon-delimited array of file [globs](https://globster.xyz/) to exclude from the diagram, using [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) syntax. Provided as an array.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\nexcluded_globs: ""frontend/*.spec.js;**/*.{png,jpg};**/!(*.module).ts""\n# Guide:\n# - \'frontend/*.spec.js\' # exclude frontend tests\n# - \'**/*.{png,ico,md}\'  # all png, ico, md files in any directory\n# - \'**/!(*.module).ts\'  # all TS files except module files\n```\n\n### `root_path`\n\nThe directory (and its children) that you want to visualize in the diagram, relative to the repository root.\n\nFor example: `src/`\n\nDefault: `\'\'` (current directory)\n\n### `max_depth`\n\nThe maximum number of nested folders to show files within. A higher number will take longer to render.\n\nDefault: 9\n\n### `should_push`\n\nWhether to make a new commit with the diagram and push it to the original repository.\n\nShould be a boolean value, i.e. `true` or `false`. See `commit_message` and `branch` for how to customise the commit.\n\nDefault: `true`\n\n### `commit_message`\n\nThe commit message to use when updating the diagram. Useful for skipping CI. For example: `Updating diagram [skip ci]`\n\nDefault: `Repo visualizer: updated diagram`\n\n### `branch`\n\nThe branch name to push the diagram to (branch will be created if it does not yet exist).\n\nFor example: `diagram`\n\n### `artifact_name`\n\nThe name of an [artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) to create containing the diagram.\n\nIf unspecified, no artifact will be created.\n\nDefault: `\'\'` (no artifact)\n\n### `file_colors`\n\nYou can customize the colors for specific file extensions. Key/value pairs will extend the [default colors](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer/pull/src/language-colors.json).\n\nFor example: \'{""js"": ""red"",""ts"": ""green""}\'\ndefault: \'{}\'\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `svg`\n\nThe contents of the diagram as text. This can be used if you don\'t want to handle new files.\n\n## Example usage\n\nYou\'ll need to run the `actions/checkout` Action beforehand, to check out the code.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Checkout code\n  uses: actions/checkout@master\n- name: Update diagram\n  uses: githubocto/repo-visualizer@0.7.1\n  with:\n    output_file: ""images/diagram.svg""\n    excluded_paths: ""dist,node_modules""\n```\n\n\n## Accessing the diagram\n\nBy default, this action will create a new commit with the diagram on the specified branch.\n\nIf you want to avoid new commits, you can create an artifact to accompany the workflow run,\nby specifying an `artifact_name`. You can then download the diagram using the\n[`actions/download-artifact`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/download-a-build-artifact)\naction from a later step in your workflow,\nor by using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#artifacts).\n\nExample:\n```yaml\n- name: Update diagram\n  id: make_diagram\n  uses: githubocto/repo-visualizer@0.7.1\n  with:\n    output_file: ""output-diagram.svg""\n    artifact_name: ""my-diagram""\n- name: Get artifact\n  uses: actions/download-artifact@v2\n  with:\n    name: ""my-diagram""\n    path: ""downloads""\n```\nIn this example, the diagram will be available at downloads/my-diagram.svg\nNote that this will still also create a commit, unless you specify `should_push: false`!\n\nAlternatively, the SVG description of the diagram is available in the `svg` output,\nwhich you can refer to in your workflow as e.g. `${{ steps.make_diagram.outputs.svg }}`.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0)

Teams](/docs/teams.md)\n* [Webhooks](/docs/webhook.md)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n<details>\n  <summary>The action is printing an empty table.</summary>\n\n  1. Make sure the repositories have pull request reviews during the configured `period`.\n  2. When specifying `repositories` or `organization` parameters, a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required in the `token` parameter.\n  3. If providing a Personal Access Token, ensure it has the `repo` permission for the projects you want.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>I get the error ""Error commenting on the pull request..."".</summary>\n\n  This error happens when the organization configures the action\'s permissions as `read`. To fix it, overwrite them by adding a [`permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) configuration in the workflow file. The minimum required permissions are `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`:\n\n  ```yml\n  jobs:\n    stats:\n      runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n      permissions:\n        contents: read\n        pull-requests: write\n      steps:\n        - name: Run pull request stats\n          uses: flowwer-dev/pull-request-stats@master\n  ```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>I\'m a sponsor but still getting the error ""...is a premium feature, available to sponsors"".</summary>\n\n  1. Check the sponsorship comes from the account that owns the configured repos (usually an organization).\n  2. Make sure the sponsorship is configured as `public`, otherwise, the action cannot access the sponsorship information. If you prefer to keep it `private`, please reach me out to make it work for you that way \xf0\x9f\x98\x89.\n</details>\n\n## Premium features \xe2\x9c\xa8\n\nThis action offers some premium features only for sponsors:\n\n* Disabling telemetry.\n* Slack integration.\n* Microsoft Teams integration.\n* Coming soon: Discord integration, web version.\n\nThe **suggested sponsorship is $20 USD / month**. However, if it\'s not possible for you or your organization, please consider supporting it with any amount you can. Even a one-time sponsorship will enable the Premium features and encourage the progress of this project.\n\nBeing a sponsor will also give you access to the premium features in all of my [other projects](#related-projects).\n\nThanks for your support! \xf0\x9f\x92\x99\n\n## Related projects \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5\n\n* **[Recap](https://github.com/flowwer-dev/recap)**: Tired of writing pull request descriptions?

Library\nrepositories with only a `Cargo.toml` file have limited benefits, as cargo will\n_always_ use the most up-to-date dependency versions, which may not be cached.\n\nUsage with Stable Rust is most effective, as a cache is tied to the Rust version.\nUsing it with Nightly Rust is less effective as it will throw away the cache every day,\nunless a specific nightly build is being pinned.\n\n## Cache Details\n\nThis action currently caches the following files/directories:\n\n- `~/.cargo` (installed binaries, the cargo registry, cache, and git dependencies)\n- `./target` (build artifacts of dependencies)\n\nThis cache is automatically keyed by:\n\n- the github [`job_id`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_id),\n- the rustc release / host / hash,\n- the value of some compiler-specific environment variables (eg. RUSTFLAGS, etc), and\n- a hash of all `Cargo.lock` / `Cargo.toml` files found anywhere in the repository (if present).\n- a hash of all `rust-toolchain` / `rust-toolchain.toml` files in the root of the repository (if present).\n- a hash of all `.cargo/config.toml` files in the root of the repository (if present).\n\nAn additional input `key` can be provided if the builtin keys are not sufficient.\n\nBefore being persisted, the cache is cleaned of:\n\n- Any files in `~/.cargo/bin` that were present before the action ran (for example `rustc`).\n- Dependencies that are no longer used.\n- Anything that is not a dependency.\n- Incremental build artifacts.\n- Any build artifacts with an `mtime` older than one week.\n\nIn particular, the workspace crates themselves are not cached since doing so is\n[generally not effective](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache/issues/37#issuecomment-944697938).\nFor this reason, this action automatically sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` to disable\nincremental compilation, so that the Rust compiler doesn\'t waste time creating\nthe additional artifacts required for incremental builds.\n\nThe `~/.cargo/registry/src` directory is not cached since it is quicker for Cargo\nto recreate it from the compressed crate archives in `~/.cargo/registry/cache`.\n\nThe action will try to restore from a previous `Cargo.lock` version as well, so\nlockfile updates should only re-build changed dependencies.\n\nThe action invokes `cargo metadata` to determine the current set of dependencies.\n\nAdditionally, the action automatically works around\n[cargo#8603](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8603) /\n[actions/cache#403](https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/403) which would\notherwise corrupt the cache on macOS builds.\n\n## Cache Limits and Control\n\nThis specialized cache action is built on top of the upstream cache action\nmaintained by GitHub. The same restrictions and limits apply, which are\ndocumented here:\n[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)\n\nIn particular, caches are currently limited to 10 GB in total and exceeding that\nlimit will cause eviction of older caches.\n\nCaches from base branches are available to PRs, but not across unrelated\nbranches.\n\nThe caches can be controlled using the [Cache API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache)\nwhich allows listing existing caches and manually removing entries.\n\n## Debugging\n\nThe action prints detailed information about which information it considers\nfor its cache key, and it outputs more debug-only information about which\ncleanup steps it performs before persisting the cache.\n\nYou can read up on how to [enable debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)\nto see those details as well as further details related to caching operations.\n\n## Known issues\n\n- The cache cleaning process currently removes all the files from `~/.cargo/bin`\n  that were present before the action ran (for example `rustc`).\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

You can use\nany of the [supported markup languages] like MediaWiki, Markdown, or AsciiDoc.\n\n\xf0\x9f\x94\x91 In order to successfully push to the `.wiki.git` Git repository that backs\nthe wiki tab, we need the `contents: write` permission! Make sure you have\nsomething like shown above either for your entire workflow, or just for one\nparticular job. This will give the auto-generated `${{ github.token }}` that we\nuse by default permission to push to the `.wiki.git` repo of the repository that\nthe action runs on.\n\n<img align=""right"" alt=""Screenshot of \'Create the first page\' button"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/ABKIS4h.png"" />\n\n\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f You must create a dummy page manually! This is what initially creates the\nGitHub wiki Git-based storage backend that we then push to in this Action.\n\nAfter creating your workflow file, now all you need is to put your Markdown\nfiles in a `wiki/` folder (or whatever you set the `path` option to) and commit\nthem to your default branch to trigger the workflow (or whatever other trigger\nyou set up).\n\n\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 Each page has an auto-generated title. It is derived from the filename by\nreplacing every `-` (dash) character with a space. Name your files accordingly.\nThe `Home.md` file will automatically become the homepage, not `README.md`. This\nis specific to GitHub wikis.\n\n### Inputs\n\n- **`strategy`:** Select from `clone` or `init` to determine which method to use\n  to push changes to the GitHub wiki. `clone` will clone the `.wiki.git` repo\n  and add an additional commit. `init` will create a new repo with a single\n  commit and force push to the `.wiki.git`. `init` involves a force-push! The\n  default is `clone`.\n\n- **`repository`:** The repository housing the wiki. Use this if you\'re\n  publishing to a wiki that\'s not the current repository. You can change the\n  GitHub server with the `github-server-url` input. Default is\n  `${{ github.repository }}`.\n\n- **`github-server-url`:** An alternate `https://github.com` URL, usually for\n  GitHub Enterprise deployments under your own domain. Default is\n  `${{ github.server_url }}` (usually `https://github.com`).\n\n- **`token`:** `${{ github.token }}` is the default. This token is used when\n  cloning and pushing wiki changes.\n\n- **`path`:** The directory to use for your wiki contents. Default `wiki/`.\n\n- **`commit-message`:** The message to use when committing new content. Default\n  is `Update wiki ${{ github.sha }}`. You probably don\'t need to change this,\n  since this only applies if you look really closely in your wiki.\n\n- **`ignore`:** A multiline list of files that should be ignored when committing\n  and pushing to the remote wiki. Each line is a pattern like `.gitignore`. Make\n  sure these paths are relative to the path option! The default is none.\n\n- **`dry-run`:** Whether or not to actually attempt to push changes back to the\n  wiki itself. If this is set to `true`, we instead print the remote URL and do\n  not push to the remote wiki. The default is `false`. This is useful for\n  testing.\n\n- **`preprocess`:** If this option is true, we will preprocess the wiki to move\n  the `README.md` to `Home.md` as well as rewriting all `.md` links to be bare\n  links. This helps ensure that the Markdown works in source control as well as\n  the wiki. The default is true.\n\n#### `strategy:` input\n\nThere are some specific usecases where using `strategy: init` might be better\nthan the default `strategy: clone`.\n\n1. **Your wiki is enormous.** And I don\'t mean in terms of text. Text is nothing\n   compared with images. If your wiki has a lot of included images, then you\n   probably don\'t want to store the complete history of those large binary\n   files. Instead, you can use `strategy: init` to create a single commit each\n   time.\n\n2. **You prefer the ""deploy"" semantics.** If you just like the feel of having\n   your GitHub wiki act more like GitHub Pages, that\'s great! You can `--force`\n   push using `strategy: init` on each wiki deployment and none of that pesky\n   history will be saved.\n\n### Outputs\n\n- **`wiki_url`:** The HTTP URL that points to the deployed repository\'s wiki\n  tab. This is essentially the concatenation of `${{ github.server_url }}`,\n  `${{ github.repository }}`, and the `/wiki` page.\n\n### Cross-repo wikis\n\nYou _can_ use this action to deploy your octocat/mega-docs repository to the\noctocat/mega-project repository\'s wiki tab! You just need to:\n\n1. Create a custom GitHub Personal Access Token with the permissions to push to\n   the octocat/mega-project repository. That\'s the target repo where your wiki\n   pages will be pushed to the `.wiki.git`.\n2. In the octocat/mega-docs repo (the source code for the wiki), you need to set\n   the `repository:` option to `repository: octocat/mega-project` to tell the\n   action to push there.\n3. You need to set the `token:` option to the Personal Access Token that you\n   created with the ability to push to the wiki Git repo. You can use repository\n   secrets for this! Something like `token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}` is good!\n\nHere\'s an example of the octocat/mega-docs repo that will push the contents of\nthe root folder (`./`) to the octocat/mega-project repo\'s wiki tab!\n\n```yml\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\njobs:\n  publish-wiki:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: Andrew-Chen-Wang/github-wiki-action@v4\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.MEGA_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          repository: octocat/mega-project\n          path: .\n```\n\n## Development\n\n![Deno](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Deno&color=000000&logo=Deno&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)\n![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=GitHub+Actions&color=2088FF&logo=GitHub+Actions&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)\n\nThis GitHub Action uses a self-downloaded version of Deno. See `cliw` for the\n`cli.ts` wrapper script that downloads the Deno binary and runs the TypeScript\ncode. The main script itself is ~100 lines of code, so it\'s not too bad.\n\n\xe2\x84\xb9 Because the version of Deno is _pinned_, it\'s recommended to every-so-often\nbump it to the latest version.\n\nTo test the action, open a PR! The `test-action.yml` workflow will run the code\nwith `dry-run: true` as well as a real run! Yes, this does get tedious swapping\nbetween your IDE and the PR, but it\'s the easiest way to test the action.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action#11]: https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action/issues/11\n[supported markup languages]: https://github.com/github/markup#markups\n[PAT]: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

authenticate against [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) it\'s strongly recommended to create a\n[personal access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) as an alternative to your password.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to Docker Hub\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### GitHub Container Registry\n\nTo authenticate against the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry),\nuse the [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow) for the best\nsecurity and experience.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to GitHub Container Registry\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: ghcr.io\n          username: ${{ github.actor }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nYou may need to [manage write and read access of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions#upgrading-a-workflow-that-accesses-ghcrio)\nfor repositories in the container settings.\n\nYou can also use a [personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\nwith the [appropriate scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#authenticating-with-the-container-registry).\n\n### GitLab\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to GitLab\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: registry.gitlab.com\n          username: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_USERNAME }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\nIf you have [Two-Factor Authentication](https://gitlab.com/help/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication) enabled, use a [Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens) instead of a password.\n\n### Azure Container Registry (ACR)\n\n[Create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#create-a-service-principal)\nwith access to your container registry through the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\nand take note of the generated service principal\'s ID (also called _client ID_) and password (also called _client secret_).\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to ACR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: <registry-name>.azurecr.io\n          username: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}\n```\n\n> Replace `<registry-name>` with the name of your registry.\n\n### Google Container Registry (GCR)\n\n> [Google Artifact Registry](#google-artifact-registry-gar) is the evolution of Google Container Registry. As a\n> fully-managed service with support for both container images and non-container artifacts. If you currently use\n> Google Container Registry, use the information [on this page](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr)\n> to learn about transitioning to Google Artifact Registry. \n\nYou can use either workload identity federation based keyless authentication or service account based authentication.\n\n#### Workload identity federation based authentication\n\nConfigure the workload identity federation for github actions in gcloud (for steps, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)). In the steps, your service account should the ability to push to GCR. Then use google-github-actions/auth action for authentication using workload identity like below:\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - id: \'auth\'\n      name: \'Authenticate to Google Cloud\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/auth@v0\'\n      with:\n        token_format: \'access_token\'\n        workload_identity_provider: \'<workload_identity_provider>\'\n        service_account: \'<service_account>\'\n\n    - name: Login to GCR\n      uses: docker/login-action@v2\n      with:\n        registry: gcr.io\n        username: oauth2accesstoken\n        password: ${{ steps.auth.outputs.access_token }}\n```\n\n> Replace `<workload_identity_provider>` with configured workload identity provider. For steps to configure, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation).\n\n> Replace `<service_account>` with configured service account in workload identity provider which has access to push to GCR\n\n#### Service account based authentication\n\nUse a service account with the ability to push to GCR and [configure access control](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control).\nThen create and download the JSON key for this service account and save content of `.json` file\n[as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)\ncalled `GCR_JSON_KEY` in your GitHub repo. Ensure you set the username to `_json_key`,\nor `_json_key_base64` if you use a base64-encoded key.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to GCR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: gcr.io\n          username: _json_key\n          password: ${{ secrets.GCR_JSON_KEY }}\n```\n\n### Google Artifact Registry (GAR)\n\nYou can use either workload identity federation based keyless authentication or  service account based authentication.\n\n#### Workload identity federation based authentication\n\nConfigure the workload identity federation for github actions in gcloud (for steps, [refer here](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setting-up-workload-identity-federation)). In the steps, your service account should the ability to push to GAR. Then use google-github-actions/auth action for authentication using workload identity like below:\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - id: \'auth\'\n        name: \'Authenticate to Google Cloud\'\n        uses: \'google-github-actions/auth@v0\'\n        with:\n          token_format: \'access_token\'\n          workload_identity_provider: \'<workload_identity_provider>\'\n          service_account: \'<service_account>\'\n      \n      - name: Login to GAR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: <location>-docker.pkg.dev\n          username: oauth2accesstoken\n          password: ${{ steps.auth.outputs.access_token }}\n```\n> Replace `<workload_identity_provider>` with configured workload identity provider\n\n> Replace `<service_account>` with configured service account in workload identity provider which has access to push to GCR\n\n> Replace `<location>` with the regional or multi-regional [location](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repo-organize#locations)\n> of the repository where the image is stored.\n\n#### Service account based authentication\n\nUse a service account with the ability to push to GAR and [configure access control](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control).\nThen create and download the JSON key for this service account and save content of `.json` file\n[as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)\ncalled `GAR_JSON_KEY` in your GitHub repo. Ensure you set the username to `_json_key`,\nor `_json_key_base64` if you use a base64-encoded key.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to GAR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: <location>-docker.pkg.dev\n          username: _json_key\n          password: ${{ secrets.GAR_JSON_KEY }}\n```\n\n> Replace `<location>` with the regional or multi-regional [location](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repo-organize#locations)\n> of the repository where the image is stored.\n\n### AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)\n\nUse an IAM user with the ability to [push to ECR with `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser` managed policy for example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html#AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser).\nThen create and download access keys and save `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` [as secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)\nin your GitHub repo.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to ECR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: <aws-account-number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com\n          username: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n```\n\nIf you need to log in to Amazon ECR registries associated with other accounts, you can use the `AWS_ACCOUNT_IDS`\nenvironment variable:\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Login to ECR\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n

AWS_ACCOUNT_IDS: 012345678910,023456789012\n```\n\n> Only available with [AWS CLI version 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/get-login.html)\n\nYou can also use the [Configure AWS Credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) action in\ncombination with this action:\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\njobs:\n  login:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Configure AWS Credentials\n        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n        with:\n          aws-access-key-id: ${{

docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          registry: <aws-account-number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com\n```\n\n> Replace `<aws-account-number>` and `<region>` with their respective values.\n\n### AWS Public Elastic Container Registry (ECR)\n\nUse an IAM user with the ability to [push to ECR Public with `AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicPowerUser` managed policy for example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-ecr-managed-policies.html#AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicPowerUser).\nThen create and download access keys and save `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` [as secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)\nin your GitHub

697,"b'# GitHub Action: Retrieve issues closed by commits\nThis simple Action provides you a way to retrieve issues that were recently closed via a commit.<br>\nThe GitHub API currently does not allow us to retrieve that information in any easily accessible way, hence why I made this Action myself.\n\nThis Action adheres to the syntax of [Closing issues via keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) provided by GitHub.\nIt also works with multiple issues being closed in the same commit and it is case-insensitive.<br>\nExamples:\n* Fixed #123\n* Resolves #123\n* In this commit we closed #123\n* Closed #123 I have\n* Closed #123 but also fixed #124\n\nThis can be very useful if you want to assign labels to closed tickets for example.<br>\n[You can find an example workflow right here](#assign-a-label-to-an-issue-if-it-was-closed-by-a-ticket)\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `token`\n**Required** The token is just a standard Access Token from GitHub, this is used for authentication.<br>\nYou can use the built-in ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} variable for this.\n\n### `max_commits`\n**Required** This parameter determines how many commits should be retrieved. The maximal value for this is 100.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `issues`\nThe output of this is a JSON Array of numbers, corresponding to the issue numbers that were closed via commits.\n\n## Example usages\n\n### Print out recently closed tickets\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issue:\n    types:\n      - closed\n\njobs:\n  scan:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: TheBusyBiscuit/recently-closed-issues@master\n        id: my_step_id\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        max_commits: 20\n      - run: echo $ {{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.issues }}\n```\n\n### Assign a label to an issue if it was closed by a ticket\nThis example will add a ""Resolved"" label to any issue that was closed via a commit.<br>\nI am using the GitHub Action [maxkomarychev/octions@master](https://github.com/maxkomarychev/octions) to add the label, any action that can add labels will suffice though, this is just an example.\n\nYou can use GitHub\'s [expressions syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#contains) to create a simple if-statement that will make a step only trigger if the currently closed issue was closed via a commit.\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issue:\n    types:\n      - closed\n\njobs:\n  label:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: TheBusyBiscuit/recently-closed-issues@master\n        id: my_step_id\n        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        max_commits: 20\n      - uses: maxkomarychev/octions/octions/issues/add-labels@master\n        if: contains(toJson(steps.my_step_id.outputs.issues), github.event.issue.number)\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}\n          labels: \'Resolved\'\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

It will also track the\nlatest release of `fossa-cli`.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Push-only API token\n\nIf you are an open-source project maintainer, you probably want to check pull\nrequests from external contributors with FOSSA, but it's impossible to do with\nsecrets when the workflow runs on the pull request event due to GitHub's\nconstraints. However, FOSSA has the\n[push-only API](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token)\ntoken, allowing you to safely check pull requests.\n\nThere is no problem with this:\n\n```yml\n- name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data\n  uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2\n  with:\n    fossa-api-key: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n  #                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nThis will cause an error on the pull request event:\n\n```yml\n- name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data\n  uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2\n  with:\n    fossa-api-key: ${{ secrets.FOSSA_API_KEY }}\n  #                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\n#### References\n\n- https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token\n- https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests\n\n### How to specify the version\n\nThere is a point that is particularly easy to misunderstand.

We adhere to\n[semantic versioning](https://semver.org), it's safe to use the major version\n(`v1`) in your workflow. If you use the master branch, this could break your\nworkflow when we publish a breaking update and increase the major version.\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  # Reference the major version of a release (most recommended)\n  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2\n  # Reference a specific commit (most strict)\n  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@6728dc6\n  # Reference a semver version of a release (not recommended)\n  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2.0.0\n  # Reference a branch (most dangerous)\n  - uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@master\n```\n\n### Example workflow\n\n```yml\nname: License Scanning\n\non:\n  - pull_request\n  - push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout tree\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Run FOSSA scan and upload build data\n        uses: fossa-contrib/fossa-action@v2\n        with:\n          fossa-api-key: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `fossa-api-key`: This input is used to upload the results of the build\n  analysis.\n- `github-token`: This input is used to get the latest release of `fossa-cli`\n  from GitHub API.\n- `endpoint`: This input is used to specify which fossa endpoint to use.\n- `skip-test`: This input is used to specify whether to execute\n  [`fossa test`](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md/#fossa-test).\n  This takes a long time, so it's set to `true` by default.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

JSDoc [templates](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc#templates) are also supported.\n\nThe following example [workflow step](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) will generate documentation for all source files in the `./src` directory and output the built files to the `./out` directory.\n\n```yml\n- name: Build\n  uses: andstor/jsdoc-action@v1\n  with:\n    source_dir: ./src\n    recurse: true\n    output_dir: ./out\n```\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nThe jsdoc-action is a JavaScript action and is supported on both Linux, MacOS and Windows. The action supports stable versions of Node.js 14 and later. \n\n| OS (runs-on) | ubuntu-latest | macos-latest | windows-latest |\n|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Support | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f | \xe2\x9c\x85\xef\xb8\x8f |\n\n## Options \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f\n\nThe following input variables options can/must be configured:\n\n|Input variable|Necessity|Description|Default|\n|----|----|----|----|\n|`source_dir`|Optional|Source directory to build documentation from.||\n|`output_dir`|Optional|Output folder for the generated documentation.|`./out`|\n|`recurse`|Optional|Recurse into subdirectories when scanning for source files.|`false`|\n|`config_file`|Optional|The path to a JSDoc configuration file.||\n|`template`|Optional|The JSDoc template package to install. Will run `npm install template`.||\n|`template_dir`|Optional|The relative location of the template files directory within the template package.||\n|`front_page`|Optional|The path to a Markdown file to be used as a the front page. Normally `README.md`.||\n\n## Templates \xf0\x9f\x92\x85\n\nYou can use JSDoc [templates](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc#templates) with this action.  \nJust set the `template` input variable to the name of the template you want to use. This needs to be template's package name.\n\nIf the template's template files is located somewhere else than the package's root, you need to specify this. Set the `template_dir` input variable to the location of the template folder (contains a `publish.js` file).\n\nFor example, to use the JSDoc [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) template, set the `template` input variable to `ink-docstrap` and the `template_dir` to the string `template`.\n\n## JSDoc Configuration file \xf0\x9f\x93\x84\n\nTo use a JSDoc [configuration file](https://jsdoc.app/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) located in your repository, you will need to specify the path to the file in the `config_file` input variable. Normally, if you use the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout), this will just resolve to `conf.json` or `conf.js`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### GitHub Pages \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n\nAn example for deploying JSDoc generated documentation to GitHub Pages with [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#table-of-contents).\n\nThis jsdoc-action workflow configuration uses the [Minami](https://github.com/nijikokun/minami) JSDoc template and uses the root `README.md` file as the front page.\n\n```yml\nname: GitHub pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Build\n        uses: andstor/jsdoc-action@v1\n        with:\n          source_dir: ./src\n          output_dir: ./out\n          config_file: conf.json\n          template: minami\n          front_page: README.md\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n          publish_dir: ./out\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2020 [Andr\xc3\xa9 Storhaug](https://github.com/andstor)\n\nThe jsdoc-action GitHub action is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).  \nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/andstor/jsdoc-action/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more information.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
704,"b'# Slack API Action\nThis action wraps the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web) in an action to facilitate usage within workflows.\n\n## Setup\nThis actions performs it\'s actions using a slack bot token. To acquire one you need to create a Slack App, add the Bot token scope permissions required for the api calls you intend to perform and install it into your workspace. Once this is done the workspace token is available on the permissions page of your app and you can start using this action. \n\n## Usage\nSend a basic text message to a channel.\n```\n- name: Slack Message                     \n  uses: hbfernandes/slack-action@1.0\n  env:\n    SLACK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}   \n  with:\n    args: |\n      {\n        ""channel"": ""development"",\n        ""text"": ""testing slack messaging""\n      }\n```\n\nThe `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable must be present and have the necessary permissions for the method being used.\n\nBy default the api method is [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) but you can define any other method suported by the [`@slack/web-api`](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api) package provided by the [Node Slack SDK](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/).\n\n```\n- name: Slack Message                     \n  uses: hbfernandes/slack-action@1.0   \n  with:\n    method: conversations.list\n```\n\nThe args parameter expects a string in the JSON format with any parameter that the method accepts. This way any custom message formatting is allowed.\n\nA more complex message:\n```\n- name: Slack Message                     \n  uses: hbfernandes/slack-action@1.0   \n  with:\n    args: |\n      {\n        ""channel"": ""development"",\n        ""attachments"": [\n          {\n            ""mrkdwn_in"": [""text""],\n            ""color"": ""#36a64f"",\n            ""pretext"": ""Built branch ${{ github.ref }}"",\n            ""author_name"": ""${{ github.actor }}"",\n            ""author_link"": ""http://flickr.com/bobby/"",\n            ""author_icon"": ""https://placeimg.com/16/16/people"",\n            ""title"": ""${{ github.workflow }}"",\n            ""title_link"": ""https://api.slack.com/"",\n            ""text"": ""Optional `text` that appears within the attachment"",\n            ""thumb_url"": ""http://placekitten.com/g/200/200"",\n            ""footer"": ""Github Actions"",\n            ""footer_icon"": ""https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/default_application_icon.png"",\n            ""ts"": 123456789\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n```\n\n## Development\nTo build the action simply run:\n```\nnpm run package\n```\n\n## ToDo\nCustom predefined message formats might be added in the future if needed.

A ref can also be appended to specify an exact commit of the action (SHA, tag, or branch). Must be in the format of `{owner}/{repo}` or `{owner}/{repo}@{sha}`.\n\n### **`pal-action-directory`**\n\n**Optional** Directory containing the `action.yml` that you would like to execute in repo. If omitted, the root directory is assumed to be the location of `action.yml`.\n\n---\n\n## **Examples**\n\n## Example usage w/ pal-action-directory\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action\n    pal-action-directory: src/super-secret-nested-action\n```\n\n## Example usage w/ additional parameters\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action\n    # the following input gets passed to the private action\n    input-used-by-other-action: this will be passed to super-secret-action\n```\n\n## Example usage w/o additional parameters\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action\n```\n\n## Example usage w/ SHA\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action@b8a83a0\n```\n\n## Example usage w/ Branch\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action@master\n```\n\n## Example usage w/ Tag\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action@v1\n```\n\n## Example usage w/ Output\n\n```yaml\n- uses: nick-fields/private-action-loader@v3\n  id: output_example\n  with:\n    pal-repo-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}\n    pal-repo-name: some-org/super-secret-action@v1\n- name: Get the previous output\n  run: echo ""The previous output was ${{ steps.output_example.outputs.<name of output> }}""\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Limitations**\n\n- Only supports javascript actions\n\n## **Ownership**\n\nAs of 2022/02/15 ownership of this project has been transferred to my personal `nick-fields` account due to me leaving InVision. Previously on 2021/04/28 ownership of this project was transferred from the `InVisionApp` organization to my work account `nick-invision` due to changes to our organization level security settings that conflicts with public GitHub Actions.  I am the author and have been the primary maintainer since day one and will continue to maintain this as needed.  \n\nNo immediate action is required if you rely on this as GitHub handles ownership transfers pretty well. Any current workflow reference to `nick-invision/private-action-loader@<whatever>` will still work, but will just pull from `nick-fields/private-action-loader@<whatever>` instead.  Who knows how long that will work, so at some point it would be beneficial to update your workflows to reflect the new owner accordingly.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
706,"b'# get-gke-credentials\n\nThis action configures authentication to a [GKE cluster][gke] via a `kubeconfig` file that can be used with `kubectl` or other methods of interacting with the cluster.\n\nAuthentication is performed by generating a [short-lived token][token] (default behaviour) or via the [GCP auth plugin][gcp-auth-plugin] present in `kubectl` which uses the service account keyfile path in [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS][gcp-gcloud-auth].\n\n**This is not an officially supported Google product, and it is not covered by a\nGoogle Cloud support contract. To report bugs or request features in a Google\nCloud product, please contact [Google Cloud\nsupport](https://cloud.google.com/support).**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis action requires:\n\n-   Google Cloud credentials that are authorized to view a GKE cluster. See the\n    Authorization section below for more information. You also need to\n    [create a GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart).\n\n-   This action runs using Node 16. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions\n    runners, you must use runner version [2.285.0](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)\n    or newer.\n\n-   If you plan to create binaries, containers, pull requests, or other\n    releases, add the following to your .gitignore to prevent accidentially\n    committing the KUBECONFIG to your release artifact:\n\n    ```text\n    # Ignore generated kubeconfig from google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials\n    gha-kubeconfig-*\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job_id:\n    permissions:\n      contents: \'read\'\n      id-token: \'write\'\n\n    steps:\n    - id: \'auth\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/auth@v1\'\n      with:\n        workload_identity_provider: \'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider\'\n        service_account: \'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\'\n\n    - id: \'get-credentials\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n      with:\n        cluster_name: \'my-cluster\'\n        location: \'us-central1-a\'\n\n    # The KUBECONFIG env var is automatically exported and picked up by kubectl.\n    - id: \'get-pods\'\n      run: \'kubectl get pods\'\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\n-   `cluster_name` - (Required) Name of the cluster for which to get\n    credentials. If specified as a full resource name (e.g.\n    ""projects/p/locations/l/clusters/c""), then then ""project_id"" and ""location""\n    inputs are optional. If only specified as the name (e.g. ""my-cluster""), then\n    the ""project_id"" and ""location"" inputs may be required.\n\n-   `location` - (Optional) Location (e.g. region or zone) in which the cluster\n    resides. This value is required unless you specify ""cluster_name"" as a full\n    resource name.\n\n-   `project_id` - (Optional) Project ID where the cluster is deployed. If\n    provided, this will override the project configured by previous steps or\n    environment variables. If not provided, the project will be inferred,\n    best-effort.\n\n-   `use_auth_provider` - (Optional) If true, use the Google Cloud auth plugin in\n    kubectl instead of a short-lived access token. The default value is false.\n\n-   `use_internal_ip` - (Optional) If true, use the internal IP address for the\n    cluster endpoint. This is mostly used with private GKE clusters. The default\n    value is false.\n\n-   `use_connect_gateway` - (Optional) If true, uses the [Connect Gateway\n    endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/gateway)\n    to connect to the cluster. The default value is false.\n\n-   `fleet_membership_name` - (Optional) Fleet membership name of form\n    ""projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/memberships/MEMBERSHIP_NAME"" to use\n    for generating the Connect Gateway endpoint. This only applies if\n    ""use_connect_gateway"" is true. Defaults to auto discovery if empty.\n\n-   `quota_project_id` - (Optional) Project ID from which to pull quota. The\n    caller must have `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the project. If\n    unspecified, this defaults to the project of the authenticated principle.\n    This is an advanced setting, most users should leave this blank.\n\n## Outputs\n\n-   `kubeconfig_path` - Path on the local filesystem where the generated\n    KUBECONFIG file resides.\n\n-   Exports env var `KUBECONFIG` which is set to the generated `kubeconfig` file\n    path.\n\n## Authorization\n\nThere are a few ways to authenticate this action. A service account will be needed\nwith **at least** the following roles:\n\n- Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer (`roles/container.clusterViewer`)\n\nIf you are using the Connect Gateway, you must also have:\n\n-   GKE Hub Viewer (`roles/gkehub.viewer`)\n\n\n### Via google-github-actions/auth\n\nUse [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) to authenticate the action. You can use [Workload Identity Federation][wif] or traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] authentication.\nby specifying the `credentials` input. This Action supports both the recommended [Workload Identity Federation][wif] based authentication and the traditional [Service Account Key JSON][sa] based auth.\n\nSee [usage](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#usage) for more details.\n\n#### Authenticating via Workload Identity Federation\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job_id:\n    permissions:\n      contents: \'read\'\n      id-token: \'write\'\n\n    steps:\n    - id: \'auth\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/auth@v1\'\n      with:\n        workload_identity_provider: \'projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider\'\n        service_account: \'my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\'\n\n    - id: \'get-credentials\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n      with:\n        cluster_name: \'my-cluster\'\n        location: \'us-central1-a\'\n```\n\n#### Authenticating via Service Account Key JSON\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job_id:\n    steps:\n    - id: \'auth\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/auth@v1\'\n      with:\n        credentials_json: \'${{ secrets.gcp_credentials }}\'\n\n    - id: \'get-credentials\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n      with:\n        cluster_name: \'my-cluster\'\n        location: \'us-central1-a\'\n```\n\n### Via Application Default Credentials\n\nIf you are hosting your own runners, **and** those runners are on Google Cloud,\nyou can leverage the Application Default Credentials of the instance. This will\nauthenticate requests as the service account attached to the instance. **This\nonly works using a custom runner hosted on GCP.**\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job_id:\n    steps:\n    - id: \'get-credentials\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n      with:\n        cluster_name: \'my-cluster\'\n        location: \'us-central1-a\'\n```\n\nThe action will automatically detect and use the Application Default\nCredentials.\n\n## With Connect gateway\n\nYou can utilize the [Connect gateway][connect-gw] feature of [Fleets][fleets] with this action\nto connect to clusters without direct network connectivity. This can be useful for connecting to [private clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/private-cluster-concept)\nfrom GitHub hosted runners.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job_id:\n    steps:\n    - id: \'get-credentials\'\n      uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n      with:\n        cluster_name: \'my-private-cluster\'\n        location: \'us-central1-a\'\n        use_connect_gateway: \'true\'\n```\n\nFollow the [Connect gateway documentation][connect-gw] for initial setup.\nNote: The Connect Agent service account must have the correct [impersonation policy][connect-gw-impersonation] on the service account used to authenticate this action.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe recommend pinning to the latest available major version:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1\'\n```\n\nWhile this action attempts to follow semantic versioning, but we\'re ultimately\nhuman and sometimes make mistakes. To prevent accidental breaking changes, you\ncan also pin to a specific version:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: \'google-github-actions/get-gke-credentials@v1.0.0\'\n```\n\nHowever, you will not get automatic security updates or new features without\nexplicitly updating your version number. Note that we only publish `MAJOR` and\n`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions.

707,"b'# Label Actions\n\nLabel Actions is a GitHub bot that performs certain actions when issues,\npull requests or discussions are labeled or unlabeled.\n\n<img width=""800"" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dessant/label-actions/master/assets/screenshot.png"">\n\n## Supporting the Project\n\nThe continued development of Label Actions is made possible\nthanks to the support of awesome backers. If you\'d like to join them,\nplease consider contributing with\n[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=label-actions&src=repo),\n[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=label-actions&src=repo) or\n[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=label-actions&src=repo).\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe bot performs certain actions when an issue, pull request or discussion\nis labeled or unlabeled. No action is taken by default and the bot\nmust be configured. The following actions are supported:\n\n- Post comments\n- Add labels\n- Remove labels\n- Close threads\n- Reopen threads\n- Lock threads\n- Unlock threads\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Create the `.github/workflows/label-actions.yml` workflow file,\n   use one of the [example workflows](#examples) to get started\n2. Create the `.github/label-actions.yml` configuration file\n   based on the [example](#configuring-labels-and-actions) below\n3. Start labeling issues, pull requests and discussions\n\n### Inputs\n\nThe bot can be configured using [input parameters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n- **`github-token`**\n  - GitHub access token, value must be `${{ github.token }}` or an encrypted\n    secret that contains a [personal access token](#using-a-personal-access-token)\n  - Optional, defaults to `${{ github.token }}`\n- **`config-path`**\n  - Configuration file path\n  - Optional, defaults to `.github/label-actions.yml`\n- **`process-only`**\n  - Process label events only for issues, pull requests or discussions,\n    value must be a comma separated list, list items must be\n    one of `issues`, `prs` or `discussions`\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n\n### Configuration\n\nLabels and actions are specified in a configuration file.\nActions are grouped under label names, and a label name can be prepended\nwith a `-` sign to declare actions taken when a label is removed\nfrom a thread. Actions can be overridden or declared only for issues,\npull requests or discussions by grouping them under the\n`issues`, `prs` or `discussions` key.\n\n#### Actions\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n- **`comment`**\n  - Post comments, value must be either a comment or a list of comments,\n    `{issue-author}` is an optional placeholder\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n- **`label`**\n  - Add labels, value must be either a label or a list of labels\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n- **`unlabel`**\n  - Remove labels, value must be either a label or a list of labels\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n- **`close`**\n  - Close threads, value must be either `true` or `false`\n  - Optional, defaults to `false`\n- **`close-reason`**\n  - Reason for closing threads, value must be:\n    - `completed` or `not planned` for issues\n    - `duplicate`, `outdated` or `resolved` for discussions\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n- **`reopen`**\n  - Reopen threads, value must be either `true` or `false`\n  - Optional, defaults to `false`\n- **`lock`**\n  - Lock threads, value must be either `true` or `false`\n  - Optional, defaults to `false`\n- **`lock-reason`**\n  - Reason for locking threads, value must be one\n    of `resolved`, `off-topic`, `too heated` or `spam`,\n    ignored for discussions\n  - Optional, defaults to `\'\'`\n- **`unlock`**\n  - Unlock threads, value must be either `true` or `false`\n  - Optional, defaults to `false`\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following workflow will perform the actions specified\nin the `.github/label-actions.yml` configuration file when an issue,\npull request or discussion is labeled or unlabeled.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```yaml\nname: \'Label Actions\'\n\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [labeled, unlabeled]\n  pull_request_target:\n    types: [labeled, unlabeled]\n  discussion:\n    types: [labeled, unlabeled]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  issues: write\n  pull-requests: write\n  discussions: write\n\njobs:\n  action:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: dessant/label-actions@v3\n```\n\n### Available input parameters\n\nThis workflow declares all the available input parameters of the app\nand their default values.

I could create a dedicated CI\njob to run the `fastlane supply` action with the `validate_only` option.\nHowever,to run this job on PRs, I would need to expose a service account key for\naccessing the Google Play Developer API. Needless to say that it would be a\nsecurity flaw.\n\nThis action uses a docker image built using a simple validation logic written in\nGo. It validates the Fastlane metadata for Android against the constraints\nenforced by Google Play.\n\n[noice]: https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/noice\n\n## Usage\n\n_See [v1 README][v1-readme] if you\'re using v1._\n\n[v1-readme]: https://github.com/ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata/blob/v1/README.md\n\n```yaml\non: [pull_request]\njobs:\n  # required to run on Linux because this is a docker container action\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: ashutoshgngwr/validate-fastlane-supply-metadata@v2\n      with:\n        fastlaneDir: ./android-metadata # optional\n        usePlayStoreLocales: true # optional\n```\n\n| Option                | Description                                                                                                            |            Default            |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------: |\n| `fastlaneDir`         | Directory where Fastlane Android metadata is located.

See how this is done at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/issue_template.md).\n\nFor our example, we will use the following:\n\n```\n## Required Information\n\nEntering this information will route you directly to the right team and expedite traction.\n\n**Question, Bug, or Feature?**  \n*Type*: here\n\nShould this get assigned to @damccorm?\n**Assign to damccorm**: replace this with yes or no\n\n## Issue Description\n\nDescribe your issue here\n```\n\nNext, set up a .yml file `issue-rules.yml` with rules in your repository. These rules should correspond to your issue template. See an example of how [Microsoft does this](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/issue-rules.yml).\n\nThe basic formatting of this yml file should be as follows:\n\n```\n# list of primary rules\nrules:\n- valueFor: \'*Type*\' # If user specifies ""*Type*: Question"" above, it will get labeled with ""question"" and ""plz help""\n  contains: Question\n  addLabels: [\'question\', \'plz help\']\n- valueFor: \'*Type*\'\n  contains: Bug\n  addLabels: [\'bug\']\n- valueFor: \'*Type*\'\n  contains: Feature\n  addLabels: [\'enhancement\']\n- valueFor: \'**Assign to damccorm**\' # If user specifies ""**Assign to damccorm**: yes"", it will get labeled with ""damccorms problem now"" and assigned to ""@damccorm""\n  contains: yes\n  addLabels: [\'damccorms problem now\']\n  assign: [\'damccorm\']\n\n# List of secondary rules to run if no matches detected in primary rules\nnomatches:\n- contains: \'this should get assigned to damccorm\' # Checks the entire issue for a substring match. If one is found, adds labels ""damccorms problem now"" and ""maybe?"", and assigns to ""@damccorm""\n  addLabels: [\'damccorms problem now\', \'maybe?\']\n  assign: [\'damccorm\']\n\n# List that always runs after rules and nomatches. Look for missing sets of tags here.\ntags:\n- noneIn: [\'bug\', \'enhancement\', \'question\'] # If no bug, enhancement, or question labels are added, label with \'triage\'\n  addLabels: [\'triage\']\n```\n\nFinally, setup your action workflow to run this action. Try out our routing (using this example) by opening up an issue in this repo!\n\n```\n- uses: actions/checkout@v1\n- uses: damccorm/tag-ur-it@master\nwith:\n   repo-token: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n   configuration-path: ""path/to/issue-rules.yml""\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have suggestions for how tag-ur-it could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue!

719,"b'# Accelerate builds using buildcache\n\nUse this GitHub Action to accelerate compilation in your GitHub workflows using [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache)\n\n![Compilation Improvement Example](./docs/Buildcache_Example_Improvement.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Workflow integration\n1. Build integration\n1. ??\n1. Profit\n\n### Workflow Integration\n\n#### Default Style\n\nThe defaults fit most projects well.\n\nThe defaults definitely fit react-native projects well.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  ios:\n  runs-on: macos-latest # also runs on ubuntu and windows\n  steps:\n    - uses: mikehardy/buildcache-action@v2\n```\n\n- 500MB cache, cache is in `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, just needs build integration and you\'re set!\n\nWhen using with `actions/checkout@v2`, add this action as a step after the checkout, or the `buildcache` binary will be clobbered in the post-job cleanup of the checkout action:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: mikehardy/buildcache-action@v2\n```\n#### Customize if you need to\n\nAll [buildcache options](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache/blob/master/doc/configuration.md) are available to override via environment variables set in the workflow env area\n\nA few options are used internally by this action, but if you override them this action will respect the override you have set.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  ios:\n    env: # overrides: https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache/blob/master/doc/configuration.md\n      BUILDCACHE_DIR: ../.buildcache # optional: Put the cache somewhere else\n      BUILDCACHE_DEBUG: 2 # optional: If you need more logging?\n      BUILDCACHE_MAX_CACHE_SIZE: 1000000000 # optional: Need a bigger cache?\n      BUILDCACHE_LOG_FILE: ../buildcache.log # optional: Log where you like\n  runs-on: macos-latest\n  steps:\n    - uses: mikehardy/buildcache-action@v1\n      with:\n        cache_key: ${{ matrix.os }} # optional: separate caches maybe?\n        upload_buildcache_log: \'true\' # optional: 100% cache misses? Find out why\n        zero_buildcache_stats: \'false\' # optional: lifetime vs per-run stats?\n```\n\n### Build Integration\n\nbuildcache is available now, but is unused until you call `clang` and`clang++` wrapped by buildcache.\n\nXcode puts `clang` and `clang++` on your `PATH` (in `/usr/bin`), and this action puts buildcache wrappers for it in your `PATH` first, before the normal Xcode ones.\n\nThis `PATH` manipulation is the key to an easy build integration.\n\nYou may rely on calling `clang` and `clang++` from `PATH` at all times, instead of via fully-specified paths. In environments where buildcache is availble, it will work. In environments that do not have buildcache, _it will still work_\n\n#### Minimal change: override compiler on command line\n\nIf you want to isolate the integration to the Github Actions CI environment, run your Xcode build using specific overrides.\n\n```sh\nxcodebuild CC=clang CPLUSPLUS=clang++ LD=clang LDPLUSPLUS=clang++ <all other parameters>`\n```\n\nHere is [a real example of a project integrating it](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera/pull/131/files) this way\n\n#### Maximum change: allow buildcache use everywhere\n\nAfter seeing the acceleration, you may want to use buildcache locally as well (I do!)\n\nThis is possible if you change your project definition to override the compiler to use the value from `PATH` all the time. This should be backwards-compatible - it should still work on machines that do not have buildcache installed, but it is more intrusive because it changes your Xcode project file.\n\nYou can may do this via a `Podfile` hook like this:\n\n```ruby\n    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\n      target.build_configurations.each do |config|\n        config.build_settings[""CC""] = ""clang""\n        config.build_settings[""LD""] = ""clang""\n        config.build_settings[""CXX""] = ""clang++""\n        config.build_settings[""LDPLUSPLUS""] = ""clang++""\n      end\n    end\n\n```\n\n## Verification\n\nHow do you know it is working?\n\nThe overall buid time should make it obvious, but the real test is your cache hit/miss rate.\n\nTo verify things are working using the default configuration, look at the output of the workflow run, expand the ""Post buildcache"" step and check the statistics printed out. If you you ""Re-run jobs"" using the GitHub Actions web interface to re-run a job a second time, you _should_ see 100% hit rate, on quite a few objects.\n\nThe output of this repositories [react-native compile test action](https://github.com/mikehardy/buildcache-action/actions/workflows/react-native-build-test.yml) are a good example.\n\nIf you need more information, the default `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG` level of `2` is likely enough, you just need to add the `upload_buildcache_log` flag to your workflow integration and set it to `true`, then you may examine the actual output of buildcache as it worked, using the logfile attached as an artifact to the workflow run. If that still is not enough you may need a debug level of `1` See [Debugging Buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#debugging) for more information.\n\nIn practice, that is all I have needed to do to be certain the integration was successful in other projects.\n\n## Benchmarks - 40-50% improvement\n\niOS compile performance improvements of approximately 40-50% may be expected when using this action\n\n- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native-firebase app with all modules: 5min 52s (vs 10min)\n- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native 0.64 demo app without Flipper: 2min 55s (vs 5min 20s)\n- macos-latest, warm cache, react-native-vision-camera: [7min 13s (vs 13min 13s)](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/pull/131#issuecomment-832687144)\n\nThe _first_ build - the ""cold"" cache case - will be slower by around 15%, since buildcache has overhead to determine if it can use the cached object or not. On the cache miss case it then delegates to the compiler and stores the object for the next run which takes longer than a normal compile call.\n\nIf you experience low cache hit rates on a project with a largely static codebase (i.e., one that should be very cacheable and 2 runs with nearly no changes do not cache for some reason), you should definitely increase the debugging level for the buildcache log and examine stats output before and after each run. A common and easy fix may be as simple as increasing your cache size.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Approach\n\nThis action does these things - if they interact poorly with your project, perhaps they could be altered slightly and made to work better if you propose a PR:\n\n- fetches the latest version of [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache)\n- installs it in your project directory as `buiildcache/bin/buildcache`\n- makes symoblic links from `buildcache` to `clang` and `clang++`\n- adds that directory to your `$GITHUB_PATH` for future steps\n- configures the cache directory (defaults to `.buildcache` in your project directory if not set via environment variable)\n- configures buildcache storage limit (defaults to 500MB if not set via environment variable)\n- restores previous caches, and at the end saves the current one\n- turns on `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG=2` if not set in environment variable\n- will upload debug log if `BUILDCACHE_DEBUG` is not -1 and if `upload_buildcache_log` is true\n- zeros cache stats by default after restore, so you get clean stats per-run, `zero_buildcache_stats` can disable it\n\n### Things that don\'t work\n\n- Direct mode did not work in testing when compiling react-native apps. Dependency files aren\'t created, but are needed. Direct mode is not enabled.\n- `ccache` did not work when compiling react-native apps. It can\'t handle ""multiple source files"" so cache misses all the time.\n- copying `buildcache` to `clang` and `clang++`, it has to be symbolic links. This means this is not quite a drop-in replacement on windows\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you set up a personal access token on GitHub, then export it as well as a couple other items, the whole thing runs well from a local mac for development.\n\n```bash\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN=PERSONALACCESSTOKENHERE\n```\n\nI usually have two terminals open side by side, one with `yarn build-watch` and one to run `yarn test`\n\nPRs are welcome. This action is new and is in the ""works for me"" and ""works for react-native-firebase"" state, so it _is_ useful, but maybe not generic enough to be useful for others yet.\n\n## Inspiration + Gratitude\n\nI work on [react-native-firebase](https://rnfirebase.io) and [FlutterFire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/) for [Invertase](https://invertase.io) and they have a truly inspiring dedication to automated testing. I sincerely love it, but...CI is slow for iOS testing!\n\nI was inspired to try iOS compile acceleration after seeing [Codified](https://getcodified.com/services/) applying ccache with 10-20% improvements to CI Xcode builds, but it wasn\'t packaged up or redistributable\n\nI then found [ccache-action](https://github.com/hendrikmuhs/ccache-action) - Henrik has done a great job there! Unfortunately in my testing with react-native projets ccache did not speed things up much because ccache misses cache on ""multiple_source_files"" compile calls, and that is seemingly all react-native projects do. `ccache-action` was the inspiration for this action though, thanks Hendrik!\n\nThen I found [buildcache](https://github.com/mbitsnbites/buildcache) and saw with a quick test I could achieve nearly 50% performance improvements\n\nCombining the motivation to try it, the template of the idea already existing with ccache, and the good performance of buildcache and here we are.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This precludes adding comments when your PRs are coming from forks, which is the norm for open source projects. To work around this situation I\'ve created a simple companion app you can deploy to Cloud Run or another host to proxy the create comment requests with a personal access token you provide.\n\nSee this issue: https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/4 for more details.\n\nCheck out the proxy service here: https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment-proxy\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        with:\n          message: |\n            **Howdie!**\n          proxy-url: https://add-pr-comment-proxy-94idvmwyie-uc.a.run.app\n```\n\n### Status Message Overrides\n\nYou can override your messages based on your job status. This can be helpful\nif you don\'t anticipate having the data required to create a helpful message in\ncase of failure, but you still want a message to be sent to the PR comment.\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          message: |\n            **Howdie!**\n          message-failure: |\n            Uh oh!\n```\n\n### Multiple Message Files\n\nInstead of directly setting the message you can also load a file with the text\nof your message using `message-path`. `message-path` supports loading multiple\nfiles and files on multiple lines, the contents of which will be concatenated.\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          message-path: |\n            message-part-*.txt\n```\n\n### Find-and-Replace\n\nPatterns can be matched and replaced to update comments. This could be useful\nfor some situations, for instance, updating a checklist comment.\n\nFind is a regular expression passed to the [RegExp() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/RegExp). You can also\ninclude modifiers to override the default `gi`.\n\n**Example**\n\nOriginal message:\n\n```\n[ ] Hello\n[ ] World\n```\n\nAction:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          find: |\n            \\n\\\\[ \\\\]\n          replace: |\n            [X]\n```\n\nFinal message:\n\n```\n[X] Hello\n[X] World\n```\n\nMultiple find and replaces can be used:\n\n**Example**\n\nOriginal message:\n\n```\nhello world!\n```\n\nAction:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          find: |\n            hello\n            world\n          replace: |\n            goodnight\n            moon\n```\n\nFinal message:\n\n```\ngoodnight moon!\n```\n\nIt defaults to your resolved message (either from `message` or `message-path`) to\ndo a replacement:\n\n**Example**\n\nOriginal message:\n\n```\nhello\n\n<< FILE_CONTENTS >>\n\nworld\n```\n\nAction:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          message-path: |\n            message.txt\n          find: |\n            << FILE_CONTENTS >>\n```\n\nFinal message:\n\n```\nhello\n\nsecret message from message.txt\n\nworld\n```\n\n### Bring your own issues\n\nYou can set an issue id explicitly. Helpful for cases where you want to post\nto an issue but for some reason the event would not allow the id to be determined.\n\n**Example**\n\n> In this case `add-pr-comment` should have no problem finding the issue number\n> on its own, but for demonstration purposes.\n\n```yaml\non:\n  deployment_status:\n\njobs:\n  pr:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - id: pr\n        run: |\n          issue=$(gh pr list --search ""${{ github.sha }}"" --state open --json number --jq "".[0].number"")\n          echo ""issue=$issue"" >>$GITHUB_OUTPUT\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2\n        with:\n          issue: ${{ steps.pr.outputs.issue }}\n          message: |\n            **Howdie!**\n```\n\n## Contributors \xe2\x9c\xa8\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""https://app.lizardbyte.dev""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42013603?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""ReenigneArcher""/><br /><sub><b>ReenigneArcher</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=ReenigneArcher"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""https://github.com/aryella-lacerda""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28730324?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""Aryella Lacerda""/><br /><sub><b>Aryella Lacerda</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=aryella-lacerda"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""https://github.com/vincent-joignie-dd""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103102299?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""vincent-joignie-dd""/><br /><sub><b>vincent-joignie-dd</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=vincent-joignie-dd"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""https://ahanoff.dev""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2371703?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""Akhan Zhakiyanov""/><br /><sub><b>Akhan Zhakiyanov</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=ahanoff"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""https://github.com/ahatzz11""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6256032?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""Alex Hatzenbuhler""/><br /><sub><b>Alex Hatzenbuhler</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=ahatzz11"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n      <td align=""center"" valign=""top"" width=""14.28%""><a href=""http://www.august8.net""><img src=""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/766820?v=4?s=100"" width=""100px;"" alt=""Tommy Wang""/><br /><sub><b>Tommy Wang</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/commits?author=twang817"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-restore -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

724,"b'# Slack - Github Action \n\nA Github Action that sends custom Slack notifications by use of templates.\n\n![](https://github.com/keithalpichi/slack-action/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)\n![](https://github.com/keithalpichi/slack-action/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)\n![](https://github.com/keithalpichi/slack-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)\n\n## Examples of Some Templates\n### `push1`\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14797743/111272704-33a48f80-85f0-11eb-917c-6eb40c2dc473.png)\n### `steps1`\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14797743/112259892-48070e80-8c26-11eb-8642-88b7a953dbf8.png)\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. Create an [Incoming Webhook](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) in your Slack workspace. Copy the webhook URL, you\'ll need it in the next step.\n1. Create a [Github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in the settings tab in a repository, or organization if you want it to be used across all repositories within an organization. Give it the name ""SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"" and value as the webhook URL.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Add ""SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"" as an [`env`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env) to every workflow file you want to use this action in.\n    ```\n    env:\n      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}\n    ```\n1. Add this action as a step and make sure to replace `x.y.z.` with a valid [release version](https://github.com/keithalpichi/slack-action/releases):\n    ```\n    - name: Send Slack Notification\n      uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n    ```\n1. Add your desired inputs from the input section below to the step.\n\n## Github Action Inputs\n\nBelow are required inputs.\n\n| input | short description |\n| - | - |\n| [`template`](#template) | The template ID that identifies the template to use for the Slack notification message.

You can use the following templates: \n\n- `plain1`- a template for plain messages that displays a custom description.\n- `plain2`- a template for plain messages that displays the link to the current Github Action run.\n- `push1`- a template for a message with push event details such as git commit hash, run ID & #, branch, status and more provided in a two-column table.\n- `steps1`- a template for a message that summarizes the statuses of all the steps in the job. Each summary includes an emoji, the step identifier, and the status of the step. \n\nSee the [Templates](#templates) section below for images and details of each template.\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain2\n```\n### `title`\n\nThe title to display on the Slack notification message. If this is not provided, ""Github Action"" is used.\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain2\n    title: Success\n```\n\n### `description`\n\nThe description to display on the Slack notification message.\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain1\n    description: Everything looks good!\n```\n\n\n### `status`\n\nThe current status of the job to use within the template. Usage of this input depends on the `template` input provided. If you\'d like for Github to report the current status of the job use [`${{ job.status }}`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-context). Possible status values reported by Github are success, failure, or cancelled. You may also choose to provide any string value.\n\n#### Example usage\nUsing the `job.status` context:\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    status: ${{ job.status }}\n    template: plain2\n```\nProviding a custom status:\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    status: all green\n    template: plain2\n```\n\n### `channel`\n\nOverrides the default channel or user to send the Slack message to.\n- If a channel is provided it must be a valid channel that starts with \'#\'\n- If a user is provided it must be a valid user that starts with \'@\'\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain1\n    channel: #pets\n```\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain1\n    channel: @octocat\n```\n\n### `username`\n\nOverrides the default username of the message. This is the name specified as the sender of the message.\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain2\n    username: Al\n```\n\n### `icon_emoji`\n\nOverrides the default emoji to use as the icon for this message. Overrides `icon_url` if they\'re both provided. Find an appropriate emoji from this [source](https://unicodey.com/emoji-data/table.htm). Ensure the emoji starts and ends with a colon. \n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain2\n    icon_emoji: "":fire:""\n```\n\n### `icon_url`\n\nOverrides the default public URL to an image to use as the icon for this message. This will be overridden by `icon_emoji` if they\'re both provided.\n\n#### Example usage\n```\n- name: Send Slack Notification\n  uses: keithalpichi/slack-action@x.y.z\n  with:\n    template: plain2\n    icon_url: https://octodex.github.com/images/original.png\n```\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using [Github Action status check functions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions) to conditionally run this Github Action\nThis is useful if you want to run this Github Action only when a certain status exists:\n```\nsteps:\n  ...\n  - name: Always notify Slack no matter what happens\n    if: ${{ always() }}\n```\n```\nsteps:\n  ...\n  - name: Only notify Slack when it is successful\n    if: ${{ success() }}\n```\n```\nsteps:\n  ...\n  - name: Only notify Slack when there is a failure\n    if: ${{ failure() }}\n```\n\n## Templates\n\n### `plain1`\nA message with a text description and default title. This template uses the following inputs:\n- description (required)- the description in the message\n- title - if provided overrides the default title ""Github Action"" \n- channel- if provided overrides the default channel assigned to the Slack Incoming Webhook\n```\nwith:\n  template: plain1\n  description: We\'re all green!\n```\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14797743/110732183-80472f80-81d8-11eb-96d3-a37404c09b33.png)\n\n### `plain2`\nA message with a link to the Github Action run and default title.

The link to the workflow run is provided in the ""Run Number"" cell. This template uses the following inputs:\n- status (required)- the status to put into the ""Status"" cell (see image below)\n- title - if provided, overrides the default title ""Github Action"" \n- description- if provided, inserts the description below the title\n- channel- if provided, overrides the default channel assigned to the Slack Incoming Webhook\n\n```\nwith:\n  template: push1\n  description: optional description\n  status: ${{ job.status }}\n```\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14797743/111272704-33a48f80-85f0-11eb-917c-6eb40c2dc473.png)\n\n### `steps1`\n\nA message that summarizes the statuses of all the steps in the job. Each summary includes an emoji, the step identifier, and the status of the step. This template uses the following inputs:\n- steps (required)- the [`steps` Github Action context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#steps-context). It\'s as simple as providing `${{ toJSON(steps) }}` to this step.\n- title - if provided, overrides the default title ""Github Action"" \n- description- if provided, inserts the description below the title\n- channel- if provided, overrides the default channel assigned to the Slack Incoming Webhook\n\n```\nwith:\n  template: steps1\n  description: optional description\n  title: optional Title\n  status: ${{ toJSON(steps) }}\n```\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14797743/112259892-48070e80-8c26-11eb-8642-88b7a953dbf8.png)'","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

You also must create a Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line), which should be stored as a secret in your Github repository.\n\nHere is an example of a Github workflow file that uses this action to trigger a `sample-push` event in another repository:\n\n```yaml\nname: Alert parent repository on push\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Dispatch to `other-repo`\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Emit repository_dispatch\n        uses: mvasigh/dispatch-action@main\n        with:\n          # You should create a personal access token and store it in your repository\n          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n          repo: other-repo\n          owner: mvasigh\n          event_type: sample_push\n```\n\nThe emitted event can be consumed in another Github workflow, either within the same repository or another one. Here\'s an example:\n\n```yaml\nname: Print on external push\n\n# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on repository_dispatch and filters by type of event (i.e. `event_type`)\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [sample_push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Run a one-line script\n        run: echo Hello, world!\n      - name: Run a multi-line script\n        run: |\n          echo Add other custom actions to build,\n          echo test, and deploy your project.\n```\n\nBy default, this action will hydrate the `client_payload` of the repository dispatch event with the original event payload under the `event` key (equivalent to `github.context.payload`). You can also send any additional data by supplying the `message` input option, which will also be available under the `message` key of the `client_payload` object. This can be used in other workflows by accessing `${{ github.event.client_payload.message }}` in any workflow triggered by this action.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```yaml\n# Dispatcher workflow in submodule\nsteps:\n  - name: Dispatch submodule_push event\n    uses: mvasigh/dispatch-action@main\n    with:\n      token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n      repo: \'@\'\n      event_type: submodule_push\n      message: |\n        {\n          ""foo"": ""bar""\n        }\n```\n\n```yaml\n# Consuming workflow in parent repository\nsteps:\n  - name: Print custom message\n    run: echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.message.foo }} # bar\n```\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d Options\n\nThis action accepts the following options:\n\n`token` **(required)** - a Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with the `repo` scope enabled (if using with private repositories) or `public_repo` (for use only with public repositories)\n\n`event_type` **(required)** - a name for the type of event that you are emitting\n\n`repo` - name of the repository to dispatch event to (same repository by default)\n\n`owner` - Github org/name of the repository\'s owner (event sender\'s name by default)\n\n`message` - optional data to send along with the event (must be a JSON string)\n\n## Author\n\n\xf0\x9f\x91\xa4 **Mehdi Vasigh <mehdi.vasigh@gmail.com>**\n\n- Website: https://mvasigh.dev/\n- Twitter: [@mehdi_vasigh](https://twitter.com/mehdi_vasigh)\n- Github: [@mvasigh](https://github.com/mvasigh)\n\n## Show your support\n\nGive a \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f if this project helped you!\n\n---\n\n_This README was generated with \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f by [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator)_\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
