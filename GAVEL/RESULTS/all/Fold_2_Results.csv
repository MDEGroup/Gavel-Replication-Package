243,"b'# Collect Docker Logs\n\n[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)\n\nThis is a GitHub Action which will collect logs from all running docker\ncontainers. Logs can either be dumped to stdout, or can be written to a\nfolder (where you can tar them up and\n[upload them as an artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)).\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `dest` - Destination folder to write to. If not provided, logs will be\n  written to stdout. If provided, the folder will be created if it doesn\'t\n  exist, and files will be written based on container names (e.g. \'redis.log\').\n\n- `images` - A comma delimited list of image names. If provided, only output\n  from containers with these images will be shown. Containers will match if\n  the image matches exactly (e.g. ""mongo:3.4.22"") or if the image name matches\n  without a tag (e.g. ""mongo"" will match ""mongo:3.4.22"").\n\n- `tail` - Max number of lines to show from each container.  Defaults to ""all"".\n\n- `shell` - Shell to execute commands.  Defaults to ""/bin/sh"".\n\n## Usage\n\n## Dump all logs on a failure\n\n```yaml\n- name: Dump docker logs on failure\n  if: failure()\n  uses: jwalton/gh-docker-logs@v2\n```\n\n## Dump redis and mongodb logs\n\n```yaml\n- name: Dump redis logs\n  uses: jwalton/gh-docker-logs@v2\n  with:\n    images: \'redis,mongo\'\n    # Only show last 100 lines of each\n    tail: \'100\'\n```\n\n## Upload tarball as artifact\n\n```yaml\n- name: Collect docker logs on failure\n  if: failure()\n  uses: jwalton/gh-docker-logs@v2\n  with:\n    dest: \'./logs\'\n- name: Tar logs\n  if: failure()\n  run: tar cvzf ./logs.tgz ./logs\n- name: Upload logs to GitHub\n  if: failure()\n  uses: actions/upload-artifact@master\n  with:\n    name: logs.tgz\n    path: ./logs.tgz\n```\n\n## Dump all logs on a failure using different shell\n\n```yaml\n- name: Dump docker logs on failure using different shell\n  if: failure()\n  uses: jwalton/gh-docker-logs@v2\n  with:\n    shell: \'/bin/sh\'\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

An active fork is available at https://github.com/pulumi/action-docker-build, which should be used instead.**\n\n\n# Docker Image Builder for GitHub Actions\n\nThis repository contains a GitHub Action to build, tag and push a Docker image based on a `Dockerfile`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe inputs to the action are documented below. At least one of `tag-latest`, `tag-snapshot` or `additional-tags` must be\nspecified, or the action will fail. Generally, pull requests and pushes to `master` should be built with `tag-snapshot`\nenabled, and release tags should be built with `tag-latest` enabled.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: jen20/action-docker-build@v1\n  with:\n      # Required. The name of the Docker repository to push to.\n      repository: jen20/test-action-docker-build\n      # Required. The username with which to authenticate with the\n      # specified Docker registry.\n      username: jen20\n      # Required. The password with which to authenticate with the\n      # specified Docker registry. It is strongly recommended that\n      # this value be considered a secret.\n      password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}\n      # Optional. The path to the Dockerfile relative to the root\n      # of the repository. Defaults to ""Dockerfile"".\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n      # Optional. The URL of the Docker registry to which to push.\n      # Uses the Docker CLI default if unset.\n      registry: https://customregistry.example.com/v2\n      # Optional. Whether or not to apply the `latest` tag to the\n      # built image, and push it to the registry. Defaults to false.\n      tag-latest: true\n      # Optional. Whether or not to apply a `snapshot` tag to the\n      # built image, and push it to the registry. Snapshot tags consist\n      # of the build date (in `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format) and the short\n      # commit hash of the source material. Defaults to false.\n      tag-snapshot: true\n      # Optional. A list of additional tags to apply to the image, and\n      # push to the registry. Tags must be listed in a comma-separated\n      # fashion.\n      additional-tags: firstadditionaltag, secondadditionaltag\n```\n\n## Notes on Docker Credentials\n\nThe action uses `docker login` in order to authenticate with a registry. Sadly none of Docker\'s credential helpers seem\nto work with GitHub actions (citing a lack of X11 support for `secretservice`, and ""inappropriate ioctl for device"" when\ninitializing a GPG key for use with `pass`). Consequently, the login falls back to storing the credentials as base-64\nencoded strings in a configuration directory with a warning emitted showing the path.\n\nPull requests to use a credentials helper are welcomed!\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

246,"b""# Log in to a container registry\r\nUse this GitHub Action to [log in to a private container registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/). Once login is done, the next set of actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n  with:\r\n    login-server: '<login server>' # default: index.docker.io\r\n    username: '<username>'\r\n    password: '<password>'\r\n```\r\nRefer to the action metadata file for details about all the inputs: [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login/blob/master/action.yml)\r\n\r\nWhen using the docker-login action, ensure your login-server matches the fully qualified path to your image. You should omit login-server if you are pushing to the default docker hub without a host prefix, for instance, `docker push repo/image`. You'll need to specify a login-server if you are using the fully qualified path: `docker push index.docker.io/repo/image`. \r\n\r\n## Logging in to multiple registries\r\nTo log in to multiple registries, simply run this action several times with different credentials; they will accumulate.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n  with:\r\n    login-server: contoso.azurecr.io\r\n    username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}\r\n    password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}\r\n- uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n  with:\r\n    login-server: index.docker.io\r\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERIO_USERNAME }}\r\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERIO_PASSWORD }}\r\n- run: |\r\n    docker pull contoso.azurecr.io/private/image:latest\r\n    docker pull private/image:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## You can build and push container registry by using the following example\r\n```yaml\r\n- uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n  with:\r\n    login-server: contoso.azurecr.io\r\n    username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}\r\n    password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}\r\n\r\n- run: |\r\n    docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}\r\n    docker push contoso.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite\r\nGet the username and password of your container registry and create secrets for them. For Azure Container registry refer to **admin [account document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account)** for username and password.\r\n\r\nNow add the username and password as [a secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/) in the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

In the example below we are checking out our repository code, and then running the `trilom/file-changes-action@v1` action.  The only thing you need to provide is a GITHUB_TOKEN so that Octokit can make it's API calls.\n\nIf a PR is made then it will look at all of the files included in the PR.\nIf a push is made then it will compare commits from the SHA `github.payload.before` to the SHA `github.payload.after` of the push.\n\nAfter gathering this information it will output the files in 2 ways.  \n  \n- As an output variable, you can use this variable by using `steps.file_changes_outputs_files`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_modified`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_added`, `steps.file_changes.outputs.files_removed`.\n\n- As a file on the container stored at `$HOME/files.json`, `$HOME/files_modified.json`, `$HOME/files_added.json`, `$HOME/files_removed.json`.  \n\n- _NOTE:_ If you set a custom delimiter in output or fileOutput inputs then you will receive different files.  For example a delimiter of ',' will output at `$HOME/files.csv` instead of `$HOME/files.json`.  Likewise, anything other than 'json' or ',' delmiters will output `$HOME/files.txt` files instead of `$HOME/files.json` by default.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nI have a process where I have AWS Cloudformation templates stored in one directory that might be named PRODUCT-ROLE, and mappings for these templates that span the PRODUCT.  For example **mappings/wordpress.mappings.yml, templates/wordpress-database.yml, templates/wordpress-webserver.yml**, and some of the templates might use different Lambda functions defined in for example **functions/wordpress-webserver/**.\n\nIn the example below we have a workflow that on *push* to the develop branch we can perform some actions based on the files.  In my use case I look for changes on the develop branch of this repository for every push that happens.  When a push happens and a change is made to any of the paths below the workflow will trigger.  With this action you are able to know exactly which files changed so that you can make decisions later in your CI/CD.\n\nIn this case, if a **templates/*.yml** file is changed, then we want to update the Cloudformation stack.  We can also write specifics for related templates.  For example, if **templates/wordpress-database.yml** changes then we want to deploy **templates/wordpress-webserver.yml** as well after.\n\nAnother case is if the **mappings/wordpress.mappings.yml** changes, we want to deploy all **template/wordpress-*.yml** files.\n\n## More examples  \n\n```yaml\nname: push-develop\non: [push]\njobs:\n  changes:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - id: file_changes\n        uses: trilom/file-changes-action@v1.2.3\n      - name: test\n        run: |\n          cat $HOME/files.json\n          cat $HOME/files_modified.json\n          cat $HOME/files_added.json\n          cat $HOME/files_removed.json\n          echo '${{ steps.file_changes.outputs.files}}'\n          echo '${{ steps.file_changes.outputs.files_modified}}'\n          echo '${{ steps.file_changes.outputs.files_added}}'\n          echo '${{ steps.file_changes.outputs.files_removed}}'\n```\n\nYou can set the output and fileOutput to ',' for csv output.\n\n```yaml\nname: push-develop\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - id: file_changes\n        uses: trilom/file-changes-action@v1.2.3\n        with:\n          output: ','\n          fileOutput: ','\n      - name: test\n        run: |\n          cat $HOME/files.csv\n```\n\nYou can set the output and fileOutput to ' ' for txt output.

For example:\n\n```yaml\n  defaults:\n    run:\n      shell: msys2 {0}\n  steps:\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n      install: >-\n        curl\n        git\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n```\n\n### Build matrix\n\nIt is common to test some package/tool on multiple environments, which typically requires installing different sets of\npackages through option `install`.\nGitHub Actions\' `strategy` and `matrix` fields allow to do so, as explained in [docs.github.com: Configuring a build matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix)\nand [docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix).\nSee, for instance:\n\n```yml\n  strategy:\n    matrix:\n      include:\n        - { sys: mingw64, env: x86_64 }\n        - { sys: mingw32, env: i686 }\n        - { sys: ucrt64,  env: ucrt-x86_64 }\n        - { sys: clang64, env: clang-x86_64 }\n  steps:\n    - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n      with:\n        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n        install: mingw-w64-${{matrix.env}}-openssl\n```\n\nAlternatively, option `pacboy` allows using a single matrix variable:\n\n```yml\n  strategy:\n    matrix:\n      sys:\n        - mingw64\n        - mingw32\n        - ucrt64\n        - clang64\n  steps:\n    - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n      with:\n        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n        pacboy: openssl:p\n```\n\nFurthermore, [.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml](.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml) is a [Reusable Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)\nto build and test a package in GitHub Actions using a PKGBUILD recipe.\nIt can be used along with [matrix](./matrix) (a [Composite Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)),\nas shown in [.github/workflows/Tool.yml](.github/workflows/Tool.yml).\n\nNote: By default, GitHub Actions terminates any running jobs if any job in matrix\nfails. This default behavior can be disabled by setting `fail-fast: false` in\nstrategy section. See\n[docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategyfail-fast)\nfor more details.\n\nFind similar patterns in the following workflows:\n\n- [examples/cmake.yml](examples/cmake.yml)\n- [msys2/MINGW-packages: .github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)\n\nFind further details at [#171](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/171#issuecomment-961458598) and [#102](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/102).\n\n### Options\n\n#### msystem\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `MSYS | MINGW64 | MINGW32 | UCRT64 | CLANG32 | CLANG64 | CLANGARM64`\n* Default: `MINGW64`\n\nThe default [environment](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) that is used in the `msys2` command/shell provided by this action.\n\nMSYS2 recommends `UCRT64` nowadays as the default instead of `MINGW64`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: UCRT64\n```\n\nThe environment can be later overridden using the `MSYSTEM` environment variable if needed.\nThis is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts.\nFor example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: MSYS\n  - shell: msys2 {0}\n    run: |\n      makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar\n      pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz\n  - run: |\n      set MSYSTEM=UCRT64\n      msys2 -c \'<command to test the package>\'\n```\n\n#### update\n\n* Type: `boolean`\n* Default: `false`\n\nBy default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball.\nBy setting option `update` to `true`, the action will update the package database and all already installed packages.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n```\n\n#### install\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: a whitespace separated list of packages\n* Default: -\n\nInstalling additional packages after updating the system is supported through option `install`.\nThe package or list of packages are installed through `pacman --noconfirm -S --needed --overwrite *`.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n      install: >-\n        git\n        curl\n```\n\n#### pacboy\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: s whitespace separated list of packages\n* Default: -\n\nInstalling additional packages with [pacboy](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/#avoiding-writing-long-package-names) after updating the system is supported through option `pacboy`.\nThe package or list of packages are installed through `pacboy --noconfirm -S --needed`.\n\n```yaml\n  strategy:\n    fail-fast: false\n    matrix:\n      sys: [ MINGW64, MINGW32, UCRT64, CLANG64 ]\n  steps:\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n      install: >-\n        git\n        curl\n      pacboy: >-\n        openssl:p\n```\n\n#### platform-check-severity\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `warn | fatal`\n* Default: `warn`\n\nBy default (`fatal`), throw an error if the runner OS is not Windows.\nIf set to `warn`, simply log a message and skip the rest:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      platform-check-severity: warn\n```\n\n### Advanced Options\n\nThese options are rarely needed and shouldn\'t be used unless there is a good reason.\n\n#### path-type\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `minimal | strict | inherit`\n* Default: `minimal`\n\nDefines which parts of the Windows `$env:PATH` environment variable leak into the MSYS2 environment.\nAllowed values:\n\n- `strict`: do not inherit anything from `$env:PATH`.\n- `minimal` *(default)*: only inherit the default Windows paths from `$env:PATH` (so that `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`\n  are available for example).\n- `inherit`: inherit everything;

253,"b""# Verify Pull Request Label Action\n\n[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/162d73a2aff6478081cdc34ee9ee7b6e)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)\n\n## Description\n\nThis action will verify if a pull request has at least one label from a set of valid labels, as well as no label from a set of invalid labels. The sets of valid and invalid labels are defined by the user and passed as input arguments.\n\nTo prevent the merging of an invalid pull request, this action uses either the standard pull request workflow or the status of the GitHub Action check.\n\n### Using the standard pull request workflow\n\nBy default, this action uses the standard pull request workflow. In this mode, if the pull request does not contain a label from the set of valid labels, or contains a label from the set of invalid labels, then the action will create a pull request review using the event `REQUEST_CHANGES`; independent reviews are generated for both cases. Otherwise, the action will instead create a pull request review using the event `APPROVE`. In both of these cases the exit code will be `0`, and the GitHub Action check will always succeed.\n\nThe `REQUEST_CHANGES` review will prevent the merging of the pull request (if the option `Require pull request reviews before merging` is enabled in the repository) until the `APPROVE` review is generated. After that, the pull request can be merged.\n\nWhen this action runs, it will look for the previous review done by itself, and it will not repeat the same request again. However, if the option `Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed` is enabled in the repository, previous review will be automatically dismissed and therefore this check will fail, and a new request will always be generated.\n\n**Note**: if you want to use the `Require pull request reviews before merging` to require reviews approval before merging pull requests, then you need to increase the number of `Required approving reviewers` by one, as this check will do an approval when a valid label is present. So, for example, if you want at least one reviewer approval, then set this value to 2.\n\n### Using the GitHub Action check status\n\nOn the other hand, the creations of reviews can be disabled by setting the input `disable-reviews` to `true`. In this mode, if the pull request does not contain a label from the set of valid labels, or contains a label from the set of invalid labels, then the action will exit with an error code (`1`), and the GitHub Action check will fail. Otherwise, the action will instead exit with the code `0`, and the GitHub Action check will succeed. In both cases, the action won't create any pull request review.\n\nThe failing of the GitHub Action check will prevent the merging of the pull request (if the option `Require status checks to pass before merging` is enabled in the repository) until the check succeeds. After that, the pull request can be merged.\n\n## Note when working with forks\n\nWhen a pull request is opened from a forked repository, Github actions run with read-only permissions, and so the action won't be able to create a pull request review.\n\nFortunately, Github recently added a new trigger event `pull_request_target` which behaves in an almost identical way to the `pull_request` event, but the action runs in the base of the pull request and will therefore have write permission. However, as the action runs in the base of the pull request, the pull request number is not available in the environmental variables, and must therefore be passed as an input argument. Please refer to the example usage section for more details.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `github-token`\n\n**Required** The GitHub token.\n\n### `valid-labels`\n\n**Required** A list of valid labels. It must be a quoted string, with label separated by commas. For example: `'bug, enhancement'`\n\n### `invalid-labels`\n\n**Optional** A list of invalid labels. It must be a quoted string, with label separated by commas. For example: `'help wanted, invalid'`.\n\n### `pull-request-number`\n\nDepending on the trigger condition used, this input is:\n*   **Required** when the action is triggered using `pull_request_target`. It is available in the github context as: `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`. Or,\n*   **Optional** when the action is triggered using `pull_request`. In this case this number is is automatically extracted from the environmental variables.\n\n### `disable-reviews`\n\n**Optional** Set to `true` to disable the creation on pull request reviews, and use the status of the check instead.\n\n## Example usage\n\nNormally, in your project you would want to allow PRs both from the same repository as well as forks. In that case, you must use the trigger condition `pull_request_target`, as described in this example:\n\nIn your workflow YAML file add these steps:\n```yaml\nuses: jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action@v1.4.0\nwith:\n    github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'\n    valid-labels: 'bug, enhancement'\n    invalid-labels: 'help wanted, invalid'\n    pull-request-number: '${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}'\n```\n\nand trigger it with:\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request_target:\n   types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, synchronize]\n```\n\nThe above example should you preferred method. Nevertheless, the trigger condition `pull_request` is also supported, and you can use it instead of `pull_request_target`. This condition, however, works only for PRs from the same repository; its only advantage is that the `pull-request-number` input is not needed in this case and can be omitted. So, if you want to use that condition instead, follow this example:\n\nIn your workflow YAML file add this step:\n```yaml\nuses: jesusvasquez333/verify-pr-label-action@v1.4.0\nwith:\n    github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'\n    valid-labels: 'bug, enhancement'\n    invalid-labels: 'help wanted, invalid'\n```\n\nand trigger it with:\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n   types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, synchronize]\n```\n\nPlease note that you must use only **one** trigger condition for your action, either `pull_request_target` or `pull_request`, but not both at the same time.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This allows the action to run as intended when an earlier step adds a label. It will use `github.token` by default, and you can set the `token` input to provide alternative authentication.\n\nIf successful, any matching labels will be output in `outputs.labels` as a comma separated string.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Complete example\n\n```yaml\nname: Pull Request Labels\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, synchronize]\njobs:\n  label:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      issues: write\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n        with:\n          mode: exactly\n          count: 1\n          labels: ""semver:patch, semver:minor, semver:major""\n```\n\n### Prevent merging if a label exists\n\n```yaml\n- uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n  with:\n    mode: exactly\n    count: 0\n    labels: ""do not merge""\n```\n\n### Post a comment when the check fails\n\nYou can choose to add a comment to the PR when the action fails. The default format is:\n\n> Label error. Requires {{ errorString }} {{ count }} of: {{ provided }}. Found: {{ applied }}\n\n```yaml\n- uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n  with:\n    mode: exactly\n    count: 1\n    labels: ""semver:patch, semver:minor, semver:major""\n    add_comment: true\n```\n\nIf a comment already exists, it will be updated. When the action passes, the comment will be deleted.\n\n### Customising the failure message / comment\n\nYou can also customise the message used by providing the `message` input:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n  with:\n    mode: exactly\n    count: 1\n    labels: ""semver:patch, semver:minor, semver:major""\n    add_comment: true\n    message: ""This PR is being prevented from merging because you have added one of our blocking labels: {{ provided }}. You\'ll need to remove it before this PR can be merged.""\n```\n\nThe following tokens are available for use in custom messages:\n\n| Token       | Value                                    |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| mode        | One of: `exactly`, `minimum`, `maximum`  |\n| count       | The value of the `count` input           |\n| errorString | One of: `exactly`, `at least`, `at most` |\n| provided    | The value of the `labels` input          |\n| applied     | The labels that are applied to the PR    |\n\n### Require multiple labels\n\n```yaml\n- uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n  with:\n    mode: minimum\n    count: 2\n    labels: ""community-reviewed, team-reviewed, codeowner-reviewed""\n```\n\n### Preventing comment collisions\n\nThis action uses a combination of the workflow name/path, job ID, and step ID to add an invisible ""match token"" to the beginning of any comments it creates. That way, it can later know which comments it owns when modifying them, while supporting multiple ""instances"" of this action to be run at the same time within a repo.\n\nHowever, note that if any of those three identifiers change, any ""in flight"" comments on open PRs may be orphaned (since the final match token will have changed between runs). If you rename any of those identifiers, you will have to delete any orphaned comments manually.\n\n### Controlling failure\n\nYou can set `exit_type` to success then inspect `outputs.status` to see if the action passed or failed. This is useful when you want to perform additional actions if a label is not present, but not fail the entire build.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n  with:\n    mode: minimum\n    count: 2\n    labels: ""community-reviewed, team-reviewed, codeowner-reviewed""\n    exit_type: success # Can be: success or failure (default: failure)\n```\n\nIf the action passed, `outputs.status` will be `success`. If it failed, `outputs.status` will be `failure`.\n\nHere is a complete workflow example for this use case:\n\n```yaml\nname: Pull Request Labels\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, synchronize]\njobs:\n  label:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      issues: write\n      pull-requests: write\n    outputs:\n      status: ${{ steps.check-labels.outputs.status }}\n    steps:\n      - id: check-labels\n        uses: mheap/github-action-required-labels@v5\n        with:\n          mode: exactly\n          count: 1\n          labels: ""semver:patch, semver:minor, semver:major""\n          exit_type: success\n  do-other:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: label\n    steps:\n      - run: echo SUCCESS\n        if: needs.label.outputs.status == \'success\'\n      - run: echo FAILURE && exit 1\n        if: needs.label.outputs.status == \'failure\'\n```\n\n### Using Output Labels\n\nIf the action was successful you can access the matching labels via `outputs.labels`.

Examples:\n\n* a GitHub release is published\n* a commit is pushed to master\n* a pull request is merged to master\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nFirst thing first, let\'s make sure you have the necessary pre-requisites.\n\n### Pre-requisites\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your repo\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n### Inputs\n\n#### `tagName`\n\n**Required** The tag being released. This is used as the Sentry release name. You can optionally prefix it using `releaseNamePrefix`.\n\n#### `environment`\n\n**Required** The name of the environment the release was deployed to.\n\n#### `releaseNamePrefix`\n\n**Optional** String that is prefixed to the tag to form the Sentry release name.\n\n> Please review Sentry\'s documentation regarding max length and supported characters in release names.\n\nFor more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)\n\n#### `sourceMapOptions`\n\n**Optional** A JSON object containing options to control [source map uploading](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps).\n\nRefer to [Sentry\'s CLI JS](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/blob/1f5cdbb6897e41a7e9a3892aea3b34b4c0341207/js/releases/index.js#L114-L144) for possible values. The only required value is `include` which is an array of paths to upload source maps from.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n#### `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`\n\n**Required** Sentry auth token. The token needs the `org:read` and `project:releases` scopes.\n\n#### `SENTRY_ORG`\n\n**Required** Sentry organization.\n\n#### `SENTRY_PROJECT`\n\n**Required** Sentry project name.\n\n#### `SENTRY_URL`\n\n**Optional** URL to the Sentry instance, useful for e.g. on-prem deployments.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```yml\nname: Create a Sentry.io release\nuses: tclindner/sentry-releases-action@v1.2.0\nenv:\n  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n  SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg\n  SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject\nwith:\n  tagName: ${{ github.ref }}\n  environment: qa\n```\n\n> Note: `sentry-releases-action` will automatically trim `refs/tags/` from `tagName`. This means you can pass `GITHUB_REF` directly from release events without the need of mutating it first.\n\nIf you prefer to use the commit as the release name, use `${{ github.sha }}` for the `tagName` parameter.\n\n### Full example workflow\n\nOn every GitHub `release` event.\n\n```yaml\nname: ReleaseWorkflow\n\non:\n  release:\n    types: [published, prereleased]\n\n\njobs:\n  createSentryRelease:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Create a Sentry.io release\n        uses: tclindner/sentry-releases-action@v1.2.0\n        env:\n          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg\n          SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject\n        with:\n          tagName: ${{ github.ref }}\n          environment: qa\n```\n\nAssume you tagged your release as `v1.0.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.0.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `v1.0.0`.\n\n### Example workflow with optional release prefix\n\nOn every GitHub `release` event.\n\n```yaml\nname: ReleaseWorkflow\n\non:\n  release:\n    types: [published, prereleased]\n\n\njobs:\n  createSentryRelease:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Create a Sentry.io release\n        uses: tclindner/sentry-releases-action@v1.2.0\n        env:\n          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg\n          SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject\n        with:\n          tagName: ${{ github.ref }}\n          environment: qa\n          releaseNamePrefix: myAwesomeProject-\n```\n\nScenario 1: Assume you tagged your release as `v1.1.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject-v1.1.0`.\n\nScenario 2: Assume you tagged your release as `1.1.0` and you set `releaseNamePrefix` to `myAwesomeProject@`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject@1.1.0`.\n\n> Note: This action only works on Linux x86_64 systems.\n\n### Example workflow with optional sourcemap upload\n\nOn every GitHub `release` event.\n\n```yaml\nname: ReleaseWorkflow\n\non:\n  release:\n    types: [published, prereleased]\n\n\njobs:\n  createSentryRelease:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Create a Sentry.io release\n        uses: tclindner/sentry-releases-action@v1.2.0\n        env:\n          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg\n          SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject\n        with:\n          tagName: ${{ github.ref }}\n          environment: qa\n          releaseNamePrefix: myAwesomeProject-\n          sourceMapOptions: \'{""include"": [""build""]}\'\n```\n\nAs noted above, refer to [Sentry\'s CLI JS](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/blob/1f5cdbb6897e41a7e9a3892aea3b34b4c0341207/js/releases/index.js#L114-L144) for possible values. `include` is the only required value.\n\n> Note: This action only works on Linux x86_64 systems.\n\n## Related\n\n[sentry-release-deploy-action](https://github.com/tclindner/sentry-release-deploy-action) - Action used create a deploy for an existing release created by this action.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Release History\n\nPlease see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019-2023 Thomas Lindner.

265,"b""# julia-pkgbutler\n\n## Overview\n\nThe GitHub Action repository for the Julia Package Butler.\n\nThe underlying functionality for `julia-pkgbutler` is provided by the [`PkgButlerEngine.jl` Julia package](https://github.com/davidanthoff/PkgButlerEngine.jl).\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe Julia Package Butler currently makes the following changes to a package repository:\n\n- The GitHub Action workflow for the Package Butler itself is updated to the latest version.\n- If the `Project.toml` doesn't have a version bound for `julia` in the `compat` section, it will add a version bound declaring the package compatible with Julia 1.0.\n- It will add GitHub Action workflows for continuous integration. These workflows are automatically configured to only run on Julia versions that are compatible with the `compat` entry for Julia in the `Project.toml` file of the package.\n- If a `docs/make.jl` file exists, a GitHub Action workflow that builds and deploys documentation is added to the package.\n- If a `docs/Project.toml` file exists, the butler will ensure that the version bound on Documenter.jl is no lower than 0.24 (the first version to support building documentation with GitHub Actions).\n- Enable [CompatHelper.jl](https://github.com/bcbi/CompatHelper.jl) for the repository.\n- Enable [TagBot](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot) for the repository.\n\nWhen the `bach` template is used, these additional channges are made:\n- Travis and Appveyor configuration files are removed.\n- Whenever any Julia file on `master` is not properly formatted, a PR with formatting changes is opened (based on https://github.com/julia-vscode/DocumentFormat.jl).\n- Any PR has an additional check whether Julia code files are properly formatted.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If you specify a version range, the **highest** available Julia version that matches the range will be selected.\n\n> **Warning**\n>\n> It is strongly recommended to wrap versions in quotes. Otherwise, the YAML parser used by GitHub Actions parses certain versions as numbers which causes the wrong version to be selected. For example, `1.0` may be parsed as `1`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- `1.2.0` is a valid semver version. The action will try to download exactly this version. If it\'s not available, the build step will fail.\n- `1.0` is a version range that will match the highest available Julia version that starts with `1.0`, e.g. `1.0.5`, excluding pre-releases.\n- `^1.3.0-rc1` is a **caret** version range that includes pre-releases of `1.3.0` starting at `rc1`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-rc1` and `< 2.0.0`.\n- `~1.3.0-rc1` is a **tilde** version range that includes pre-releases of `1.3.0` starting at `rc1`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-rc1` and `< 1.4.0`.\n- `^1.3.0-0` is a **caret** version range that includes _all_ pre-releases of `1.3.0`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-` and `< 2.0.0`.\n- `~1.3.0-0` is a **tilde** version range that includes _all_ pre-releases of `1.3.0`. It matches all versions `\xe2\x89\xa5 1.3.0-` and `< 1.4.0`.\n- `nightly` will install the latest nightly build.\n- `1.7-nightly` will install the latest nightly build for the upcoming 1.7 release. This version will only be available during certain phases of the Julia release cycle.\n\nInternally the action uses node\'s semver package to resolve version ranges. Its [documentation](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#advanced-range-syntax) contains more details on the version range syntax. You can test what version will be selected for a given input in this JavaScript [REPL](https://repl.it/@SaschaMann/setup-julia-version-logic).\n\n#### Prereleases\n\nThere are two methods of including pre-releases in version matching:\n\n1. Including the pre-release tag in the version itself, e.g. `^1.3.0-rc1`.\n2. Setting the input `include-all-prereleases` to `true`.\n\nThese behave slightly differently.\n\n1. If the version `a.b.c` contains pre-release tag, all pre-releases of version `a.b.c` will be included in the version matching.\nFor example, `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.3.0-rc2` but would **not** match `1.4.0-rc1` once released.\n2. If `include-preleases` is set to true, **all** pre-releases of all versions will be included in the version matching. In this case, `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.4.0-rc1` once released.\n\n**Example:** Without `include-all-prereleases: true`, the version `^1.3.0-rc1` would match `1.3.0-rc1`, `1.3.0-rc2`, `1.3.0`, `1.4.0` once they are released.\nWith `include-all-prereleases: true`, it would match `1.3.0-rc1`, `1.3.0-rc2`, `1.3.0`, `1.4.0-rc1`, `1.4.0`.\n\nIf you want to run tests against the latest tagged version, no matter what version that is, you can use\n\n```yaml\n- uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1\n  with:\n    version: \'1\'\n    include-all-prereleases: true\n```\n\n#### Recently released versions\n\nThe available Julia versions are pulled from [`versions.json`](https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json).\n\n### Matrix Testing\n\n`bash` is chosen as shell to enforce consistent behaviour across operating systems. [Other shells](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell) are available but you may have to escape quotation marks or otherwise adjust the syntax.\n\n#### 64-bit Julia only\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        julia-version: [\'1.0\', \'1.2.0\', \'^1.3.0-rc1\']\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1.0.0\n      - name: ""Set up Julia""\n        uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1\n        with:\n          version: ${{ matrix.julia-version }}\n      - run: julia -e \'println(""Hello, World!"")\'\n        shell: bash\n```\n\n#### 32-bit Julia\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        julia-version: [\'1.0\', \'1.2.0\', \'^1.3.0-rc1\']\n        julia-arch: [x64, x86]\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]\n        # 32-bit Julia binaries are not available on macOS\n        exclude:\n          - os: macOS-latest\n            julia-arch: x86\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1.0.0\n      - name: ""Set up Julia""\n        uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1\n        with:\n          version: ${{ matrix.julia-version }}\n          arch: ${{ matrix.julia-arch }}\n      - run: julia -e \'println(""Hello, World!"")\'\n        shell: bash\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can include specific version and OS combinations that will use 32-bit Julia:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        julia-version: [\'1.0\', \'1.2.0\', \'^1.3.0-rc1\']\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]\n        # Additionally create a job using 32-bit Julia 1.0.4 on windows-latest\n        include:\n          - os: windows-latest\n            julia-version: [\'1.0.4\']\n            julia-arch: x86\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1.0.0\n      - name: ""Set up Julia""\n        uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1\n        with:\n          version: ${{ matrix.julia-version }}\n      - run: julia -e \'println(""Hello, World!"")\'\n        shell: bash\n```\n\n### versioninfo\n\nBy default, only the output of `julia --version` is printed as verification that Julia has been installed for stable versions of Julia.\n`InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()` is run by default for nightly builds.\n\nStarting Julia and printing the full versioninfo takes a significant amount of time (1s or ~10% of the total build time in testing), so you may not want to run it in every build, in particular on paid runners as this cost will add up quickly.\nHowever, `julia --version` does not provide sufficient information to know which commit a nightly binary was built from, therefore it is useful to show the full versioninfo on nightly builds regardless.\n\nYou can override this behaviour by changing the input to `never` if you never want to run `InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()` or to `true` if you always want to run `InteractiveUtils.versioninfo()`, even on stable Julia builds.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis action follows [GitHub\'s advice](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#versioning-your-action) on versioning actions, with an additional `latest` tag.\n\nIf you don\'t want to deal with updating the version of the action, similiarly to how Travis CI handles it, use `latest` or major version branches. [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) can also be used to automatically create Pull Requests to update actions used in your workflows.\n\nIt\'s unlikely, but not impossible, that there will be breaking changes post-v1.0.0 unless a new major version of Julia is introduced.\n\nYou can specify commits, branches or tags in your workflows as follows:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@d3ce119a16594ea9e5d7974813970c73b6ab9e94 # commit SHA of the tagged 1.4.1 commit\n  - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@latest  # latest version tag (may break existing workflows)\n  - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1      # major version tag\n  - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1.4    # minor version tag\n  - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1.4.1  # specific version tag\n```\n\nIf your workflow requires access to secrets, you should always pin it to a commit SHA instead of a tag.\nThis will protect you in case a bad actor gains access to the setup-julia repo.\nYou can find more information in [GitHub\'s security hardening guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions).\n\n## Debug logs\n\nYou can enable [Step Debug Logs](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs) for more detailed logs.\nNote that when debug logs are enabled, a request will be sent to `https://httpbin.julialang.org/ip` and the runner\'s IP will be printed to the debug logs.\n\n## Third party information\nParts of this software have been derived from other open source software.\nSee [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md) for details.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This can easily be achieved with the [setup-julia](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-julia-environment) action.\n\nAn example workflow that uses this action might look like this:\n\n```yaml\nname: Run tests\n\non: \n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        julia-version: [\'1.0\', \'1\', \'nightly\']\n        julia-arch: [x64, x86]\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]\n        exclude:\n          - os: macOS-latest\n            julia-arch: x86\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1\n        with:\n          version: ${{ matrix.julia-version }}\n          arch: ${{ matrix.julia-arch }}\n      - uses: julia-actions/julia-buildpkg@v1\n      - uses: julia-actions/julia-runtest@v1\n        # with:\n        #   annotate: true\n```\n\nYou can add this workflow to your repository by placing it in a file called `test.yml` in the folder `.github/workflows/`. [More info here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).\n\nHere, setting `annotate: true` causes GitHub ""annotations"" to appear when reviewing the PR, pointing to failing tests, if any.\nThis functionality is only enabled on Julia 1.8 (even if `annotate` is set to `true`), since currently it does not work on other Julia versions (see #76).\n\nBy default, `annotate` is set to false, but that may change in future releases of this action.\n### Prefixing the Julia command\n\nIn some packages, you may want to prefix the `julia` command with another command, e.g. for running tests of certain graphical libraries with `xvfb-run`.\nIn that case, you can add an input called `prefix` containing the command that will be inserted to your workflow:\n\n```yaml\n      - uses: julia-actions/julia-runtest@v1\n        with:\n          prefix: xvfb-run\n```\n\nIf you only want to add this prefix on certain builds, you can [include additional values into a combination](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-additional-values-into-combinations) of your build matrix, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]\n        version: [\'1.0\', \'1\', \'nightly\']\n        arch: [x64]\n        include:\n          - os: ubuntu-latest\n            prefix: xvfb-run\n    steps:\n    # ...\n      - uses: julia-actions/julia-runtest@v1\n        with:\n          prefix: ${{ matrix.prefix }}\n    # ...\n```\n\nThis will add the prefix `xvfb-run` to all builds where the `os` is `ubuntu-latest`.\n\n\n### Registry flavor preference\n\nThis actions defines (and exports for subsequent steps of the workflow) the\nenvironmental variable `JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE=eager` unless it\nis already set.

mean *Git tags* and *GitHub releases*, and not releases in a registry that allow the Julia package manager to install your package.\nTagBot does not register your package for you, see the

aren\'t at all necessary, but it\'s considered a good practice.\n\nOther benefits of using TagBot include the ability for you and your users to browse package code at specific releases, and automatically-generated changelogs for each release that keep your users in the loop.\n\n## Setup\n\nCreate a file at `.github/workflows/TagBot.yml` with the following contents:\n\n```yml\nname: TagBot\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types:\n      - created\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      lookback:\n        default: 3\npermissions:\n  actions: read\n  checks: read\n  contents: write\n

 token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          # Edit the following line to reflect the actual name of the GitHub Secret containing your private key\n          ssh: ${{ secrets.DOCUMENTER_KEY }}\n          # ssh: ${{ secrets.NAME_OF_MY_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET }}\n```\n\nNo further action is required on your part.\nWhen you add a new release to a registry with Registrator, TagBot will create a GitHub release on your package\'s repository.\n\nYou may, however, want to customize the behaviour via the available configuration options.\n\nFor example, if you use GitHub Actions to build the documentation for your package, you will find that with the default TagBot configuration, your documentation build is not triggered when a new tag is created.\nIn this case, you will need to use [SSH Deploy Keys](#ssh-deploy-keys).\n\nRead on for a full description of all of the available configuration options.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- Basic Configuration Options:\n  - [SSH Deploy Keys](#ssh-deploy-keys)\n  - [Changelogs](#changelogs)\n  - [Custom Registries](#custom-registries)\n- Advanced Configuration Options:\n  - [Self-Hosted GitHub](#self-hosted-github)\n  - [Git configuration](#git-configuration)\n  - [GPG Signing](#gpg-signing)\n  - [Lookback Period](#lookback-period)\n  - [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats)\n  - [Pre-Release Hooks](#pre-release-hooks)\n  - [Release Branch Selection](#release-branch-selection)\n  - [Release Branch Management](#release-branch-management)\n- [Local Usage](#local-usage)\n\n## Basic Configuration Options\n\n### SSH Deploy Keys\n\nSometimes, instead of using the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, it is better to use an SSH deploy key.\nThe most notable reason is that the default token does not have permission to trigger events for other GitHub Actions, such as documentation builds for new tags.\n\nTo use an SSH deploy key:\n\n- Create an SSH key and add it to your repository by following the instructions [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#setup-2).\n  Make sure to give it write permissions.\n- Create a repository secret by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).\n  Use whatever you like as the name, such as `SSH_KEY`.\n  Use the private key contents as the value.\n- Add the `ssh` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  ssh: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}\n```\n\nIf you already have a Base64-encoded deploy key and matching repository secret for Documenter, you can reuse it instead of creating a new one.\n\nIf your key is password-protected, you\'ll also need to include the password in another repository secret (not Base64-encoded):\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  ssh: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}\n  ssh_password: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\n### Changelogs\n\nTagBot creates a changelog for each release based on the issues that have been closed and the pull requests that have been merged.\nAdditionally, you can write custom release notes in the same place that you register your packages.\nSee [Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/#release-notes) or [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) for specifics.\n\nThe changelog is completely customizable with the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine.\nTo supply your own template, use the `changelog` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  changelog: |\n    This is release {{ version }} of {{ package }}.\n    {% if custom %}\n    Here are my release notes!\n    {{ custom }}\n    {% endif %}\n```\n\nThe data available to you looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""compare_url"": ""https://github.com/Owner/Repo/compare/previous_version...current_version (or null for first release)"",\n  ""custom"": ""your custom release notes"",\n  ""issues"": [\n    {\n      ""author"": {\n        ""name"": ""Real Name"",\n        ""url"": ""https://github.com/username"",\n        ""username"": ""their login""\n      },\n      ""body"": ""issue body"",\n      ""labels"": [""label1"", ""label2""],\n      ""closer"": {""same format as"": ""issue author but sometimes null""},\n      ""number"": 123,\n      ""title"": ""issue title"",\n      ""url"": ""https://github.com/Owner/Repo/issues/123""\n    }\n  ],\n  ""package"": ""PackageName"",\n  ""previous_release"": ""v1.1.2 (or null for first release)"",\n  ""pulls"": [\n    {\n      ""author"": {""same format as"": ""issue author""},\n      ""body"": ""pull request body"",\n      ""labels"": [""label1"", ""label2""],\n      ""merger"": {""same format as"": ""issue author""},\n      ""number"": 123,\n      ""title"": ""pull request title"",\n      ""url"": ""https://github.com/Owner/Repo/pull/123""\n    }\n  ],\n  ""sha"": ""commit SHA"",\n  ""version"": ""v1.2.3"",\n  ""version_url"": ""https://github.com/Owner/Repo/tree/v1.2.3""\n}\n```\n\nYou can see the default template in [`action.yml`](action.yml).\n\nIssues and pull requests with specified labels are not included in the changelog data.\nBy default, the following labels are ignored:\n\n- changelog skip\n- duplicate\n- exclude from changelog\n- invalid\n- no changelog\n- question\n- wont fix\n\nTo supply your own labels, use the `changelog_ignore` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  changelog_ignore: ignore this label, ignore this label too\n```\n\nWhite-space, case, dashes, and underscores are ignored when comparing labels.\n\n### Custom Registries\n\nIf you\'re using a custom registry, add the `registry` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  registry: MyOrg/MyRegistry\n```\n\nIf your registry is public, this is all you need to do.\nIf your registry is private, you\'ll need to configure access to it via one of two options.\n\nThe first option is to change the `token` input to a [PAT](#personal-access-tokens-pats) that has access to both your package repository and the registry.\nTake a look at the warnings about PATs if you choose this option.\n\nThe other option is to use the `registry_ssh` input, like so:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  registry: MyOrg/MyRegistry\n  registry_ssh: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_SSH_KEY }}\n```\n\nHere, the `REGISTRY_SSH_KEY` is the private key portion of a read-only [SSH deploy key](#ssh-deploy-keys) for your registry.\nBy using this method, the only extra access that TagBot receives is read access to your private registry, not to any other repositories in your user/organization account.\n\n## Advanced Configuration Options\n\n### Self-Hosted GitHub\n\nIf your company is running their own GitHub server, then you\'ll need to update the relevant GitHub URL inputs, `github` and `github_api`:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  github: git.corp.com\n  github_api: api.git.corp.com\n```\n\n### Git Configuration\n\nBy default, the Git tags that TagBot creates are authored by a user called `github-actions[bot]`, whose email is `41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`.\nIf you want to use your own Git author info, you can set the `user` and `email` inputs:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  user: My Name\n  email: my.email@web.site\n```\n\n### Draft Releases\n\nIf you\'d prefer to create a draft GitHub release instead of a full Git tag + GitHub release, use the `draft` input:\n\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  draft: true\n```\n\n### GPG Signing\n\nIf you want to create signed tags, you can supply your own GPG private key.\nYour key can be exported with `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <ID>`, and optionally Base64-encoded.\nCreate the repository secret, then use the `gpg` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  gpg: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY }}\n```\n\nIf your key is password-protected, you\'ll also need to include the password in another repository secret (not Base64-encoded):\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  gpg: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY }}\n  gpg_password: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\nIt\'s also recommended to set your Git email address to one that is attached to the GPG key (see [Git Configuration](#git-configuration)).\nIf you fail to do so, your tags will be marked ""Unverified"" in the GitHub UI.\n\n### Lookback Period\n\nBy default, TagBot checks for new releases that are at most 3 days old.\nTherefore, if you only run TagBot every five days, it might miss some releases.\nTo fix this, you can specify a custom number of days to look back in time with the `lookback` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  lookback: 14\n```\n\nAn extra hour is always added, so if you run TagBot every 5 days, you can safely set this input to `5`.\n\n### Personal Access Tokens (PATs)\n\nWe highly recommend that you use an SSH deploy key instead of a personal access token (PAT).\n\nPlease keep in mind that there are security concerns with using a PAT.\nFor example, a PAT has access to all of your repositories.\nTo reduce the consequences of a secret being leaked, we recommend that you instead use an [SSH deploy key](#ssh-deploy-keys) that only has permissions for a single repository.\n\n\nTo use a PAT:\n\n- Create a PAT by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token).\n  Make sure that it has the `repo` scope.\n- Create a repository secret by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).\n  Use whatever you like as the name, such as `TAGBOT_PAT`.\n  Use the new PAT as the value.\n- Replace the `token` input\'s value with the name of your secret, like so:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.TAGBOT_PAT }}\n```\n\n### Pre-Release Hooks\n\nIf you want to make something happen just before releases are created, you can do so with the `dispatch` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.TAGBOT_PAT }}\n  dispatch: true\n```\n\nWhen you enable this option, a [repository dispatch event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#repositorydispatchevent) is created before releases are created.\nThis means that you can set up your own actions that perform any necessary pre-release tasks.\n\nThe payload is an object mapping from version to commit SHA, which can contain multiple entries and looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""v1.2.3"": ""abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01""\n}\n```\n\nThese actions will have 5 minutes to run by default, but you can customize the number of minutes with the `dispatch_delay` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.TAGBOT_PAT }}\n  dispatch: true\n  dispatch_delay: 30\n```\n\nAvoid setting a delay longer than the interval between TagBot runs, since your dispatch event will probably be triggered multiple times and the same release will also be attempted more than once.\n\nTo use the `dispatch` feature, you must provide your own personal access token.\nFor more details, see [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats).\n\n### Release Branch Selection\n\nIf you use a non-standard Git workflow where your default branch is not the main development branch, you may want to set the `branch` input to the name of your preferred release branch:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  branch: release\n```\n\nThe branch you set will be the first one searched for a commit to tag, and releases will be anchored to that branch when possible.\n\n### Release Branch Management\n\nIf you\'re using [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) to release your packages, TagBot can manage the merging and deletion of the release branches that it creates.\nTo enable this feature, use the `branches` input:\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  branches: true\n```\n\n## Local Usage\n\nThere are some scenarios in which you want to manually run TagBot.\nPerhaps TagBot failed for some reason, or GitHub\'s service was down, or you just set up TagBot but would like to fill in tags for old releases.\nThe simplest way to run TagBot manually is through Docker and the `tagbot.local` module.\n\n```sh\n$ docker run --rm ghcr.io/juliaregistries/tagbot python -m tagbot.local --help\nUsage: __main__.py [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  --repo TEXT        Repo to tag\n  --version TEXT     Version to tag\n  --token TEXT       GitHub API token\n  --github TEXT      GitHub URL\n  --github-api TEXT  GitHub API URL\n  --changelog TEXT   Changelog template\n  --registry TEXT    Registry to search\n  --help             Show this message and exit.\n\n$ docker run --rm ghcr.io/juliaregistries/tagbot python -m tagbot.local \\\n    --repo Owner/Name \\\n    --token <TOKEN> \\\n    --version v1.2.3\n```\n\nOnly the `repo`, `version`, and `token` options are required, and you will be prompted if you don\'t provide them.\nFor instructions on how to obtain a token, see [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](#personal-access-tokens-pats).\n\nYou can also run the code outside of Docker, but you\'ll just need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) first, and ensure that you have Python 3.8.\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot  # Consider --branch vA.B.C\n$ cd TagBot\n$ poetry install\n$ poetry run python -m tagbot.local --help\n```\n'","[0, 0,

The default value is `false`.\n          # only-new-issues: true\n\n          # Optional: if set to true, then all caching functionality will be completely disabled,\n          #           takes precedence over all other caching options.\n          # skip-cache: true\n\n          # Optional: if set to true, then the action won\'t cache or restore ~/go/pkg.\n          # skip-pkg-cache: true\n\n          # Optional: if set to true, then the action won\'t cache or restore ~/.cache/go-build.\n          # skip-build-cache: true\n\n          # Optional: The mode to install golangci-lint. It can be \'binary\' or \'goinstall\'.\n          # install-mode: ""goinstall""\n```\n\nWe recommend running this action in a job separate from other jobs (`go test`, etc)\nbecause different jobs [run in parallel](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/core-concepts-for-github-actions#job).\n\n### Multiple OS Support\n\nIf you need to run linters for specific operating systems, you will need to use `v2` of the action.  Here is a sample configuration file:\n\n```yaml\nname: golangci-lint\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n  # Optional: allow read access to pull request.

The default value is `false`.\n          # only-new-issues: true\n\n          # Optional:The mode to install golangci-lint. It can be \'binary\' or \'goinstall\'.\n          # install-mode: ""goinstall""\n```\n\nYou will also likely need to add the following `.gitattributes` file to ensure that line endings for windows builds are properly formatted:\n\n```.gitattributes\n*.go text eol=lf\n```\n\n## Comments and Annotations\n\nCurrently, GitHub parses the action\'s output and creates [annotations](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/What-are-annotations/td-p/30770).\n\nThe restrictions of annotations are the following:\n\n1. Currently, they don\'t support markdown formatting (see the [feature request](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-API-Development-and/Checks-Ability-to-include-Markdown-in-line-annotations/m-p/56704))\n2. They aren\'t shown in list of comments like it was with [golangci.com](https://golangci.com). If you would like to have comments - please, up-vote [the issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action/issues/5).\n\n## Performance\n\nThe action was implemented with performance in mind:\n\n1. We cache data by [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache) between builds: Go build cache, Go modules cache, golangci-lint analysis cache.\n2. We don\'t use Docker because image pulling is slow.\n3. We do as much as we can in parallel, e.g. we download cache, go and golangci-lint binary in parallel.\n\nFor example, in a repository of [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) running this action without the cache takes 50s, but with cache takes 14s:\n  * in parallel:\n    * 4s to restore 50 MB of cache\n    * 1s to find and install `golangci-lint`\n  * 1s to run `golangci-lint` (it takes 35s without cache)\n\n## Internals\n\nWe use JavaScript-based action. We don\'t use Docker-based action because:\n\n1. docker pulling is slow currently\n2. it\'s easier to use caching from [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache)\n\nWe support different platforms, such as `ubuntu`, `macos` and `windows` with `x32` and `x64` archs.\n\nInside our action we perform 3 steps:\n\n1. Setup environment running in parallel:\n  * restore [cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) of previous analyzes\n  * fetch [action config](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/assets/github-action-config.json) and find the latest `golangci-lint` patch version\n    for needed version (users of this action can specify only minor version of `golangci-lint`). After that install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) using [@actions/tool-cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/tool-cache)\n2. Run `golangci-lint` with specified by user `args`\n3. Save cache for later builds\n\n### Caching internals\n\n1. We save and restore the following directories: `~/.cache/golangci-lint`, `~/.cache/go-build`, `~/go/pkg`.\n2. The primary caching key looks like `golangci-lint.cache-{interval_number}-{go.mod_hash}`. Interval number ensures that we periodically invalidate\n   our cache (every 7 days). `go.mod` hash ensures that we invalidate the cache early - as soon as dependencies have changed.\n3. We use [restore keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key): `golangci-lint.cache-{interval_number}-`. GitHub matches keys by prefix if we have no exact match for the primary cache.\n\nThis scheme is basic and needs improvements. Pull requests and ideas are welcome.\n\n## Development of this action\n\n1. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation)\n2. Make a symlink for `act` to work properly: `ln -s . golangci-lint-action`\n3. Prepare deps once: `npm run prepare-deps`\n4. Run `npm run local` after any change to test it\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
280,"b""# artifact_as_comment\n\n## What?\n\nFetches an artifact file and adds it inline as a comment to a Pull request.\n\n## Why?\n\nCertain jobs' output are useful to have in the PR without navigating away. For example, a code coverage report, or a benchmark run.\n\nGithub Actions' scope is limited to `read` access when running against a Pull Request created from a fork. While this is understandable, it limits the ability\nof Github Action to publish results mentioned above.\n\n## How?\n\nThe roundabout (hacky?) way:\n\n- Use this action to schedule a workflow to run periodically, to scan open pull requests, \n  and it's latest workflow runs to determine if there is an output worth publishing.\n\n- if there's a match, fetch the artifact and post it's content as a comment.\n\n- get the pull request actions to run the jobs and store the output in a certain file.\n\n> *Note:* The filename and artifact name configured in the generating job and the publishing job must match.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis [repository](https://github.com/nyurik/auto_pr_comments_from_forks) validated our theory that an event based mechanism is not currently possible. Thank you @nyurik.\n\n> *Note:* @nyurik's repository uses bash/jq/curl.

Here\xe2\x80\x99s an exemplary GitHub Action using a Redis server in versions 4 and 5 to test a Node.js app:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Git checkout\r\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n\r\n    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\r\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v1\r\n      with:\r\n        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\r\n\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n\r\n    - run: npm install\r\n\r\n    - run: npm test\r\n      env:\r\n        CI: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using a Custom Redis Image\r\nYou can utilize an alternative Redis image using the `redis-image` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6.2.4-v4, 6.2.6-v3]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-image: redis/redis-stack-server\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using Redis on a Custom Port\r\nYou can start the Redis instance on a custom port using the `redis-port` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-port: 12345\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using a Custom Container Name\r\nThis GitHub Action provides a Redis Docker container. The default container name is `redis`. It can be helpful to customize the container name. For example, when running multiple Redis instances in parallel. You can customize the container name using the `redis-container-name` input:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-container-name: redis-auth-token-cache\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remove container when exit\r\nStarting in v1.6.0, when running this action on a self-hosted runner, it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to remove the container so its name won\xe2\x80\x99t conflict:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Run tests\r\n\r\non: [push]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        redis-version: [6, 7]\r\n\r\n    steps:\r\n    - name: Start Redis\r\n      uses: supercharge/redis-github-action@1.6.0\r\n      with:\r\n        redis-version: ${{ matrix.redis-version }}\r\n        redis-remove-container: true # false by default\r\n\r\n    - name: \xe2\x80\xa6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT \xc2\xa9 [Supercharge](https://superchargejs.com)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> [superchargejs.com](https://superchargejs.com) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;\r\n> GitHub [@supercharge](https://github.com/supercharge) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;\r\n> Twitter [@superchargejs](https://twitter.com/superchargejs)\r\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

You can specify the `variant` input to the action to use a specific installer:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: volta-cli/action@v4\n  with:\n    variant: \'linux-openssl-rhel\'\n\n- run: yarn install\n- run: yarn test\n```\n\nThe `variant` fragment corresponds to a portion of the installer filename, and can be found in the [Volta Releases](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/releases) page.\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
287,"b'# action-visual-snapshot ![test](https://github.com/getsentry/action-visual-snapshot/workflows/test/badge.svg)\n\nThis is a GitHub action that compares 2-3 sets of images and produces a diff using [odiff](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff). The idea is to have your tests generate screenshots, save those screenshots as an artifact in GitHub, compare them to a ""base"" (e.g. main branch) set of images and produce a diff image of the changed pixels, and then upload those diffs as an artifact as well.\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two steps required in your GitHub workflow. First, upload your snapshots as GitHub Action artifact. `path` needs to reference the path where your snapshots are saved and `name` is the name of the artifact for GitHub.\n\n```yml\n  - name: Save snapshots\n    if: always()\n    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n    with:\n      save-only: true\n      path: .artifacts/visual-snapshots\n```\n\nThen you\'ll need to run the action to compare the snapshots (`gcs-bucket` and `gcp-service-account-key`\nare optional and will upload your images to the bucket if specified):\n\n```yml\n    visual-diff:\n      if: ${{ github.ref != \'refs/heads/master\' }}\n      needs: acceptance\n      runs-on: ubuntu-16.04\n\n      steps:\n        - name: Diff snapshots\n          id: visual-snapshots-diff\n          uses: getsentry/action-visual-snapshot@v1\n          with:\n            gcs-bucket: \'sentry-visual-snapshots\'\n            gcp-service-account-key: ${{ secrets.SNAPSHOT_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}\n```\n\n### Multiple diffs\nYou can also have multiple sets of diff actions with some configuration inputs\n\n```yaml\n  - name: Diff snapshots\n    id: visual-snapshots-diff\n    uses: getsentry/action-visual-snapshot@v1\n    with:\n      snapshot-path: .artifacts/visual-snapshots-jest\n      action-name: Jest Snapshots\n      artifact-name: visual-snapshots-jest\n```\n\n## Contributing\nWIP\n\n### Updating Image Gallery Template\n\nThe main template is `src/template/index.ejs` -- this gets ""built"" into a module (that is\nthe actual template) that the action can use and inject data into.\n\n```bash\nyarn dev:gallery && open example_gallery/index.html\n```\n\nFiles changes to `src/template/index.ejs` will rebuild the `example_gallery/index.html` file (although you currently\nneed to save the file twice).\n\n\n### Publishing\nActions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder, this is done by GitHub Actions for all branches.\n\nTo do this manually, run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:\n```bash\n$ yarn dist\n$ git add dist\n$ git commit -a -m ""prod dependencies""\n```\n\n### Local Testing\n\nYou can run this action locally with a script similar to the following:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\nrm -rf /tmp/visual-snapshots-*\nrm -rf .tmp/snaps\nrm -rf ""<< Results Path >>""\n\nyarn dist\n\nGITHUB_REPOSITORY=""getsentry/sentry"" \\\nGITHUB_HEAD_SHA=""<< Commit >>"" \\\nGITHUB_HEAD_REF=""getsentry/sentry/master"" \\\nGITHUB_WORKFLOW=""visual-snapshots"" \\\nGITHUB_WORKSPACE=""."" \\\nACTION_SAVE_ONLY=""false"" \\\nACTION_GITHUB_TOKEN=""<< GitHub Token >>"" \\\nACTION_ARTIFACT_NAME=""visual-snapshots"" \\\nACTION_BASE_ARTIFACT_NAME=""visual-snapshots-base"" \\\nACTION_THRESHOLD=""0.05"" \\\nACTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH=""<< Snapshot Path >>"" \\\nACTION_LOCAL_RUN=""true"" \\\nACTION_RESULTS_PATH=""<< Results Path >>"" \\\nnode ./dist/index.js\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The main features of this action are:\n\n- **Commenting** pull requests with the comparison of Size Limit output.\n- **Rejecting** a pull request if the cost exceeds the limit.\n\n<p align=""center"">\n  <img alt=""pr comment"" width=""540"" src=""/assets/pr.png"">\n</p>\n\n## Usage\n1. Install Size Limit choosing the scenario that fits you better ([JS Application](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#js-applications), [Big Libraries](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#big-libraries) or [Small Libraries](https://github.com/ai/size-limit#small-libraries)).\n2. By default this action will try to build your PR by running `build` [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) located in your `package.json`. If something need to be done after dependencies are installed but before building `postinstall` npm script could be used. For example, using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna):\n```json\n""scripts"": {\n  ""postinstall"": ""lerna bootstrap"",\n  ""build"": ""lerna run build""\n},\n```\n3. Define Size limit configuration. For example (inside `package.json`):\n```json\n""size-limit"": [\n  {\n    ""path"": ""dist/index.js"",\n    ""limit"": ""4500 ms""\n  }\n]\n```\n4. Add the following action inside `.github/workflows/size-limit.yml`\n```yaml\nname: ""size""\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - master\njobs:\n  size:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      CI_JOB_NUMBER: 1\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - uses: andresz1/size-limit-action@v1\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\nYou can optionally specify a custom npm script to run instead of the default `build` adding a `build_script` option to the yml workflow shown above. Additionally, providing a `skip_step` option will tell the action to skip either the `install` or `build` phase.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  build_script: custom-build\n  skip_step: install\n```\n\nAdd `clean_script` option to specify npm script to run after size-limit results are collected. This is useful to clean up leftover assets.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  clean_script: cleanup\n```\n\n5. You are now all set\n\n### Customizing working directory\n\n`directory` option allow to run all the tasks in a subfolder.\nIt\'s only convenient if all your stuff is in a subdirectory of your git repository.\n\nFor instance, if `package.json` is in the subfolder `client/`:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  build_script: custom-build\n  skip_step: install\n  directory: client/\n```\n\n## Feedback\n\nPull requests, feature ideas and bug reports are very welcome.

If you have a different setup, set the\n  `CRAFT_REMOTE` environment variable or the `--remote` option to the git remote\n  you are using.\n\n## Global Configuration\n\nGlobal configuration for `craft` can be done either by using environment\nvariables or by adding values to a configuration file (see below).\n\nAll command line flags can be set through environment variables by prefixing\nthem with `CRAFT_` and converting them to UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED versions:\n\n```shell\nCRAFT_LOG_LEVEL=Debug\nCRAFT_DRY_RUN=1\nCRAFT_NO_INPUT=0\n```\n\nSince Craft heavily relies on GitHub, it needs the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment\nvariable to be set to a proper\n[GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for almost\nanything. The token only needs `repo` scope (`repo:status` and `public_repo`\nsubscopes, to be precise).\n\nAdditional environment variables may be required when publishing to specific\ntargets (e.g. `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` for PyPI target).\n\n### Environment Files\n\n`craft` will read configuration variables (keys, tokens, etc.) from the\nfollowing locations:\n\n- `$HOME/.craft.env`\n- `$PROJECT_DIR/.craft.env`\n- the shell\'s environment\n\nwhere `$HOME` is the current user\'s home directory, and `$PROJECT_DIR` is the\ndirectory where `.craft.yml` is located.\n\nThese locations will be checked in the order specified above, with values\nfound in one location overwriting anything found in previous locations. In other\nwords, environment variables will take precedence over either configuration\nfile, and the project-specific file will take precedence over the file in\n`$HOME`.\n\nThe env files must be written in shell (`sh`/`bash`) format.\nLeading `export` is allowed.\n\nExample:\n\n```shell\n# ~/.craft.env\nGITHUB_TOKEN=token123\nexport NUGET_API_TOKEN=abcdefgh\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n### `craft prepare`: Preparing a New Release\n\nThis command will create a new release branch, check the changelog entries,\nrun a version-bumping script, and push this branch to GitHub. We expect\nthat CI triggered by pushing this branch will result in release artifacts\nbeing built and uploaded to the artifact provider you wish to use during the\nsubsequent `publish` step.\n\n```shell\ncraft prepare NEW-VERSION\n\n\xf0\x9f\x9a\xa2 Prepare a new release branch\n\nPositionals:\n  NEW-VERSION  The new version you want to release           [string] [required]\n\nOptions:\n  --no-input       Suppresses all user prompts                  [default: false]\n  --dry-run        Dry run mode: do not perform any real actions\n  --log-level      Logging level\n          [choices: ""Fatal"", ""Error"", ""Warn"", ""Log"", ""Info"", ""Success"", ""Debug"",\n                                 ""Trace"", ""Silent"", ""Verbose""] [default: ""Info""]\n  --rev, -r        Source revision (git SHA or tag) to prepare from (if not\n                   branch head)                                         [string]\n  --no-push        Do not push the release branch     [boolean] [default: false]\n  --no-git-checks  Ignore local git changes and unsynchronized remotes\n                                                      [boolean] [default: false]\n  --no-changelog   Do not check for changelog entries [boolean] [default: false]\n  --publish        Run ""publish"" right after ""release""[boolean] [default: false]\n  --remote         The git remote to use when pushing\n                                                    [string] [default: ""origin""]\n  -v, --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]\n  -h, --help       Show help                                           [boolean]\n```\n\n### `craft publish`: Publishing the Release\n\nThe command will find a release branch for the provided version. The normal flow\nis for this release branch to be created automatically by `craft prepare`, but\nthat\'s not strictly necessary. Then, it subscribes to the latest status checks on\nthat branch. Once the checks pass, it downloads the release artifacts from the\nartifact provider configured in `.craft.yml` and uploads them to the targets named\non the command line (and pre-configured in `.craft.yml`).\n\n```shell\ncraft publish NEW-VERSION\n\n\xf0\x9f\x9b\xab Publish artifacts\n\nPositionals:\n  NEW-VERSION  Version to publish                            [string] [required]\n\nOptions:\n  --no-input         Suppresses all user prompts                [default: false]\n  --dry-run          Dry run mode: do not perform any real actions\n  --log-level        Logging level\n          [choices: ""Fatal"", ""Error"", ""Warn"", ""Log"", ""Info"", ""Success"", ""Debug"",\n                                 ""Trace"", ""Silent"", ""Verbose""] [default: ""Info""]\n  --target, -t       Publish to this target\n    [string] [choices: ""npm"", ""gcs"", ""registry"", ""docker"", ""github"", ""gh-pages"",\n                                                 ""all"", ""none""] [default: ""all""]\n  --rev, -r          Source revision (git SHA or tag) to publish (if not release\n                     branch head)                                       [string]\n  --no-merge         Do not merge the release branch after publishing\n                                                      [boolean] [default: false]\n  --keep-branch      Do not remove release branch after merging it\n                                                      [boolean] [default: false]\n  --keep-downloads   Keep all downloaded files        [boolean] [default: false]\n  --no-status-check  Do not check for build status    [boolean] [default: false]\n  -v, --version      Show version number                               [boolean]\n  -h, --help         Show help                                         [boolean]\n```\n\n### Example\n\nLet\'s imagine we want to release a new version of our package, and the version\nin question is `1.2.3`.\n\nWe run `prepare` command first:\n\n`$ craft prepare 1.2.3`\n\nAfter some basic sanity checks this command creates a new release branch\n`release/1.2.3`, runs the version-bumping script (`scripts/bump-version.sh`),\ncommits the changes made by the script, and then pushes the new branch to\nGitHub. At this point CI systems kick in, and the results of those builds, as\nwell as built artifacts (binaries, NPM archives, Python wheels) are gradually\nuploaded to GitHub.\n\nTo publish the built artifacts we run `publish`:\n\n`$ craft publish 1.2.3`\n\nThis command will find our release branch (`release/1.2.3`), check the build\nstatus of the respective git revision in GitHub, and then publish available\nartifacts to configured targets (for example, to GitHub and NPM in the case of\nCraft).\n\n## Configuration File: `.craft.yml`\n\nProject configuration for `craft` is stored in `.craft.yml` configuration file,\nlocated in the project root.\n\n### GitHub project\n\nCraft tries to determine the GitHub repo information from the local git repo and\nits remotes configuration. However, since `publish` command does not require a\nlocal git checkout, you may want to hard-code this information into the\nconfiguration itself:\n\n```yaml\ngithub:\n  owner: getsentry\n  repo: sentry-javascript\n```\n\n### Pre-release Command\n\nThis command will run on your newly created release branch as part of `prepare`\ncommand. By default, it is set to `bash scripts/bump-version.sh`. Please refer\nto the [Pre-release version bumping script conventions section](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions)\nfor more details.\n\n```yaml\npreReleaseCommand: bash scripts/bump-version.sh\n```\n\n### Post-release Command\n\nThis command will run after a successful `publish`. By default, it is set to\n`bash scripts/post-release.sh`. It will _not_ error if the default script is\nmissing though, as this may not be needed by all projects. Please refer to the\n[Post-release script conventions section](#post-release-script-conventions)\nfor more details.\n\n```yaml\npostReleaseCommand: bash scripts/post-release.sh\n```\n\n### Release Branch Name\n\nThis overrides the prefix for the release branch name. The full branch name used\nfor a release is `{releaseBranchPrefix}/{version}`. The prefix defaults to\n`""release""`.\n\n```yaml\nreleaseBranchPrefix: publish\n```\n\n### Changelog Policies\n\n`craft` can help you to maintain change logs for your projects. At the moment,\n`craft` supports two approaches: `simple`, and `auto` to changelog management.\n\nIn `simple` mode, `craft prepare` will remind you to add a changelog entry to the\nchangelog file (`CHANGELOG.md` by default).\n\nIn `auto` mode, `craft prepare` will use the following logic:\n\n1. If there\'s already an entry for the given version, use that\n2. Else if there is an entry named `Unreleased`, rename that to the given\n   version\n3. Else, create a new section for the version and populate it with the changes\n   since the last version. It uses [GitHub\n   Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)\n   to provide a concise and rich changelog. If the PRs are associated with a\n   milestone, the milestone title and description are used as the changelog\n   entry alongside a brief list of associated PRs. Any individual commits and\n   PRs are listed under the ""Various improvements & fixes"" section at the\n   bottom. Check out [Craft\'s own\n   releases](https://github.com/getsentry/craft/releases/) as example.\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option            | Description                                                                                |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `changelog`       | **optional**. Path to the changelog file. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md`                       |\n| `changelogPolicy` | **optional**. Changelog management mode (`none`, `simple`, or `auto`). Defaults to `none`. |\n\n**Example (`simple`):**\n\n```yaml\nchangelog: CHANGES\nchangelogPolicy: simple\n```\n\n**Valid changelog example:**\n\n```text\n## 1.3.5\n\n* Removed something\n\n## 1.3.4\n\n* Added something\n```\n\n**Example (`auto`):**\n\n```yaml\nchangelog: CHANGES\nchangelogPolicy: auto\n```\n\n**Changelog with staged changes example:**\n\n```text\n## Unreleased\n\n* Removed something\n\n## 1.3.4\n\n* Added something\n```\n\nAdditionally, `.craft.yml` is used for listing targets where you want to\npublish your new release.\n\n### Minimal Version\n\nIt is possible to specify minimal `craft` version that is required to work with\nyour configuration.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nminVersion: \'0.5.0\'\n```\n\n### Required Files\n\nYou can provide a list of patterns for files that _have to be_ available before\nproceeding with publishing. In other words, for every pattern in the given list\nthere has to be a file present that matches that pattern. This might be helpful\nto ensure that we\'re not trying to do an incomplete release.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nrequireNames:\n  - /^sentry-craft.*\\.tgz$/\n  - /^gh-pages.zip$/\n```\n\n## Status Provider\n\nYou can configure which status providers `craft` will use to check for your build status.\nBy default, it will use GitHub but you can add more providers if needed.\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option   | Description                                                                                        |\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`   | Name of the status provider: only `github` (default) for now.                                      |\n| `config` | In case of `github`: may include `contexts` key that contains a list of required contexts (checks) |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nstatusProvider:\n  name: github\n  config:\n    contexts:\n      - Travis CI - Branch\n```\n\n## Artifact Provider\n\nYou can configure which artifact providers `craft` will use to fetch artifacts from.\nBy default, GitHub is used, but in case you don\'t need use any artifacts in your\nproject, you can set it to `none`.\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option | Description                                                         |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name` | Name of the artifact provider: `github` (default), `gcs`, or `none` |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\nartifactProvider:\n  name: none\n```\n\n## Target Configurations\n\nThe configuration specifies which release targets to run for the repository. To\nrun more targets, list the target identifiers under the `targets` key in\n`.craft.yml`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: npm\n  - name: github\n  - name: registry\n    id: browser\n    type: sdk\n    onlyIfPresent: /^sentry-browser-.*\\.tgz$/\n    includeNames: /\\.js$/\n    checksums:\n      - algorithm: sha384\n        format: base64\n    config:\n      canonical: \'npm:@sentry/browser\'\n  - name: registry\n    id: node\n    type: sdk\n    onlyIfPresent: /^sentry-node-.*\\.tgz$/\n    config:\n      canonical: \'npm:@sentry/node\'\n```\n\n### Per-target options\n\nThe following options can be applied to every target individually:\n\n| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `includeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: only matched files will be processed by the target. There is one special case that `includeNames` supports.                                                          |\n| `excludeNames` | **optional**. Regular expression: the matched files will be skipped by the target. Matching is performed after testing for inclusion (via `includeNames`).                                             |\n| `id`           | **optional**. A unique id for the target type so one can refer to that target individually with the `-t` option with the `publish` command like `-t registry[browser]`. (see the example config above) |\n\nIf neither option is included, all artifacts for the release will be processed by the target.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: github\n    includeNames: /^.*\\.exe$/\n    excludeNames: /^test.exe$/\n```\n\n### GitHub (`github`)\n\nCreate a release on Github. If a Markdown changelog is present in the\nrepository, this target tries to read the release name and description from the\nchangelog. Otherwise, defaults to the tag name and tag\'s commit message.\n\nIf `previewReleases` is set to `true` (which is the default), the release\ncreated on GitHub will be marked as a pre-release version if the release name\ncontains any one of `preview`, `pre`, `rc`, `dev`,`alpha`, `beta`, `unstable`,\n`a`, or `b`.\n\n**Environment**\n\n| Name           | Description                                                        |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (see https://github.com/settings/tokens) |\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option            | Description                                                                                      |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `tagPrefix`       | **optional**. Prefix for new git tags (e.g. ""v""). Empty by default.                              |\n| `previewReleases` | **optional**. Automatically detect and create preview releases. `true` by default.               |\n| `tagOnly`         | **optional**. If set to `true`, only create a tag (without a GitHub release).`false` by default. |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: github\n    tagPrefix: v\n    previewReleases: false\n```\n\n### NPM (`npm`)\n\nReleases an NPM package to the public registry. This requires a package tarball\ngenerated by `npm pack` in the artifacts. The file will be uploaded to the\nregistry with `npm publish`, or with `yarn publish` if `npm` is not found. This\nrequires NPM to be authenticated with sufficient permissions to publish the package.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe `npm` utility must be installed on the system.\n\n| Name                | Description                                                         |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `NPM_TOKEN`         | An [automation token][npm-automation-token] allowed to publish.     |\n| `NPM_BIN`           | **optional**.

Visibility for scoped packages: `restricted` (default) or `public` |\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: npm\n    access: public\n```\n\n### Python Package Index (`pypi`)\n\nUploads source dists and wheels to the Python Package Index via [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).\nThe source code bundles and/or wheels must be in the release assets.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe `twine` Python package must be installed on the system.\n\n| Name             | Description                                           |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| `TWINE_USERNAME` | User name for PyPI with access rights for the package |\n| `TWINE_PASSWORD` | Password for the PyPI user                            |\n| `TWINE_BIN`      | **optional**. Path to twine. Defaults to `twine`      |\n\n**Configuration**\n\n_none_\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: pypi\n```\n\n### Sentry internal PyPI (`sentry-pypi`)\n\nCreates a GitHub pull request to import the package into a repo set up\nlike [getsentry/pypi]\n\n[getsentry/pypi]: https://github.com/getsentry/pypi\n\n**Environment**\n\n| Name           | Description                                                        |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (see https://github.com/settings/tokens) |\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option             | Description                          |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |\n| `internalPypiRepo` | GitHub repo containing pypi metadata |\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: pypi\n  - name: sentry-pypi\n    internalPypiRepo: getsentry/pypi\n```\n\n### Homebrew (`brew`)\n\nPushes a new or updated homebrew formula to a brew tap repository. The formula\nis committed directly to the master branch of the tap on GitHub, therefore the\nbot needs rights to commit to `master` on that repository. Therefore, formulas\non `homebrew/core` are not supported, yet.\n\nThe tap is configured with the mandatory `tap` parameter in the same format as\nthe `brew` utility. A tap `<org>/<name>` will expand to the GitHub repository\n`github.com:<org>/homebrew-<name>`.\n\nThe formula contents are given as configuration value and can be interpolated\nwith Mustache template syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context\ncontains the following variables:\n\n- `version`: The new version\n- `revision`: The tag\'s commit SHA\n- `checksums`: A map containing sha256 checksums for every release asset. Use\n  the full filename to access the sha, e.g. `checksums.MyProgram-x86`\n\n**Environment**\n\n| Name           | Description                                                        |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal GitHub API token (seeh ttps://github.com/settings/tokens) |\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option     | Description                                                        |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `tap`      | The name of the homebrew tap used to access the GitHub repo        |\n| `template` | The template for contents of the formula file (ruby code)          |\n| `formula`  | **optional**.

Strips `devDependencies` from crates before publishing. This is useful if a workspace crate uses circular dependencies for docs. Requires [`cargo-hack`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack#readme) installed. Defaults to `false`. |\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: crates\n    noDevDeps: false\n```\n\n### Google Cloud Storage (`gcs`)\n\nUploads artifacts to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.\n\nThe bucket paths (`paths`) can be interpolated using Mustache syntax (`{{ variable }}`). The interpolation context contains the following variables:\n\n- `version`: The new project version\n- `revision`: The SHA revision of the new version\n\n**Environment**\n\nGoogle Cloud credentials can be provided using either of the following two environment variables.\n\n| Name                          | Description                                                              |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH` | Local filesystem path to Google Cloud credentials (service account file) |\n| `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` | Full service account file contents, as a JSON string                     |\n\nIf defined, `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` will be preferred over `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH`.\n\n_Note:_ `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_TARGET_CREDS_PATH` were formerly called `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` and `CRAFT_GCS_CREDENTIALS_PATH`, respectively. While those names will continue to work for the foreseeable future, you\'ll receive a warning encouraging you to switch to the new names.\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `bucket`         | The name of the GCS bucket where artifacts are uploaded.                                                                                                                                              |\n| `paths`          | A list of path objects that represent bucket paths.                                                                                                                                                   |\n| `paths.path`     | Template-aware bucket path, which can contain `{{ version }}` and/or `{{ revision }}`.                                                                                                                |\n| `paths.metadata` | **optional** [Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/insert#request_properties_JSON) for uploaded files.

Thus, it can be used to publish documentation\nor any other assets to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so they will be later automatically rendered\nby GitHub.\n\nBy default, this target will look for an artifact named `gh-pages.zip`, extract it,\nand commit its contents to `gh-pages` branch.\n\n_WARNING!_ The destination branch will be completely overwritten by the contents\nof the archive.\n\n**Environment**\n\n_none_\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option        | Description                                                                             |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `branch`      | **optional** The name of the branch to push the changes to. `gh-pages` by default.      |\n| `githubOwner` | **optional** GitHub project owner, defaults to the value from the global configuration. |\n| `githubRepo`  | **optional** GitHub project name, defaults to the value from the global configuration.  |\n\n**Example**\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  - name: gh-pages\n    branch: gh-pages\n```\n\n### Sentry Release Registry (`registry`)\n\nThe target will update the Sentry release registry repo(https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-release-registry/) with the latest version of the\nproject `craft` is used with. The release registry repository will be checked out\nlocally, and then the new version file will be created there, along with the necessary\nsymbolic links.\n\nTwo package types are supported: ""sdk"" and ""app"". Type ""sdk"" means that the package\nis uploaded to one of the public registries (PyPI, NPM, Nuget, etc.), and that\nthe corresponding package directory can be found inside ""packages"" directory of the\nrelease regsitry. Type ""app"" indicates that the package\'s version files are located\nin ""apps"" directory of the registry.\n\nIt is strongly discouraged to have multiple `registry` targets in a config as it\nsupports grouping/batching multiple apps and SDKs in a single target.\n\n**Environment**\n\n_none_\n\n**Configuration**\n\n| Option                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `apps`                         | List of `app` configs as a dict, keyed by their canonical names (example: `app:craft`)                                                                                                                                                     |\n| `sdks`                         | List of `sdk` configs as a dict, keyed by their canonical names (example: `maven:io.sentry:sentry`)                                                                                                                                        |\n| `(sdks\\|apps).urlTemplate`     | **optional** URL template that will be used to generate download links for ""app"" package type.                                                                                                                                             |\n| `(sdks\\|apps).linkPrereleases` | **optional** Update package versions even if the release is a preview release, ""false"" by default.                                                                                                                                         |\n| `(sdks\\|apps).checksums`       | **optional** A list of checksums that will be computed for matched files (see `includeNames`).

No release\nassets are required for this target except for the source image at the provided\nsource image location so it would be a good idea to add a status check that\nensures the source image exists, otherwise `craft publish` will fail at the\n`docker pull` step, causing an interrupted publish. This is an issue for other,\nnon-idempotent targets, not for the Docker target.\n\n**Environment**\n\n`docker` executable (or something equivalent) must be installed on the system.\n\n| Name              | Description                                |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | The username for the Docker registry.      |\n| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | The personal access token for the account. |\n| `DOCKER_BIN`      | **optional**.

Set up a workflow that builds your assets and runs your tests. Allow building\n   release branches (their names follow `release/{VERSION}` by default,\n   configurable through `releaseBranchPrefix`).\n\n   ```yaml\n   on:\n     push:\n       branches:\n         - \'release/**\'\n   ```\n\n2. Use the official `actions/upload-artifact@v2` action to upload your assets.\n   Here is an example config (step) of an archive job:\n\n   ```yaml\n   - name: Archive Artifacts\n     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n     with:\n       name: ${{ github.sha }}\n       path: |\n         ${{ github.workspace }}/*.tgz\n         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/tracing/build/**\n         ${{ github.workspace }}/packages/**/*.tgz\n   ```\n\n   A few important things to note:\n\n   - The name of the artifacts is very important and needs to be `name: ${{ github.sha }}`. Craft uses this as a unique id to fetch the artifacts.\n   - Keep in mind that this action maintains the folder structure and zips everything together. Craft will download the zip and recursively walk it to find all assets.\n\n3. Add `.craft.yml` configuration file to your project\n\n   - List there all the targets you want to publish to\n   - Configure additional options (changelog management policy, tag prefix, etc.)\n\n4. Add a [pre-release script](#pre-release-version-bumping-script-conventions) to your project.\n5. Get various [configuration tokens](#global-configuration)\n6. Run `craft prepare <version> --publish` and profit!\n\n## Pre-release (Version-bumping) Script: Conventions\n\nAmong other actions, `craft prepare` runs an external, project-specific command\nor script that is responsible for version bumping. By default, this script\nshould be located at: `./scripts/bump-version.sh`. The command can be configured\nby specifying the `preReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.\n\nThe following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:\n\n- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old (""from"")\n  version and the new (""to"") version as the last two arguments, respectively.\n- The script must replace all relevant occurrences of the old version string\n  with the new one.\n- The script must not commit the changes made.\n- The script must not change the state of the git repository (e.g. changing branches)\n\n**Example**\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n### Example of a version-bumping script for an NPM project.\n### Located at: ./scripts/bump-version.sh\nset -eux\nOLD_VERSION=""${1}""\nNEW_VERSION=""${2}""\n\n# Do not tag and commit changes made by ""npm version""\nexport npm_config_git_tag_version=false\nnpm version ""${NEW_VERSION}""\n```\n\n## Post-release Script: Conventions\n\nAmong other actions, `craft publish` runs an external, project-specific command\nor script that can do things like bumping the development version. By default,\nthis script should be located at: `./scripts/post-release.sh`. Unlike the\npre-release command, this script is not mandatory so if the file does not exist,\n`craft` will report this fact and then move along as usual. This command can be\nconfigured by specifying `postReleaseCommand` configuration option in `craft.yml`.\n\nThe following requirements are on the script interface and functionality:\n\n- The script should accept at least two arguments. Craft will pass the old (""from"")\n  version and the new (""to"") version as the last two arguments, respectively.\n- The script is responsible for any and all `git` state management as `craft` will\n  simply exit after running this script as the final step. This means the script\n  is responsible for committing and pushing any changes that it may have made.\n\n**Example**\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n### Example of a dev-version-bumping script for a Python project\n### Located at: ./scripts/post-release.sh\nset -eux\nOLD_VERSION=""${1}""\nNEW_VERSION=""${2}""\n\n# Ensure master branch\ngit checkout master\n# Advance the CalVer release by one-month and add the `.dev0` suffix\n./scripts/bump-version.sh \'\' $(date -d ""$(echo $NEW_VERSION | sed -e \'s/^\\([0-9]\\{2\\}\\)\\.\\([0-9]\\{1,2\\}\\)\\.[0-9]\\+$/20\\1-\\2-1/\') 1 month"" +%y.%-m.0.dev0)\n# Only commit if there are changes, make sure to `pull --rebase` before pushing to avoid conflicts\ngit diff --quiet || git commit -anm \'meta: Bump new development version\' && git pull --rebase && git push\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Logging Level\n\nLogging level for `craft` can be configured via setting the `CRAFT_LOG_LEVEL`\nenvironment variable or using the `--log-level` CLI flag.\n\nAccepted values are: `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Log`, `Info`, `Success`,\n`Debug`, `Trace`, `Silent`, `Verbose`\n\n### Dry-run Mode\n\nDry-run mode can be enabled via setting the `CRAFT_DRY_RUN` environment variable\nto any truthy value (any value other than `undefined`, `null`, `""""`, `0`,\n`false`, and `no`). One may also use the `--dry-run` CLI flag.\n\nIn dry-run mode no destructive actions will be performed (creating remote\nbranches, pushing tags, committing files, etc.)\n\n### Sentry Support\n\nErrors you encounter while using Craft can be sent to Sentry. To use this\nfeature, add `CRAFT_SENTRY_DSN` variable to your environment (or ""craft""\nconfiguration file) that contains a Sentry project\'s DSN.\n\nFor example:\n\n```shell\nexport CRAFT_SENTRY_DSN=\'https://1234@sentry.io/2345\'\n```\n\n### Releasing\n\n`craft` obviously uses `craft` for preparing and publishing new releases!\n\n[_Did you mean **recursion**?_](#craft-prepare-preparing-a-new-release)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Defaults to\n  lower-cased repository name.\n\n* `formula-path`: the relative path of the Homebrew formula file to edit within the `homebrew-tap` repository. Defaults to\n  `Formula/<formula-name>.rb`.\n\n* `tag-name`: the git tag name to bump the formula to. Defaults to the\n  currently pushed tag.\n\n* `download-url`: the package download URL for the Homebrew formula.\n\n  Defaults to `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/archive/<tag-name>.tar.gz`, where `OWNER/REPO` is the repository that is running the Actions workflow.\n\n* `download-sha256`: the SHA256 checksum of the archive at `download-url`.\n  Defaults to calculating the checksum by fetching the archive at run time.\n\nRepository parameters:\n\n* `homebrew-tap`: the full GitHub repository name (in the `NAME/OWNER` format) where the Homebrew formula should be updated. Defaults\n  to `Homebrew/homebrew-core`.\n\n* `push-to`: a specific fork of `homebrew-tap` where the edit should be pushed to. Defaults to creating or reusing a personal fork of the owner of COMMITTER_TOKEN.\n\n* `base-branch`: the branch name in the `homebrew-tap` repository where the\n  formula should be updated. Defaults to the main branch of the repository.\n\n* `create-pullrequest`: a boolean value to either force or prohibit submitting\n  a pull request to `homebrew-tap`. Defaults to false if `COMMITTER_TOKEN` has\n  the privileges to directly push to `base-branch` in `homebrew-tap`.\n\n* `commit-message`: the git commit message template to use when updating the\n  formula. The following placeholders be expanded:\n\n  | Placeholder       | Description                                        |\n  | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n  | `{{formulaName}}` | the name of the formula supplied in `formula-name` |\n  | `{{version}}`     | the version number for this release                |\n\n  It\'s recommended that `commit-message` has _both subject and body_, i.e. that\n  it contains a subject line followed by a blank line followed by body text.\n  Otherwise, pull requests to `Homebrew/homebrew-core` might get denied by\n  their automation.\n\n  Defaults to:\n  ```\n  {{formulaName}} {{version}}\n\n  Created by https://github.com/mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action\n  ```\n\n\n## How it works\n\nGiven a Homebrew formula `Formula/my_formula.rb` in the\n[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) repo:\n\n```rb\nclass MyFormula < Formula\n  url ""https://github.com/me/myproject/archive/v1.2.3.tar.gz""\n  sha256 ""<OLDSHA>""\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nAfter we push a `v2.0.0` git tag to a project that has this action configured,\nthe formula will be updated to:\n\n```rb\nclass MyFormula < Formula\n  url ""https://github.com/me/myproject/archive/v2.0.0.tar.gz""\n  sha256 ""<NEWSHA>""\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nThis action can update the following Homebrew formula fields:\n\n- `version`\n- `url`\n- `sha256` - for non-git `download-url`\n- `tag` - for git-based `download-url`\n- `revision` - for git-based `download-url`\n\nIf the current `COMMITTER_TOKEN` doesn\'t have push access to the repo specified\nby the `homebrew-tap` input, the formula will be edited in a fork that is\nautomatically created, and a pull request will be opened.\n\nIf the token has push access, but the default branch of the tap repo is\nprotected, a pull request will be opened from a new branch in the same repo.\n\nOtherwise, the formula will be edited via a direct push to the default branch.\nThis can be overriden by setting `create-pullrequest`.\n\n\n## Manual trigger\n\nHere\'s an example of how to set up this action to be manually triggered instead\nof being triggered by pushing to a git tag:\n\n```yml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      tag-name:\n        description: \'The git tag name to bump the formula to\'\n        required: true\n\njobs:\n  homebrew:\n    name: Bump Homebrew formula\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action@v2\n        with:\n          formula-name: my_formula\n          tag-name: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag-name }}\n          download-url: https://example.com/foo/${{ github.event.inputs.tag-name }}.tar.gz\n        env:\n          COMMITTER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COMMITTER_TOKEN }}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This\n  can be a fully specified verison `2.0.0`, partly specified `1.2`, a wildcard\n  version `1.2.x`. By default it is empty which will give the latest bazel\n  version available on GitHub.\n\n  The version can also be `latest` to get the latest version of bazel on GitHub.\n\n  The [version tests] show some expected values for given versions.\n\n* `github-api-token` is optional, but is used to authenticate with GitHub's\n  API. This will default to the generated GitHub token for the pipeline but can\n  be overridden. If set to blank then no authentication is used to access the\n  API and there is a chance that the test runner will have hit the API rate\n  limit causing the action to fail to download the available versions from\n  GitHub.\n\n  See also:\n   - [GitHub API rate limiting]\n   - [GITHUB_TOKEN]\n\n\n### How it works\n\nThe action will download the list of releases of bazel available on GitHub and\nchoose the best match for the test runner's platform and the version\nrequirements given as as option.

299,"b'# Auto Approve GitHub Action\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n\n**Name:** `hmarr/auto-approve-action`\n\nAutomatically approve GitHub pull requests.\n\n**Important:** use v3 or later, as v2 uses Node.js 12, which is deprecated. If you\'re on an old version of GHES (earlier than 3.4) you may need to use v2 until you can upgrade. v1 was designed for the initial GitHub Actions beta, and no longer works.\n\n## Usage instructions\n\nCreate a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml`) that contains a step that `uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3`. Here\'s an example workflow file:\n\n```yaml\nname: Auto approve\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3\n```\n\nCombine with an `if` clause to only auto-approve certain users. For example, to auto-approve [Dependabot][dependabot] pull requests, use:\n\n```yaml\nname: Auto approve\n\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  auto-approve:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    if: github.actor == \'dependabot[bot]\'\n    steps:\n      - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3\n```\n\nIf you want to use this action from a workflow file that doesn\'t run on the `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` events, use the `pull-request-number` input:\n\n```yaml\nname: Auto approve\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs: \n      pullRequestNumber:\n        description: Pull request number to auto-approve\n        required: false\n\njobs:\n  auto-approve:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    steps:\n    - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3\n      with:\n        pull-request-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.pullRequestNumber }}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can provide a message for the review:\n\n```yaml\nname: Auto approve\n\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  auto-approve:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      pull-requests: write\n    if: github.actor == \'dependabot[bot]\'\n    steps:\n      - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3\n        with:\n          review-message: ""Auto approved automated PR""\n```\n\n### Approving on behalf of a different user\n\nBy default, this will use the [automatic GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) that\'s provided to the workflow. This means the approval will come from the ""github-actions"" bot user. Make sure you enable the `pull-requests: write` permission in your workflow.\n\nTo approve the pull request as a different user, pass a GitHub Personal Access Token into the `github-token` input. In order to approve the pull request, the token needs the `repo` scope enabled.\n\n```yaml\nname: Auto approve\n\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  auto-approve:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{ secrets.SOME_USERS_PAT }}\n```\n\n### Approving Dependabot pull requests\n\nWhen a workflow is run in response to a Dependabot pull request using the `pull_request` event, the workflow won\'t have access to secrets. If you\'re trying to use a Personal Access Token (as above) but getting an error on Dependabot pull requests, this is probably why.\n\nFortunately the fix is simple: use the `pull_request_target` event instead of `pull_request`. This runs the workflow in the context of the base branch of the pull request, which does have access to secrets.\n\n## Why?\n\nGitHub lets you prevent merges of unapproved pull requests. However, it\'s occasionally useful to selectively circumvent this restriction - for instance, some people want Dependabot\'s automated pull requests to not require approval.\n\n[dependabot]: https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot\n\n## Code owners\n\nIf you\'re using a [CODEOWNERS file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners), you\'ll need to give this action a personal access token for a user listed as a code owner. Rather than using a real user\'s personal access token, you\'re probably better off creating a dedicated bot user, and adding it to a team which you assign as the code owner. That way you can restrict the bot user\'s permissions as much as possible, and your workflow won\'t break when people leave the team.\n\n## Development and release process\n\nEach major version corresponds to a branch (e.g. `v2`, `v3`). The latest major version (`v3` at the time of writing) is the repository\'s default branch. Releases are tagged with semver-style version numbers (e.g. `v1.2.3`).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Can be used in combination with `extra_plugins`.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Checkout\n    uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - name: Semantic Release\n    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3\n    with:\n      # You can extend an existing shareable configuration.\n      # And you can specify version range for the shareable configuration if you prefer.\n      extends: |\n        @semantic-release/apm-config@^9.0.0\n        @mycompany/override-config\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n#### working_directory\nThis action run semantic release in the github provided workspace by default. You can override it by setting another working directory.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Checkout\n    uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - name: Semantic Release\n    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3\n    with:\n      # You can select another working directory like a subdirectory for example.\n      working_directory: ./code\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n#### tag_format\nThe default tag format on semantic-release is `v{version}`. You can override that behavior using this option (helpful when you are using monorepos)\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Checkout\n    uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - name: Semantic Release\n    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3\n    with:\n      tag_format: custom-v${version}\n    env:\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Outputs\n|     Output Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                       |\n|:-------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   new_release_published   | Whether a new release was published.

If your host allows or requires ssh please use my [web-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/web-deploy) action\n- Some web hosts change the default port (21), check with your host for your port number\n\n---\n\n### Setup Steps\n1. Select the repository you want to add the action to\n2. Select the `Actions` tab\n3. Select `Blank workflow file` or `Set up a workflow yourself`, if you don\'t see these options manually create a yaml file `Your_Project/.github/workflows/main.yml`\n4. Paste the example above into your yaml file and save\n5. Now you need to add a key to the `secrets` section in your project. To add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`. Add a new `Secret` for `password`\n6. Update your yaml file settings\n7. If you appreciate this github action give it a :star: or show off with one of the [badges below](#badge).\n\n---\n\n### Settings\nKeys can be added directly to your .yml config file or referenced from your project `Secrets` storage.\n\nTo add a `secret` go to the `Settings` tab in your project then select `Secrets`.\nI strongly recommend you store your `password` as a secret.\n\n| Key Name

If you customize the `exclude` option make sure you re-add the default options.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>How to exclude a specific file or folder</summary>\n\nYou can use the `exclude` option to ignore specific files/folders from the publish. Keep in mind you will need to re-add the default exclude options if you want to keep them. For example the below option excludes all `.txt` files.\n\n```yml\nexclude:\n - *.txt\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>How do I set a upload timeout?</summary>\n\ngithub has a built-in `timeout-minutes` option, see customized example below\n\n```yaml\non: push\nname: Publish Website\njobs:\n  web-deploy:\n    name: web-deploy\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    timeout-minutes: 15 # time out after 15 minutes (default is 360 minutes)\n    steps:\n      ....\n```\n</details>\n\n## Debugging your config locally\nThis action is a basic wrapper around my `@samkirkland/ftp-deploy` npm package. To test your config you can install [@samkirkland/ftp-deploy](https://github.com/SamKirkland/ftp-deploy) and then convert your config to a yml action. Settings are one-to-one, this action is only a wrapper.\n\n## Contributing to this project\nTo test this action locally you will need to setup **docker** and **act** to run a environment similar to the one github uses for actions.\n- Download/install docker for windows, make sure it is running\n- `choco install act-cli` install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)\n- Install the npm package using `npm install --dev-only @samkirkland/ftp-deploy`\n- Update the `deploy` script in `package.json` with a actual server/username/password\n- You can run the script using the following command `npm run deploy` (run this in the folder that has the `package.json` file)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If a `cache-miss` occurs, it downloads and caches the tools right away.\n\nWorks for `x64` and `arm64` hosts on Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nThe desired version can be specified using [semantic versioning ranges](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning), and also use `install` or `installrc` special tokens to install resp. the [latest stable](./.latest_cmake_version) or [release candidate](./.latestrc_cmake_version).\n\nThere are two kind of caches:\n- The cloud based [GitHub cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache). Enabled by default, it can be disabled using the input `useCloudCache:false`. \n- The local self-hosted runner cache, stored locally using [tool-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/tool-cache). Disabled by default, it can enabled with the input `useLocalCache:true`. \n\n\nSteps of `get-cmake`:\n  1. If a `cache-hit` occurs (either local or cloud cache), CMake and Ninja are restored from the cache.\n     1. if both local and cloud are enabled, the local cache check goes first.\n  2. If a `cache-miss` occurs, i.e. none of the enabled caches hits:\n     1. the action downloads and installs the desired versions of CMake and Ninja.\n     2. the action stores CMake and Ninja for the enabled caches:\n        1. if enabled, on the [cloud based GitHub cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache). This is beneficial for the next run of the workflow especially on _GitHub-hosted runners_.\n        2. if enabled, on the local GitHub runner cache. This is beneficial for the next run of the workflow on the same _self-hosted runner_.\n        \n        _Note:_ when there is a `cache-hit`, nothing will be stored in any of the caches.\n  3. Adds to the `PATH` environment variable the binary directories for CMake and Ninja.\n  \n<br>\n\n## Quickstart\n### If you want to use  **latest stable** you can use this one-liner:\n```yaml\n  # Option 1: using \'latest\' branch, the most recent CMake and ninja are installed.\n    - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest  # <--= Just this one-liner suffices.\n```\nThe local and cloud cache can be enabled or disabled, for example:\n```yaml\n    # Suited for self-hosted GH runners where the local cache wins over the cloud.\n    - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest  \n      with:\n        useLocalCache: true         # <--= Use the local cache (default is \'false\').\n        useCloudCache: false        # <--= Ditch the cloud cache (default is \'true\').\n```\nAnd there is a second option:\n```yaml\n  # Option 2: specify \'latest\' or \'latestrc\' in the input version arguments:\n    - name: Get latest CMake and Ninja\n      uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest\n      with:\n        cmakeVersion: latestrc      # <--= optional, use the latest release candidate (notice the \'rc\' suffix).\n        ninjaVersion: latest        # <--= optional, use the latest release (non candidate).\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### If you want to **pin** the workflow to **specific range of versions** of CMake and Ninja:\n```yaml\n  # Option 1: specify in a input parameter the desired version using ranges.\n  - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest\n    with:\n      cmakeVersion: ""~3.25.0""  # <--= optional, use most recent 3.25.x version\n      ninjaVersion: ""^1.11.1""  # <--= optional, use most recent 1.x version\n\n  # or using a specific version (no range)\n  - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest\n    with:\n      cmakeVersion: 3.25.2     # <--= optional, stick to exactly 3.25.2 version\n      ninjaVersion: 1.11.1     # <--= optional, stick to exactly 1.11.1 version\n```\nor there is another option:\n```yaml\n  # Option 2: or you can use the Git \'tag\' to select the version, and you can have a one-liner statement,\n  # but note that you can only use one of the existing tags, create a PR to add the tag you need!\n  - name: Get specific version CMake, v3.26.0\n    uses: lukka/get-cmake@v3.26.0     # <- this one-liner is all you need.\n```\n<br>\n\n## Action reference: all input/output parameters\nPlease read [action.yml](./action.yml).\n\n<br>\n\n## Who is using `get-cmake`\n[This graph](https://lukka.github.io/graph/graph.html) shows the list of public repositories with more than 25 stars using `get-cmake`.\n\n<br>\n\n# Developers information\n\n## Prerequisites\n[gulp 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp4) globally installed.\n\n<br>\n\n## Build and lint\nBuild with `tsc` running:\n\n > npm run build\n\nLaunch `lint` by:\n\n > npm run lint\n\n<br>\n\n## Generate the catalog of CMake releases\nTo generate the catalog of CMake releases, run a special test with this command:\n\n > npm run generate-catalog\n\nThen embed the new catalog by packaging the action.\n\n<br>\n\n## Packaging\nTo build, lint validate and package the extension (and embed the release catalog) for release purpose, run:\n\n  > npm run pack\n\n<br>\n\n## Testing\nTo build, pack and run all tests:\n \n > npm run test\n\n To run all tests:\n \n > npx jest\n\n or\n\n > npx jest -- -t ""&lt;regex to match the describe clause&gt;""\n\n<br>\n\n## Contributing\nThe software is provided as is, there is no warranty of any kind.

Note that usage of CMakePresets.json is required.\n\nGood companions are the [run-vcpkg](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg) action and the [get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) action.\n\nSpecial features which provide added value over a pure workflow are:\n  - annotations for `CMake` errors/warnings and for build (`gcc`/`msvc`/`clang`) errors/warnings are created inline in the changed source files the build run for, e.g.:  \n    ![Annotation](./docs/imgs/annotation.png)\n  - when necessary, it sets up the environment to build with the `MSVC` toolset.\n  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. The regex is customizable by the user.\n\nThe provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).\n\n<br>\n\n## Quickstart with instructions\n\nIt is __highly recommended__ to use:\n- a [vcpkg.json](https://vcpkg.io/en/docs/maintainers/manifest-files.html) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.\n- the required [CMakePresets.json](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) file.\n- [vcpkg as a submodule of your repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/README.md#vcpkg-as-a-submodule).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    steps:\n      #-uses: actions/cache@v3   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!\n\n      # Install latest CMake and Ninja.\n      - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest\n      # Or pin to a specific CMake version:\n      # lukka/get-cmake@v3.21.2\n\n      # Restore from cache the previously built ports.

If not set, sensible defaults will be used.\n\n### `perl-version`\n\nSpecifies the Perl version to setup.\nMinor version and patch level can be omitted.\nThe action uses the latest Perl version available that matches the specified value.\nThis defaults to `5`, which results in the latest available version of Perl 5.\nIn addition, the value `latest` is available, the actions uses the latest available version of Perl including `5`, `7` or later major versions.\n\n### `perl-version-file`\n\nSpecifies the path to the version file such as `.perl-version`.\n\n### `distribution`\n\nSpecify the distribution to use, this is either `default` or `strawberry`. (The value `strawberry` is ignored on anything but Windows.)\n\n- Default: `default`\n\n### `multi-thread`\n\nEnables interpreter-based threads (ithread) options (`-Duseithreads`). `true` and `false` are accepted.\n\n- Default: depends on platform. On Linux and macOS, the default value is ""false"" (ithread is disabled). On Windows, the default value is ""true"" (ithread is enable) for fork emulation.\n\n### `install-modules-with`\n\nInstall CPAN modules from your `cpanfile` with the specified installer.\n`cpanm`([App::cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus)), `cpm`([App::cpm](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpm)), and `carton`([Carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton)) are available.\nCPAN modules is installed into `${working-directory}/local/`.\n\n- Default: Nothing. Any CPAN module is not installed.\n\n### `install-modules-args`\n\nThe argument for CPAN module installer.\n\n- Default: Nothing\n\n### `install-modules`\n\nList of one or more CPAN modules, separated by white spaces (space or new line).\nThey are installed `local` directory on your working directory.\n\n- Default: Nothing\n\n### `enable-modules-cache`\n\nEnable caching of the `local` directory at the root of the working directory. `true` enables the cache and `false` disables it.\nThe cache key will be generated by hashing the contents of `cpanfile` in the repository root.\nThis is intended for preserving locally installed modules between builds, which reduces build times.\nSee [Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) for more information.\n\n**Warning:** If your repository does not use a `cpanfile` or if it uses a\nsubdirectory named `local` for a different purpose, you probably want to set\nthis option to `false` to prevent old files from being cached unexpectedly\nbetween builds.\n\n- Default: `true`\n\n### `working-directory`\n\nThe working directory.\n\n- Default: `.`\n\n## Action outputs\n\n### `perl-version`\n\nThe perl version actually installed. (e.g. `""5.34.0""`)\n\n### `perl-hash`\n\nThe digest of `perl -V`.\nIt is useful for the cache key, because this value vary the platform, the version of perl, the compiler option for building perl, etc.\n\n# Supported Shells\n\nThe GitHub runner come with a preinstalled version of Perl, used by the system Git. Unfortunately, some shell types prepend the directory containing the system Perl to the `PATH` which makes it impossible to use the Perl installed by this action.\n\n`shell` parameter | Linux | macOS | Windows (default) | Windows (Strawberry)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n`bash` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:<sup>1)</sup> | :x:<sup>1)</sup>\n`pwsh` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:\n`python` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:\n`sh` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | n/a | n/a\n`cmd` | n/a | n/a | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:\n`powershell` | n/a |  n/a | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:\ncustom shell `perl {0}` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:\n\n1) On Windows, the bash shell always gets `/usr/bin` prepended to the `PATH` which contains the system Perl.\n\n# Pre-installed Scripts\n\nThe following Perl scripts are pre-installed for convenience.\n\n- [carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Carton/script/carton)\n- [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm)\n- [cpm](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-cpm/script/cpm)\n\n# Pre-installed Modules\n\n## CPAN Modules\n\n- [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON)\n- [Cpanel::JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Cpanel::JSON::XS)\n- [JSON::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS)\n- [JSON::MaybeXS](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::MaybeXS)\n- [YAML](https://metacpan.org/dist/YAML/view/lib/YAML.pod)\n- [YAML::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Tiny)\n- [YAML::XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::XS)\n- [Net::SSLeay](https://metacpan.org/dist/Net-SSLeay/view/lib/Net/SSLeay.pod)\n- [IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/dist/IO-Socket-SSL/view/lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pod)\n- [Mozilla::CA](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mozilla::CA)\n- [Win32](https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32) (installed from CPAN in perl 5.8.3 or earlier.

310,"b""![build-test](https://github.com/jwgmeligmeyling/spotbugs-github-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)\n\n# SpotBugs GitHub Action\n\nThis action pushes results from [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) (or [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)) as check run annotations. :rocket:\n\nThe action can also be used for any other static analysis tools that produce reports in the SpotBugs XML format.\nThe report itself must be generated in a former build step, for example a Maven build.\n\n![example](images/example.png)\n\n## Input\n\n### `path`\nRequired. A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes where to find the reports.\nMultiple files can be processed through a [glob expression](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob), for example: `'**/spotbugsXml.xml'`.\n\n### `name`\nOptional. Name for the check run to create. Defaults to `spotbugs`.\n\n### `title`\nOptional. Title for the check run to create. Defaults to `SpotBugs Source Code Analyzer report`.\n\n### `token`\nOptional. GitHub API access token. Defaults to `${{ github.token }}`, which is set by `actions/checkout@v2` minimally.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```yaml\nname: Java CI\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Set up JDK 1.8\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v1\n      with:\n        java-version: 1.8\n    - uses: actions/cache@v1\n      with:\n        path: ~/.m2/repository\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}\n        restore-keys: |\n          ${{ runner.os }}-maven-\n    - name: Build with Maven\n      run: mvn -B verify spotbugs:spotbugs\n    - uses: jwgmeligmeyling/spotbugs-github-action@master\n      with:\n        path: '**/spotbugsXml.xml'\n```\n\nAnd do not forget to enable XML output for the Maven plugin:\n\n```xml\n<build>\n  <plugins>\n    <plugin>\n      <groupId>com.github.spotbugs</groupId>\n      <artifactId>spotbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n      <version>4.0.0</version>\n      <configuration>\n        <xmlOutput>true</xmlOutput>\n        <failOnError>false</failOnError>\n      </configuration>\n    </plugin>\n  </plugins>\n</build>\n```\n\nPlease note that by default workflows on `pull_request` events checkout [`refs/pull/:prNumber/merge`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) instead of the head of the pull request.\nDue to this, line numbers for the generated violations may not align with the actual line numbers to which they are displayed on the `HEAD`.\nAs it is, there is not really a sensible way to run this action on the merge commit of the pull request, because the result would be posted to an unnamed workflow for an otherwise invisible commit.\nEven for `pull_request` events there is the possibility to checkout the pull request head instead. In order to do so, change your `checkout` action accordingly:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  with:\n    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n```\n\n## Other relevant actions\nThis is a Github Action in a series of other GitHub Actions.

311,"b'# @check-spelling/check-spelling GitHub Action\n\n## Overview\n\nEveryone makes typos. This includes people writing documentation and comments,\nbut it also includes programmers naming variables, functions, APIs, classes,\nand filenames.\n\nOften, programmers will use `InitialCapitalization`, `camelCase`,\n`ALL_CAPS`, or `IDLCase` when naming their things. When they do this, it makes\nit much harder for naive spelling tools to recognize misspellings, and as such,\nwith a really high false-positive rate, people don\'t tend to enable spell checking\nat all.\n\nThis repository\'s tools are capable of tolerating all of those variations.\nSpecifically, [w](https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/master/w) understands\nenough about how programmers name things that it can split the above conventions\ninto word-like things for checking against a dictionary.\n\n## Spell Checker GitHub Actions\n\n[![Spell checking](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/workflows/Spell%20checking/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/actions?query=workflow:""Spell+checking""+branch:main+event:push)\n\n* [Basic Configuration](#basic-configuration)\n* [**Documentation**](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/) and [Possible features](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Possible-features)\nare listed on the [Wiki](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/)\n  * [Event descriptions](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Warnings)\n* [Configuration](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration)\n  * [Workflow variables](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#workflow-variables)\n  * [Workflows](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration:-Workflows)\n  * [Files](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#Files)\n* [Historical information](https://github.com/jsoref/spelling#overview)\n\n### Sample output\n\n#### Comment as seen in a PR\n\n![github action comment](images/check-spelling-comment.png)\n\n#### Comment as seen in a commit\n\n![github action annotation](images/check-spelling-annotation.png)\n\n#### GitHub Action Run log\n\n![github action log](images/check-spelling-log.png)\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\nJust copy the [spell-check-this](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this)\n[.github](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/tree/main/.github)\ndirectory into your project.\n\n## Running locally\n\nYes you can!\n\n### Running locally with Act\n\n1.

A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Publishing using Gradle\n```yaml\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up JDK 1.8\n      uses: actions/setup-java@v1\n\n    - name: Build with Gradle\n      run: gradle build\n\n    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages\n      run: gradle publish\n      env:\n        USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.\n\n## Apache Maven with a settings path\n\nWhen using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file.

An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n### Inputs\nFor more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)\n\n- `tag_name`: The name of the tag for this release\n- `release_name`: The name of the release\n- `body`: Text describing the contents of the release\n- `draft`: `true` to create a draft (unpublished) release, `false` to create a published one. Default: `false`\n- `prerelease`: `true` to identify the release as a prerelease. `false` to identify the release as a full release. Default `false`\n\n### Outputs\nFor more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like\n\n- `id`: The release ID\n- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`\n- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action\n\n### Example workflow - create a release\nOn every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags\n    tags:\n      - \'v*\' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10\n\nname: Create Release\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Create Release\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Create Release\n        id: create_release\n        uses: actions/create-release@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This token is provided by Actions, you do not need to create your own token\n        with:\n          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}\n          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}\n          body: |\n            Changes in this Release\n            - First Change\n            - Second Change\n          draft: false\n          prerelease: false\n```\n\nThis will create a [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases), as well as a [`release` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#releaseevent), which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action. This uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by the [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret), so no new token is needed.\n\n## Contributing\nWe would love you to contribute to `@actions/create-release`, pull requests are welcome!

Here is a code [example of a migration](https://github.com/alex-page/alexpage.dev/commit/717efbcc57d0c8ce9f64d28526263610ea444823) off this GitHub action.\n\n---\n\n# Blazing fast GitHub Pages deploy\n\n> \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 The most blazingest action to deploy your GitHub pages website\n\n\n## Why did you make another action to deploy to GitHub pages?\n\nThis GitHub action uses JavaScript for maximum speed \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80.\n> Using a [JavaScript action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action. \n\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to your project.\n2. Create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\n3.

It is recommended to build the site in a new folder for deployment.\n\n\n## Release History\n\n- v1.1.0 - Use environment variables, remove @actions/github dependency, remove TypeScript\n- v1.0.3 - Use environment variable for repository\n- v1.0.2 - Use head_commit for when there is no push\n- v1.0.1 - Return on error\n- v1.0.0 - Remove required name and email.

For example when an `issue` is `opened` create a card in the Backlog project, Triage column.\n\nIf the `pull_request` or `issue` card already exists it will be moved to the column provided. Otherwise the card will be created in the column.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a [project](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards) with columns in your repository, user profile or organisation.\n\nCreate a new workflow `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory. In the `.yml`file you have to decide what webhook events going move or create a card in a column. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file). See the examples below to get started quickly.\n\n\n### .github/workflows/opened-issues-triage.yml\n\nMove opened issues into the Triage column of the Backlog project\n\n```yml\nname: Move new issues into Triage\n\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened]\n\njobs:\n  automate-project-columns:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.3\n        with:\n          project: Backlog\n          column: Triage\n          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### .github/workflows/assigned-pulls-todo.yml\n\nAdd assigned pull requests into the To Do column of the Backlog project\n\n```yml\nname: Move assigned pull requests into To do\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [assigned]\n\njobs:\n  automate-project-columns:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@v0.8.3\n        with:\n          project: Backlog\n          column: To do\n          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Workflow options\n\nChange these options in the workflow `.yml` file to meet your GitHub project needs.\n\n| Inputs | Description | Values |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `on` | When the automation is ran | `issues` `pull_request` `issue_comment` `pull_request_target` `pull_request_review` |\n| `types` | The types of activity that will trigger a workflow run. | `opened`, `assigned`, `edited`: [See GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) for more |\n| `project` | The name of the project | `Backlog` |\n| `column` | The column to create or move the card to | `Triage` |\n| `repo-token` | The personal access token | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |\n| `action` | This determines the type of the action to be performed on the card, Default: `update` | `update`, `delete`, `archive`, `add` |\n\n## Personal access token\n\nMost of the time [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) will work as your `repo-token`. This requires no set up. If you have a public project board and public repository this is the option for you.\n\n**Repository project, private repository or organisation projects**\n\nYou will need a personal access token to send events from your issues and pull requests.\n\n1. Create a personal access token\n    1. [Public repository and repository project](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)\n    1. [Private repository or private project](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)\n    1. [Organisation project board or organisation repository](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,write:org&description=GHPROJECT_TOKEN)\n\n1. [Add a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) `GHPROJECT_TOKEN` with the personal access token.\n1. Update the `repo-token` in the workflow `.yml`  to reference your new token name:\n```yaml\nrepo-token: ${{ secrets.GHPROJECT_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**GraphqlError: Resource not accessible by integration** or **Secrets are not currently available to forks.**\n\nThis error happens on repository projects and forked repositories because [`GITHUB_TOKEN` only has read permissions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token). Create a personal access token following the instructions above.\n\n**Parameter token or opts.auth is required**\n\nThis error happens when using a personal access token to run the workflow on PRs from forked repositories. This is because [GitHub secrets are not populated for workflows triggered by forks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories-2). Use `pull_request_target` as the webhook event instead to [enable access to secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).\n\n**SAML enforcement**\n\nWith certain organisations there may be SAML enforcement. This means you will need to `Enable SSO` when you create the personal access token.\n```\nGraphqlError: Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement.

The action comes with [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo) preinstalled.  \nUses the new YML syntax.\n\n## Versions\n## Supported versions\n`php7.4`: Based on `php:7.4-cli-alpine` with [composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) and [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo)  \n`php7.3`: Based on `php:7.3-cli-alpine` with [composer](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) and [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo)  \n\n### Deprecated versions\n`0.2.0` uses a pre-built docker image [composer-prestissimo](https://github.com/nick-zh/docker-composer-prestissimo) (basing on the official composer image).\nThis improves build time (is now around 13s), since now the action only needs to pull instead of building it every time.  \n\n`0.1.1` uses the the offical [composer docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) directly and installs [hirak/prestissimo](https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo).  \nDue to this, the image is freshly built everytime (roughly 31s).\n\n## Example usage\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run composer\n    uses: nick-zh/composer-php@master\n    with:\n      action: 'install -oa'\n```\n\n""","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

330,"b'## AWS CodeBuild Run Build for GitHub Actions\n\nThis action runs a [AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] [project][codebuild project]\nas a step in a GitHub Actions workflow job.\n\nThe action builds the CodeBuild project, collects the build logs, and prints them as they are written.\nThe user experience is the same as it would be if the logic were executed\nin the GitHub Actions job runner.\n\n[Security issue notifications](./CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Inputs\n\nThis action offers three inputs that you can use to configure its behavior.\nThe only required input is `project-name`.\n\n1. **project-name** (required) : The name of CodeBuild project you want to run.\n1. **buildspec-override** (optional) :\n   The location (in this repository) of the [buildspec file][codebuild buildspec]\n   that CodeBuild requires.\n   By default, the action uses the buildspec file location\n   that you configured in the CodeBuild project. \n  \n   Alternatively, you can pass in an inline buildspec definition like so:\n\n   ```\n   - name: Run CodeBuild\n     uses: aws-actions/aws-codebuild-run-build@v1\n     with:\n       project-name: my-codebuild-job\n       disable-source-override: true\n       buildspec-override:   |\n         version: 0.2\n         phases:\n           install:\n             runtime-versions:\n               nodejs: 16\n             commands:\n               - npm install -g typescript\n               - npm install\n           pre_build:\n             commands:\n               - echo Installing source NPM dependencies...\n           build:\n             commands:\n               - echo Build started on `date`\n               - tsc\n               - npm prune --production\n             post_build:\n               commands:\n                 - echo Build completed on `date`  \n         artifacts:\n           type: zip\n           files:\n             - package.json\n             - package-lock.json\n   ```\n1. **compute-type-override** (optional) :\n   The name of a compute type for this build that overrides the one specified\n   in the build project.\n1. **environment-type-override** (optional) :\n   A container type for this build that overrides the one specified in the\n   build project.\n1. **image-override** (optional) :\n   The name of an image for this build that overrides the one specified\n   in the build project.\n1. **disable-source-override** (optional) :\n   Set to `true` if you want to disable providing `sourceVersion`,\n   `sourceTypeOverride` and `sourceLocationOverride` to CodeBuild.\n1. **env-vars-for-codebuild** (optional) :\n   A comma-separated list of the names of environment variables\n   that the action passes from GitHub Actions to CodeBuild.\n\n   The action passes these environment variables to CodeBuild\n   along with any environment variables that have a `github` prefix.\n\n   This list is often the same or a subset of the list of environment variables\n   that you define for GitHub actions in the `env` property.\n\n   Note: If you specify an environment variable\n   with the same name as one defined in your CodeBuild project,\n   the one defined here replaces the one in the CodeBuild project.\n   For a list of CodeBuild environment variables, see\n\n1. **update-interval** (optional) :\n   Update interval as seconds for how often the API is called to check on the status.\n\n   A higher value mitigates the chance of hitting API rate-limiting especially when\n   running many instances of this action in parallel, but also introduces a larger\n   potential time overhead (ranging from 0 to update interval) for the action to\n   fetch the build result and finish.\n\n   Lower value limits the potential time overhead worst case but it may hit the API\n   rate-limit more often, depending on the use-case.\n\n   The default value is 30.\n\n1. **update-back-off** (optional) :\n   Base back-off time in seconds for the update interval.\n\n   When API rate-limiting is hit the back-off time, augmented with jitter, will be\n   added to the next update interval.\n   E.g. with update interval of 30 and back-off time of 15, upon hitting the rate-limit\n   the next interval for the update call will be 30 + random*between(0, 15 * 2 \\*\\* 0))\n   seconds and if the rate-limit is hit again the next interval will be\n   30 + random*between(0, 15 * 2 \\*\\* 1) and so on.\n\n   The default value is 15.\n\n1. **hide-cloudwatch-logs** (optional) :\n   Set to `true` if you do not want CloudWatch Logs to be streamed to GitHub Action.\n\n### Outputs\n\n1. **aws-build-id** : The CodeBuild build ID of the build that the action ran.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis action is designed to give you the power of GitHub Actions\nwith options available in [AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] for more CPU and memory,\nand access to other resources.\n\nGitHub Actions provides a powerful system of event-based workflows,\nbut the hosted job runners cannot exceed the defined computing and memory limits,\nand might prevent you from accessing resources that you need for your project.\n\n[AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] is a fully managed continuous integration service\nthat can compile source code, run tests, and produce software packages that are ready to deploy.\nIt supports more environment options than standard GitHub Actions,\nincluding a selection of powerful computing environments with additional memory.\n\n### Resources and Architecture\n\n[GitHub Actions job runners][github actions job runners] have 2 x86_64 CPU cores and 7 GB RAM.\n\nThis is enough for the most common activities,\nbut some large or complex builds need more resources,\nand some builds need access to special CPU architectures or hardware.\n\n[CodeBuild compute types][codebuild compute types] offer options including:\n\n- up to 72 x86_64 vCPUs\n- up to 255 GB RAM\n- up to 8 ARM64 vCPUs\n- GPU hardware devices\n\n### Access\n\nYour workflow might require access to assets, configuration, or resources\nthat are impossible, difficult, or simply expensive\nto access from GitHub\'s hosted job runners\nbut are easy or cheap to access from CodeBuild.\n\n## Credentials and Permissions\n\nIn order for the action to run your CodeBuild project,\nyou need to provide AWS credentials.\nWe recommend using [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials]\nto configure your credentials for a job.\n\n**NOTE:\nGitHub Secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository.\nThis means that you cannot use this action directly in a workflow\nthat is triggered by pull requests from a fork.\nSee the [GitHub Secrets docs][github secrets access] for more information.**\n\nThe credentials that you provide need to have the following permissions:\n\n- `codebuild:StartBuild`\n- `codebuild:BatchGetBuilds`\n- `logs:GetLogEvents`\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [""codebuild:StartBuild"", ""codebuild:BatchGetBuilds""],\n      ""Resource"": [""arn:aws:codebuild:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:project/PROJECT_NAME""]\n    },\n    {\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [""logs:GetLogEvents""],\n      ""Resource"": [\n        ""arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:/aws/codebuild/PROJECT_NAME:*""\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples show how you can define a step in a workflow job.\nFor more information about GitHub Actions workflow syntax,\nsee the [GitHub docs][github workflow syntax].\n\nIf your CodeBuild project is already configured the way you want it,\nthe only CodeBuild Run input you need to provide is the project name.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Configure AWS Credentials\n  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n  with:\n    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n    aws-region: us-east-2\n- name: Run CodeBuild\n  uses: aws-actions/aws-codebuild-run-build@v1\n  with:\n    project-name: CodeBuildProjectName\n```\n\nIf you reuse a project in multiple jobs or repositories,\nyou might want to provide a bit more configuration.\nFor example, the following configuration\nspecifies an alternate location for the buildspec file.\nIt also tells AWS CodeBuild Run Build\nto send all of the environment variables defined in the `env:` list to CodeBuild.\nIf any of these environment variables are defined in the CodeBuild project,\nthis will overwrite them.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Configure AWS Credentials\n  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n  with:\n    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n    aws-region: us-east-2\n- name: Run CodeBuild\n  uses: aws-actions/aws-codebuild-run-build@v1\n  with:\n    project-name: CodeBuildProjectName\n    buildspec-override: path/to/buildspec.yaml or inline buildspec definition\n    compute-type-override: compute-type\n    environment-type-override: environment-type\n    image-override: ecr-image-uri\n    env-vars-for-codebuild: |\n      custom,\n      requester,\n      event-name\n  env:\n    custom: my environment variable\n    requester: ${{ github.actor }}\n    event-name: ${{ github.event_name }}\n```\n\n### Running Locally\n\nIt can be useful to run a build outside of CI.\nSo, this action can also be installed locally\nto kick off a CodeBuild project from your git sandbox.\nYou could push your changes to an open PR,\nbut if you only want to test one project this may be faster.\nIn order to use this tool,\nyou must first `git checkout` the commit that you want to test.\n\n```\nnpx @aws-actions/codebuild-run-build -p ProjectName -r remoteName\n```\n\nThis will use whatever commit you have checked out\nand push to a temporary branch in the specified remote.\nThen kick off the build\nand delete the remote branch when complete.\n\nYou can also install the project globally or locally\nand execute it that way.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### What we did\n\nWe call the [CodeBuild `StartBuild` API][codebuild startbuild],\nchecking out the commit that triggered the workflow.\n\nThe action waits for the build to complete while logging everything written to the build\'s\n[Amazon CloudWatch Logs][cloudwatch logs] [logstream][cloudwatch logs concepts].\nIf the `buildStatus` value in the StartBuild response is `SUCCEEDED`, the action succeeds.\nOtherwise, it fails.\n\nIn the call to StartBuild, we pass in all\n`GITHUB_` [environment variables][github environment variables] in the GitHub Actions environment,\nplus any environment variables that you specified in the `env-passthrough` input value.\n\nBy default, regardless of the project configuration in CodeBuild or GitHub Actions,\nwe always pass the following parameters and values to CodeBuild in the StartBuild API call.\n\n| CodeBuild value          | GitHub value                           |\n| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |\n| `sourceVersion`          | The commit that triggered the workflow |\n| `sourceTypeOverride`     | The string `\'GITHUB\'`                  |\n| `sourceLocationOverride` | The `HTTPS` git url for `context.repo` |\n\nIf you want to disable sending the parameters `sourceVersion`, `sourceTypeOverride` and `sourceLocationOverride` you can use `disable-source-override` input.\n\n### What we did not do\n\nThis action intentionally does not let you specify every option\nin the [CodeBuild::StartBuild][codebuild startbuild] API.\n\nBecause all GitHub Actions input values are passed through environment variables,\nthey must be simple strings.\nThis makes it difficult to pass complex structures as inputs.\n\nAlso, providing an input for every parameter in the `StartBuild` API\nwould have made it much more difficult to use and maintain this tool.\nWe would have to add many more inputs or require string values,\nwhile hoping that all supported configurations\nconformed to the environment variable length limits.\n\nFor this reason, and to simplify what we expect to be the most common use-cases,\nwe chose to start with the simplest possible configuration.\nIf you find that these options don\'t meet your needs, please open an issue to let us know.\n\n## Release Process\n\nBy creating a new Release a workflow is triggered creating a new commit which only contains `dist` and the `action.yml`. The necessary tags, i.e. for the release v1.0.7, the tag v1.0.7 is created and the v1.0 and v1 tags are updated.\n\nFor the tagging and building the [build-and-tag](https://github.com/JasonEtco/build-and-tag-action) action by [Jason Etcovitch](https://github.com/JasonEtco) is used. It expects to have the main attribute and a build script to be set in the `package.json`. It then builds the code with the ncc compiler and creates the new tag/ updates existing tags for minor and major versions automatically.\n\n## License\n\nThis SDK is distributed under the\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),\nsee LICENSE and NOTICE for more information.\n\n[codebuild]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html\n[codebuild project]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/working-with-build-projects.html\n[codebuild startbuild]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_StartBuild.html\n[codebuild compute types]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html\n[codebuild buildspec]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html\n[cloudwatch logs]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html\n[cloudwatch logs concepts]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogsConcepts.html\n[github environment variables]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables\n[github actions job runners]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources\n[github workflow syntax]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions\n[github secrets access]: https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow\n[aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials]: https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If unit/system tests are defined run them. `ROS Prerelease Test <http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest>`__ can optionally be run.\n* Proven to cover the general requirements of the ROS-based robotics repositories. Easily configurable.\n* Users can add custom pre/post processes.\n* Covers ROS1 Indigo, Jade, Kinetic, Lunar, Melodic, Noetic and ROS2 distributions.\n* This repo provides scripts for `Bitbucket CI`, `Gitlab CI`, `GitHub Actions` and `Travis CI` only, but it can be easily adapted for other CI services.\n\nFor a brief overall introduction, you could also check a presentation:\n\n* `ROS-Industrial community meeting <http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/6/14/ros-i-community-web-meeting-june-2016>`__\n\nQuick Start\n============\n\nWith a few steps, you can start in your client repository using CI confiurations stored in `industrial_ci`.\n\nFor Travis CI\n--------------\n\n1. Activate CI for your github repository on `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.com/>`__).\n\n   a) You may do so either at https://travis-ci.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION or at https://travis-ci.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_USER (depending on where your repository sits).\n   b) Activate CI beta for your bitbucket repository is similar, but the target link that your status badge directs to needs to be modified from https://travis-ci.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME to https://travis-ci.com/bitbucket/USERNAME/REPO_NAME. By default, the generated link directs to a github repository.\n\n2. Add `.travis.yml` file to your repository root (`complete template <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/blob/master/doc/.travis.yml>`__):\n\n::\n\n  language: generic\n  services:\n    - docker\n\n  env:\n    matrix:\n      - ROS_DISTRO=""indigo""\n\n  install:\n    - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci.git .industrial_ci -b master\n  script:\n    - .industrial_ci/travis.sh\n\n* Note: The name `.industrial_ci` is NO longer REQUIRED for the cloned folder starting version 0.3.2; you can pick any name (recommended practice to keep the folder hidden (by prepending ""."").\n\nFor Gitlab CI\n-------------\n\n1. Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to `official doc <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/>`__ for the steps to do so. Note for Gitlab CI, necessary steps might be different between hosted version (i.e. the one on gitlab.com) v.s. the one on your own server, which Gitlab doesn\'t always clarify in its documentation.\n\n   1. For your server version, enable a runner for your Gitlab project which uses the Docker executor. See instructions on how to `install <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html>`__ and `register <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html>`__ such a runner with your Gitlab instance if you haven\'t done so yet.\n\n2. In `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:\n\n::\n\n   image: docker:git\n   services:\n     - docker:dind\n   before_script:\n     - apk add --update bash coreutils tar\n     - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master\n   indigo:\n     script: .industrial_ci/gitlab.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo\n\n\nFor Bitbucket Pipelines\n-----------------------\n\n1. Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to `official doc <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines-792298921.html>`__ for the steps to do so.\n2. In the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:\n\n::\n\n   image: docker:git\n\n   pipelines:\n     default:\n        - step:\n            services:\n              - docker\n            script:\n              - apk add --update bash coreutils tar\n              - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master\n              - .industrial_ci/bitbucket.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo\n\n   definitions:\n     services:\n       docker:\n         memory: 2048\n\n\nFor GitHub Actions\n-----------------------\n\n1. Create `.github/workflows/industrial_ci_action.yml` (industrial_ci_action.yml is arbitrary, `complete template <doc/industrial_ci_action.yml>`__)  with the following configuration, (this snippet can be the entire content of the file), replacing melodic for your chosen distro:\n\n::\n\n   name: CI\n\n   on: [push, pull_request]\n\n   jobs:\n     industrial_ci:\n       strategy:\n         matrix:\n           env:\n             - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: testing}\n             - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: main}\n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n       steps:\n         - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n         - uses: \'ros-industrial/industrial_ci@master\'\n           env: ${{matrix.env}}\n\nFor Google Cloud Build\n----------------------\n1. Connect your source code repository to your Google Cloud Project. Please refer to the `official documentation <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers#gcloud>`__ for the steps to do so.\n2. In the `cloudbuild.yaml` file in your client repo, add the following minimal configuration\n\n::\n\n  steps:\n    - name: \'ros:melodic\'\n      entrypoint: \'bash\'\n      args:\n        - \'-c\'\n        - |-\n          git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master\n          .industrial_ci/ci.sh\n      env:\n        - \'ISOLATION=shell\'\n        - \'CI=true\'\n\nConcrete examples of config files\n-------------------------------------\n\n- A `template for Travis CI <doc/.travis.yml>`__.\n- For development branch intended for ROS Indigo: `ros_canopen <https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros_canopen/blob/0a42bf181804167834b8dc3b80bfca971f24546f/.travis.yml>`__\n- For development branch intended for ROS Indigo onward:\n   - `example 1 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/blob/eeb6a470e05233d0efaaf8c32a9e4133cdcbb80b/.travis.yml>`__ (Indigo and Jade compatible).\n   - `example 2 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/leap_motion/blob/954924befd2a6755f9d310f4a8b57aa526056a80/.travis.yml>`__ (Indigo, Jade, Kinetic compatible.

You can see how options are used.\n- For Gitlab CI, a small `sample config <./.gitlab-ci.yml>`__.\n\nMetrics\n========\n\nThere might not an easy way to precisely count how many repositories out there are using `industrial_ci`. Counting that number isn\'t even our priority at all, but we\'re often simply curious. Here\'s some ways that give us some clues for the usage metrics:\n\n- `Searching Github repos that contain string industrial_ci <https://github.com/search?p=1&q=industrial_ci+-repo%3Aros-industrial%2Findustrial_ci&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93>`__) (with some duplicates.

336,"b'# GitHub Action - Android Emulator Runner\n\n<p align=""left"">\n  <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg""></a>\n</p>\n\nA GitHub Action for installing, configuring and running hardware-accelerated Android Emulators on macOS virtual machines.\n\nThe old ARM-based emulators were slow and are no longer supported by Google. The modern Intel Atom (x86 and x86_64) emulators can be fast, but rely on two forms of hardware acceleration to reach their peak potential: [Graphics Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-graphics), e.g. `emulator -gpu host` and [Virtual Machine(VM) Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-vm), e.g. `emulator -accel on`. **Note:** GPU and VM Acceleration are two different and non-mutually exclusive forms of Hardware Acceleration.\n\nThis presents a challenge when running emulators on CI especially when running emulators within a docker container, because **Nested Virtualization** must be supported by the host VM which isn\'t the case for most cloud-based CI providers due to infrastructural limits.  If you want to learn more about Emulators on CI, here\'s an article [Yang](https://github.com/ychescale9) wrote: [Running Android Instrumented Tests on CI](https://dev.to/ychescale9/running-android-emulators-on-ci-from-bitrise-io-to-github-actions-3j76).\n\n## A note on VM Acceleration and why we don\'t need HAXM anymore\n\nAccording to [this documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#vm-mac), ""on Mac OS X v10.10 Yosemite and higher, the Android Emulator uses the built-in [Hypervisor.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) by default, and falls back to using Intel HAXM if Hypervisor.Framework fails to initialize."" This means that **HAXM is only needed to achieve VM Acceleration if this default Hypervisor is not available on macOS machines.**\n\n**Note**: Manually enabling and downloading HAXM is not recommended because it is redundant and not needed (see above), and for users of macOS 10.13 High Sierra and higher: macOS 10.13 [disables installation of kernel extensions by default](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017658). Because Intel HAXM is a kernel extension, we would need to manually enable its installation on the base runner VM. Furthermore, manually trying to install HAXM on a Github Runner [brings up a popup](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/discussions/286#discussioncomment-4026120) which further hinders tests from running.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis action helps automate and configure the process of setting up an emulator and running your tests by doing the following:\n\n- Install / update the required **Android SDK** components including `build-tools`, `platform-tools`, `platform` (for the required API level), `emulator` and `system-images` (for the required API level).\n- Create a new instance of **AVD** with the provided [configurations](#configurations).\n- Launch a new Emulator with the provided [configurations](#configurations).\n- Wait until the Emulator is booted and ready for use.\n- Run a custom script provided by user once the Emulator is up and running - e.g. `./gradlew connectedCheck`.\n- Kill the Emulator and finish the action.\n\n## Usage & Examples\n\nA workflow that uses **android-emulator-runner** to run your instrumented tests on **API 29**:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: 29\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nWe can also leverage GitHub Actions\'s build matrix to test across multiple configurations:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        api-level: [21, 23, 29]\n        target: [default, google_apis]\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          target: ${{ matrix.target }}\n          arch: x86_64\n          profile: Nexus 6\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nIf you need specific versions of **NDK** and **CMake** installed:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: 29\n          ndk: 21.0.6113669\n          cmake: 3.10.2.4988404\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nWe can significantly reduce emulator startup time by setting up AVD snapshot caching:\n\n1. add a `gradle/gradle-build-action@v2` step for caching Gradle, more details see [#229](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/229)\n2. add an `actions/cache@v3` step for caching the `avd`\n3. add a `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to generate a clean snapshot - specify `emulator-options` without `no-snapshot`\n4. add another `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to run your tests using existing AVD / snapshot - specify `emulator-options` with `no-snapshot-save`\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        api-level: [21, 23, 29]\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Gradle cache\n        uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n        \n      - name: AVD cache\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        id: avd-cache\n        with:\n          path: |\n            ~/.android/avd/*\n            ~/.android/adb*\n          key: avd-${{ matrix.api-level }}\n\n      - name: create AVD and generate snapshot for caching\n        if: steps.avd-cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          force-avd-creation: false\n          emulator-options: -no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -noaudio -no-boot-anim -camera-back none\n          disable-animations: false\n          script: echo ""Generated AVD snapshot for caching.""\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          force-avd-creation: false\n          emulator-options: -no-snapshot-save -no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -noaudio -no-boot-anim -camera-back none\n          disable-animations: true\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\n## Configurations\n\n| **Input** | **Required** | **Default** | **Description** |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| `api-level` | Required | N/A | API level of the platform system image - e.g. 23 for Android Marshmallow, 29 for Android 10. **Minimum API level supported is 15**. |\n| `target` | Optional | `default` | Target of the system image - `default`, `google_apis`, `playstore`, `android-wear`, `android-wear-cn`, `android-tv`, `google-tv`, `aosp_atd` or `google_atd`.

You can get it running much faster on self-hosted Linux runners but only if the underlying instances support KVM (which most don\'t). Things might be better on the newer Larger runners but they are still in Beta. It is possible to use this Action with hardware accelerated Linux VMs hosted by a third-party runner provider.\n\nFor a longer answer please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/46).\n\n## Who is using Android Emulator Runner?\n\nThese are some of the open-source projects using (or used) **Android Emulator Runner**:\n\n- [coil-kt/coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [cashapp/sqldelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [square/workflow-kotlin](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [square/retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [natario1/CameraView](https://github.com/natario1/CameraView/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [natario1/Transcoder](https://github.com/natario1/Transcoder/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [chrisbanes/insetter](https://github.com/chrisbanes/insetter/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [slackhq/keeper](https://github.com/slackhq/keeper/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [android/compose-samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [ReactiveCircus/streamlined](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/streamlined/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [ReactiveCircus/FlowBinding](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/FlowBinding/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [JakeWharton/RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example](https://github.com/vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [ashishb/adb-enhanced](https://github.com/ashishb/adb-enhanced/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [vgaidarji/ci-matters](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yaml)\n- [simpledotorg/simple-android](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-android/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [cashapp/copper](https://github.com/cashapp/copper/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/build.yaml)\n- [square/radiography](https://github.com/square/radiography/blob/main/.github/workflows/android.yml)\n- [Shopify/android-testify](https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/blob/master/.github/workflows/sample_build.yml)\n- [square/leakcanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [hash-checker/hash-checker](https://github.com/hash-checker/hash-checker/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [hash-checker/hash-checker-lite](https://github.com/hash-checker/hash-checker-lite/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [Kiwix/kiwix-android](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/develop/.github/workflows)\n- [wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia](https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia/blob/main/.github/workflows)\n- [google/android-fhir](https://github.com/google/android-fhir/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [google/accompanist](https://github.com/google/accompanist/blob/main/.github/workflows)\n- [dotanuki-labs/norris](https://github.com/dotanuki-labs/norris/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)\n- [tinylog-org/tinylog](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/blob/v3.0/.github/workflows/build.yaml)\n- [hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project/blob/development/.github/workflows/sormas_app_ci.yml)\n- [ACRA/acra](https://github.com/ACRA/acra/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)\n- [bitfireAT/davx5-ose](https://github.com/bitfireAT/davx5-ose/blob/dev-ose/.github/workflows/test-dev.yml)\n\nIf you are using **Android Emulator Runner** and want your project included in the list, please feel free to open a pull request.\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

344,"b'# install-jdk\n\nAn action to download and install JDKs for use in workflows.\n\nThis action is based on the [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)\naction by GitHub which works perfectly fine for simple workflows but does not\nscale and lacks configurability.\n\nJDKs are downloaded from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n#### Basic\n\n```\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v1\n- uses: AdoptOpenJDK/install-jdk@v1\n  with:\n    version: \'13\'\n    architecture: x64\n```\n\n#### Multiple JDKs\n\nSome projects may require multiple JDK versions to build. `install-jdk` supports\ninstalling JDKs to one (or more) given `target` environment variables.\n\n```\n- uses: AdoptOpenJDK/install-jdk@v1\n  with:\n    version: \'8\'\n    architecture: x64\n- uses: AdoptOpenJDK/install-jdk@v1\n  with:\n    version: \'13\'\n    architecture: x64\n    targets: \'JDK_13\'\n```\n\n\n### Configuration:\n\n| Parameter            | Default                        |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| `version`            |                                |\n| `architecture`       | `x64`                          |\n| `source`             | `releases`                     |\n| `sourceType`         |                                |\n| `archiveBasePath`    | `/Contents/Home/` (macOS only) |\n| `useArchiveBasePath` | `true`                         |\n| `archiveExtension`   |                                |\n| `targets`            | `JAVA_HOME`                    |\n| `impl   `            | `hotspot`                      |\n\n#### `version`\n\nThe Java version to install a JDK for. (Supported values are: `1.8`, `8`, `9`,\n`10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, ...)\n\nBy default, this action will try to install the latest JDK release for the\nspecified version from AdoptOpenJDK. Alternatively, a `source` can be specified\nexplicitly.\n\nThe `version` key should be set accordingly for custom downloads since it is\nused to cache JDKs which are used multiple times during the workflow.\n\n#### `architecture`\n\nThe target architecture of the JDK to install.\n\nDefaults to `x64`.\n\n#### `source`\n\nA custom source for a JDK. (See `sourceType` for supported values.)\n\n#### `sourceType`\n\nThe type of the `source` parameter. Supported source types are:\n\n- `url` - HTTP and HTTPS URL sources\n- `file` - local directories, or compressed archives\n- `buildType` - AdoptOpenJDK build types (""nightly"", or ""releases"".)\n\nThe parameter may be set to empty, to automatically infer the type. The inferred\ntype is:\n\n1. `url`, if `source` starts with ""http://"" or ""https://"",\n2. `file`, if `source` resembles a valid local file path and the file exists, \n3. or `buildType` otherwise.\n\n#### `archiveBasePath`\n\ninstall-jdk expects a single top-level folder in archive packages. This\nparameter may be used to specify the subdirectory of said folder in which the\nJDK resides. This must be empty, or a `/`-separated path.\n\nBy default, this parameter is set to `/Contents/Home/` on macOS only to support\nOpenJDK builds from Oracle, and OpenJDK and OpenJ9 builds from AdoptOpenJDK\nout of the box.\n\nWhen using builds from other sources, it may be necessary to disable use of this\nparameter since the action cannot differentiate between empty and unspecified\nparameters. (See `useArchiveBasePath`.)\n\n#### `useArchiveBasePath`\n\nDisables use of the `archiveBasePath` parameter. This must be a boolean value.\n\nBuild archives from custom other may have different directory structures for\nwhich the default configuration would fail.\nE.g.: For Azul\'s Zulu builds it should be set to false (`useArchiveBasePath : \'false\'`).\n\n#### `archiveExtension`\n\nThe extension of the JDK archive. (Supported values are: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.7z`)\n\nSpecifying this parameter is required when a custom `source` is set.\n\n#### `targets`\n\nA semicolon-separated list of environment variables which will be set up to\npoint to the installation directory of the JDK.\n\nBy default, this is set to `JAVA_HOME`. Keep in mind that this is overwritten\nwhen specifying targets explicitly. Thus, if you want to make a JDK available\nfrom - say - `JDK_X` and `JAVA_HOME`, you would need to specify:\n\n    targets: \'JDK_X;JAVA_HOME\'\n\n#### `impl`\n\nJVM implementation.

Check it out here: https://github.com/php-actions/example-phpunit.\n\nInputs\n------\n\nThe following configuration options are available:\n\n+ `version` The version of PHPUnit to use e.g. `9` or `9.5.0` (default: latest)\n+ `php_version` The version of PHP to use e.g. `7.4` (default: latest)\n+ `php_extensions` Space-separated list of extensions using [php-build][php-build] e.g. `xdebug mbstring` (default: N/A)\n+ `vendored_phpunit_path` The path to a phar file already present on the runner (default: N/A)\n+ `configuration` Path to the `phpunit.xml` file (default: `test/phpunit/phpunit.xml`)\n+ `log_junit` Log test execution in JUnit XML format to file\n+ `log_teamcity` Log test execution in TeamCity format to file \n+ `testdox_html` Write documentation in HTML format to file\n+ `testdox_text` Write documentation in Text format to file\n+ `memory_limit` The memory limit to run your tests with (default: `128M`)\n+ `bootstrap` The path to the bootstrap file\n+ `filter` Filter which tests to run\n+ `testsuite` Specify a testsuite to run\n+ `group` Only runs tests from the specified group(s)\n+ `exclude_group` Exclude tests from the specified group(s)\n+ `test_suffix` Only search for test in files with specified suffix(es)\n+ `whitelist` Path to directory to whitelist for code coverage analysis\n+ `coverage_clover` Generate code coverage report in Clover XML format\n+ `coverage_cobertura` Generate code coverage report in Cobertura XML format\n  required\n+ `coverage_crap4j` Generate code coverage report in Crap4J XML format\n+ `coverage_html` Generate code coverage report in HTML format\n+ `coverage_php` Export PHP_CodeCoverage object to file\n+ `coverage_text` Generate code coverage report in text format (true to output to console, path to output to file)\n+ `coverage_xml` Generate code coverage report in PHPUnit XML format\n+ `args` Extra arguments to pass to the phpunit binary\n\nThe syntax for passing in a custom input is the following:\n\n```yaml\n...\n\njobs:\n  unit-tests:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: PHPUnit tests\n      uses: php-actions/phpunit@v3\n      with:\n        configuration: ""custom/path/to/phpunit.xml""\n        memory_limit: ""256M""\n```\n\nIf you require other configurations of phpunit, please request them in the [Github issue tracker][issues]\n\nPHP and PHPUnit versions\n------------------------\n\nIt\'s possible to run any version of PHPUnit under any version of PHP, with any PHP extensions you require. This is configured with the following inputs:\n\n+ `version` - the version number of PHPUnit to run e.g. `9` or `9.5.0` (default: latest)\n+ `php_version` - the version number of PHP to use e.g. `7.4` (default: latest)\n+ `php_extensions` - a space-separated list of extensions to install using [php-build][php-build] e.g. `xdebug mbstring` (default: N/A)\n\nPlease note the version number specified within your Action configuration must match your `composer.json` major version number. For example, if your composer.json requires `phpunit/phpunit 8.5.8`, you must use the `version: 8.5.8` input, as major versions of PHPUnit are incompatible with each other.\n\nIf you require a specific version that is not compatible with Github Actions for some reason, please make a request in the [Github issue tracker][issues].\n\nCoverage\n--------\n\nTo store the code coverage, use the `coverage_*` input that is appropriate for your needs. Coverage information is made possible by using the xdebug extension, which will be required to be added to the `php_extensions` input to work.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  unit-tests:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: PHPUnit tests\n      uses: php-actions/phpunit@v3\n      with:\n        php_extensions: ""xdebug""\n        coverage_clover: ""coverage/clover.xml""\n```\n\nThe above example will output coverage information to the terminal. Pass a file path to output to a file.\n\nIf you want to report coverage information somewhere, please see the [code-coverage] action.\n\nGithub Actions releases\n-----------------------\n\nPreviously, the Github Actions release version numbers were in sync with the PHPUnit version, but this imposed too many limitations.

With an integrated multi-scanner based design, Scan can detect various kinds of security flaws in your application and infrastructure code in a single fast scan without the need for any _remote server_! The product supports a range of integration options: from scanning every push via a git hook to scanning every build and pull-request in the CI/CD pipelines.\n\n## Highlighted Features\n\n### Supported scans\n\n- Credentials Scanning to detect accidental secret leaks\n- Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) for a range of languages and frameworks\n- Open-source dependencies and License audit\n- Pull Request status checks and Scan summary as comments\n\n### Languages supported\n\n- Salesforce Apex\n- bash\n- Go\n- Java\n- JSP\n- Node.js\n- Oracle PL/SQL\n- Python\n- Rust (Dependency and Licence scan alone)\n- Terraform\n- Salesforce Visual Force\n- Apache Velocity\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSimply add the following snippet to your GitHub actions workflow.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Perform Scan\n  uses: ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action@master\n```\n\nTo override the built-in language detection, use the `type` parameter.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Perform Scan\n  uses: ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action@master\n  with:\n    type: ""credscan,java,depscan""\n```\n\nFor a full example, refer to the [workflow](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/blob/master/.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml) file used by Scan to scan itself.\n\n### Viewing Reports\n\nScan summary would get printed directly on the action build log as shown.\n\n![Scan Invocation](docs/scan-invocation.png)\n\n![Scan Summary](docs/scan-summary.png)\n\nThe action also produces HTML reports for the various scans. To upload the reports as build artifacts to your pipeline use the `upload-artifact` step as shown:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Perform Scan\n  uses: ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action@master\n  with:\n    type: ""credscan,python""\n  env:\n    WORKSPACE: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/${{ github.sha }}\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1\n  with:\n    name: reports\n    path: reports\n```\n\nIn the above configuration, two environment variables are used to customise the behaviour:\n\n- WORKSPACE: Specifying the URL to your repository would transform the filenames in the reports to hyperlinks. Specify empty string `""""` when using the `Code Scanning` feature on GitHub\n- GITHUB_TOKEN: Passing the GitHub token would improve the scan results by increasing the allowance for package names lookup during dependency scanning\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\n### Automatic build\n\nScan can attempt to build certain project types automatically. Java, node.js, rust, go and csharp are currently supported. To enable auto-build, set the environment variable `SCAN_AUTO_BUILD` as shown:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Perform Scan\n  uses: ShiftLeftSecurity/scan-action@master\n  with:\n    type: ""credscan,python""\n  env:\n    WORKSPACE: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/${{ github.sha }}\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    SCAN_AUTO_BUILD: true\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to the [documentation](https://slscan.io) on using ShiftLeft Scan in your pipelines.\n\n## Support\n\nDevelopers behind scan are available on a dedicated [discord channel](https://discord.gg/7WvSxdK) for questions and support. For defects, raising an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/issues) is best.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    label: \'feature\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />\n\nAdding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using [PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).\n\n## Exclude Pull Requests\n\nWith the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nexclude-labels:\n  - \'skip-changelog\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.\n\n## Replacers\n\nYou can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.\n\n```yml\nreplacers:\n  - search: \'/CVE-(\\d{4})-(\\d+)/g\'\n    replace: \'https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-$1-$2\'\n  - search: \'myname\'\n    replace: \'My Name\'\n```\n\n## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning\n\nIf your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.\n\nFor example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.\n\n## GitHub Installation Permissions\n\nRelease Drafter requires full write, because GitHub does not offer a limited scope for only writing releases. **Don\'t install Release Drafter to your entire GitHub account \xe2\x80\x94 only add the repositories you want to draft releases on.**\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nyarn\n\n# Run the tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run the app locally\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):\n\n```sh\n# Run the tests\ndocker-compose run --rm app npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThird-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nIf you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.\n\n## Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).\n\n## Releasing\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]\n```\n\nThe command does the following:\n\n- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes\n- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch\n- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:\n  - Pushes the tag to GitHub\n  - Publishes the npm release\n  - Deploys to [Now](https://now.sh)\n  - Opens the GitHub releases page so you can publish the release notes\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Includes npm, pnpm and Yarn installation, custom caching and lots of configuration options.\n\n Placing `use: cypress-io/github-action@v5` into a GitHub Action workflow gives you a simple way to run Cypress. The action takes the project\'s npm, pnpm or Yarn package manager lock file, installs dependencies and caches these dependencies for future use. It then proceeds to run Cypress end-to-end tests with the built-in Electron browser and provides a test summary after completion.\n\n If you are testing against a running server like the [Cypress Kitchen Sink showcase example](https://example.cypress.io/) on https://example.cypress.io/ no other parameters are necessary. In other cases where you need to fire up a development server, you can add the [start](#start-server) parameter to the workflow.

These may need modification to be applied to Cypress 10 and later. Each of these external links is listed with a `(legacy)` notation.\n\n**Note:** this package assumes that [cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) is declared as a development dependency in the [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file) file. The [cypress npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) is required to run Cypress via its [Module API](https://on.cypress.io/module-api).\n\n### End-to-End Testing\n\n```yml\nname: End-to-end tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      # Install npm dependencies, cache them correctly\n      # and run all Cypress tests\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n```\n\n[![End-to-End example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-basic/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml)\n\nThe workflow file [example-basic.yml](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml) shows how Cypress runs on GH Actions using Ubuntu (20 and 22), Windows, and macOS without additional OS dependencies necessary.\n\nThis workflow uses the default [test type](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Test-types) of [End-to-End (E2E) Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end). Alternatively, [Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Component) can be utilized by referencing the [Component Testing](#component-testing) section below.\n\n### Component Testing\n\nTo use [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component-testing) add `component: true`\n\n```yml\nname: End-to-end tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          component: true\n```\n\n[![Component Testing example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-component-test/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml)\n\nSee the example project [component-tests](examples/component-tests/) and the [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) workflow for more details.\n\n### Action version\n\n**Best practice:**\n\nOur examples specify using branch [v5](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tree/v5) which is the action\'s latest major version:\n\n```yml\n- name: Cypress run\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n```\n\nWhen using `cypress-io/github-action@v5` from your workflow file, you will automatically use the latest [tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tags) from branch [v5](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tree/v5).\n\nAlternatively, to mitigate unforeseen breaks, bind to a specific [tag](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/tags), for example:\n\n```yml\n- name: Cypress run\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5.1.0\n```\n\nThe changes associated with each tag are shown under GitHub\'s [releases](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/releases) list. Refer also to the [Changelog](#changelog) for an overview of major changes.\n\n### Browser\n\nSpecify the browser name or path with the `browser` parameter. The default browser, if none is specified, is the built-in [Electron browser](https://on.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser).\n\n### Chrome\n\n```yml\nname: Chrome\non: push\njobs:\n  chrome:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    name: E2E on Chrome\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          browser: chrome\n```\n\n[![Chrome example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-chrome/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-chrome.yml)\n\n### Firefox\n\n```yml\nname: Firefox\non: push\njobs:\n  firefox:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    name: E2E on Firefox\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          browser: firefox\n```\n\n[![Firefox example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-firefox/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-firefox.yml)\n\n### Edge\n\n```yml\nname: Edge\non: push\njobs:\n  edge:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    name: E2E on Edge\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          browser: edge\n```\n\n[![Edge example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-edge/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-edge.yml)\n\n### Headed\n\nRun the browser in headed mode - as of Cypress v8.0 the `cypress run` command executes tests in `headless` mode by default\n\n```yml\nname: Chrome headed\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          browser: chrome\n          headed: true\n```\n\n### Docker image\n\nYou can run tests in a GH Action in your Docker container.\n\n```yml\nname: E2E in custom container\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    # Cypress Docker image with Chrome v106\n    # and Firefox v106 pre-installed\n    container: cypress/browsers:node18.12.0-chrome106-ff106\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          browser: chrome\n```\n\n### Env\n\nSpecify the env argument with `env` parameter\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run with env\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          env: host=api.dev.local,port=4222\n```\n\nWhen passing the environment variables this way, unfortunately due to GitHub Actions syntax, the variables should be listed in a single line, which can be hard to read. As an alternative, you can use the step\'s `env` block where every variable can be set on its own line. In this case, you should prefix every variable with `CYPRESS_` because such variables [are loaded by Cypress automatically](https://on.cypress.io/environment-variables). The above code example is equivalent to:\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run with env\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        env:\n          CYPRESS_host: api.dev.local\n          CYPRESS_port: 4222\n```\n\nFor more examples, see the workflows below, using environment variables for [recording](#record-test-results-on-cypress-cloud).\n\n[![Env example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-env/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-env.yml)\n\n### Specs\n\nSpecify the [spec files to run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt) with `spec` parameter\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          spec: cypress/e2e/spec1.cy.js\n```\n\nYou can pass multiple specs and wild card patterns using multi-line parameter, see [example-config.yml](.github/workflows/example-config.yml):\n\n```yml\nspec: |\n  cypress/e2e/spec-a.cy.js\n  cypress/**/*-b.cy.js\n```\n\nFor more information, visit [the Cypress command-line docs](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt).\n\n### Project\n\nSpecify the [project to run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt) with `project` parameter\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          project: ./some/nested/folder\n```\n\nFor more information, visit [the Cypress command-line docs](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt).\n\n### Record test results on Cypress Cloud\n\nBy setting the parameter `record` to `true`, you can record your test results into the [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). Read the [Cypress Cloud documentation](https://on.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) to learn how to sign up and create a Cypress Cloud project.\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n        env:\n          # pass the Cypress Cloud record key as an environment variable\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          # pass GitHub token to allow accurately detecting a build vs a re-run build\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n[![recording example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-recording/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-recording.yml)\n\n**Tip 1:** We recommend using the action with `on: push` instead of `on: pull_request` to get the most accurate information related to the commit on Cypress Cloud. With pull requests, the merge commit is created automatically and might not correspond to a meaningful commit in the repository.\n\n**Tip 2:** we recommend passing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret (created by the GH Action automatically) as an environment variable. This will allow correctly identifying every build and avoid confusion when re-running a build.\n\n**Tip 3:** if running on `pull_request` event, the commit message is ""merge SHA into SHA"", which is not what you want probably. You can overwrite the commit message sent to Cypress Cloud by setting an environment variable. See [issue 124](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/124#issuecomment-653180260) for details.\n\n**Tip 4:** to record the project needs `projectId`. Typically this value is saved in the [Cypress Configuration File](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Configuration-File). If you want to avoid this, pass the `projectId` using an environment variable:\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n        env:\n          # pass the Cypress Cloud record key as an environment variable\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          # pass GitHub token to allow accurately detecting a build vs a re-run build\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          # pass the project ID from the secrets through environment variable\n          CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}\n```\n\n### Tag recordings\n\nYou can pass a single or multiple tags when recording a run. For example\n\n```yml\nname: tags\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    # let\'s make sure our ""app"" works on several versions of Node\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node: [16, 18, 20]\n    name: E2E on Node v${{ matrix.node }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}\n      - run: node -v\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          tag: node-${{ matrix.node }}\n        env:\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThe recording will have tags as labels on the run.\n\n![Tags](images/tags.png)\n\nYou can pass multiple tags using commas like `tag: node-18,nightly,staging`.\n\n### Specify auto cancel after failures\n\nSpecify the number of failed tests that will cancel a run when using the [Cypress Cloud Auto Cancellation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) feature.\n\nThis feature requires Cypress 12.6.0 or later and a [Cypress Cloud Business or Enterprise](https://www.cypress.io/cloud/) account.\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress E2E Tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    name: E2E\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          # Cancel the run after 2 failed tests\n          auto-cancel-after-failures: 2\n        env:\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nSee [Auto Cancellation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation) for more information.\n\n### Artifacts\n\nIf you don\'t record the test run on Cypress Cloud, you can still store generated videos and screenshots as CI artifacts. See the workflow example below.\n\n```yml\nname: Artifacts\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    name: Artifacts\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n      # after the test run completes store videos and any screenshots\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        # add the line below to store screenshots only on failures\n        # if: failure()\n        with:\n          name: cypress-screenshots\n          path: cypress/screenshots\n          if-no-files-found: ignore # \'warn\' or \'error\' are also available, defaults to `warn`\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          name: cypress-videos\n          path: cypress/videos\n          if-no-files-found: ignore # \'warn\' or \'error\' are also available, defaults to `warn`\n```\n\n### Quiet flag\n\nYou can provide `quiet` flag for cypress run to silence any Cypress specific output from stdout\n\n```yml\nname: example-quiet\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      # Install npm dependencies, cache them correctly\n      # and run all Cypress tests with `quiet` parameter\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: ./\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/quiet\n          quiet: true\n```\n\n[![example-quiet](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-quiet/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-quiet.yml)\n\n### Config\n\nSpecify [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html) values with `config` parameter\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          config: pageLoadTimeout=100000,baseUrl=http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n[![example-config](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-config/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-config.yml)\n\n### Config File\n\nSpecify the path to your config file with `config-file` parameter\n\n```yml\nname: Cypress tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          config-file: tests/cypress-config.json\n```\n\n### Parallel\n\n**Note:** Cypress parallelization requires a [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction) account.\n\nYou can spin multiple containers running in parallel using `strategy: matrix` argument. Just add more dummy items to the `containers: [1, 2, ...]` array to spin more free or paid containers. Then use `record` and `parallel` parameters to [load balance tests](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization).\n\n```yml\nname: Parallel Cypress Tests\non: push\njobs:\n  test:\n    name: Cypress run\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    strategy:\n      # when one test fails, DO NOT cancel the other\n      # containers, because this will kill Cypress processes\n      # leaving Cypress Cloud hanging ...\n      # https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/issues/48\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        # run 3 copies of the current job in parallel\n        containers: [1, 2, 3]\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      # because of ""record"" and ""parallel"" parameters\n      # these containers will load balance all found tests among themselves\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          parallel: true\n          group: \'Actions example\'\n        env:\n          # pass the Cypress Cloud record key as an environment variable\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          # Recommended: pass the GitHub token lets this action correctly\n          # determine the unique run id necessary to re-run the checks\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n![Parallel run](images/parallel.png)\n\n**Warning \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f:** Cypress actions use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to get the correct branch and the number of jobs run, making it possible to re-run without the need of pushing an empty commit. If you don\'t want to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` you can still run your tests without problem with the only note that Cypress Cloud\'s API connects parallel jobs into a single logical run using GitHub commit SHA plus workflow name. If you attempt to re-run GitHub checks, Cypress Cloud thinks the run has already ended. In order to truly rerun parallel jobs, push an empty commit with `git commit --allow-empty -m ""re-run checks"" && git push`. As another work around you can generate and cache a custom build id, read [Adding a unique build number to GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/attest-engineering/adding-a-unique-github-build-identifier-7aa2e83cadca).\n\nThe Cypress GH Action does not spawn or create any additional containers - it only links the multiple containers spawned using the matrix strategy into a single logical Cypress Cloud run where it splits the specs amongst the machines. See the [Cypress parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) guide for the explanation.\n\nDuring staged rollout of a new GitHub-hosted runner version, GitHub may provide a mixture of current and new image versions used by the container matrix. It is recommended to use a [Docker image](#docker-image) in the parallel job run which avoids any Cypress Cloud errors due to browser major version mismatch from the two different image versions. A [Docker image](#docker-image) is not necessary if testing against the default built-in Electron browser because this browser version is fixed by the Cypress version in use and it is unaffected by any GitHub runner image rollout.\n\n### Component and E2E Testing\n\n[Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#Component) and [End-to-End (E2E) Testing](https://on.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end) types can be combined in the same job using separate steps\n\n```yml\n- name: Run E2E tests\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n\n- name: Run Component Testing\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    # we have already installed everything\n    install: false\n    component: true\n```\n\nSee the example project [component-test](examples/component-tests/) and the [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) workflow for more details.\n\n### Build app\n\nYou can run a build step before starting tests\n\n```yml\nname: Build\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          build: npm run build\n```\n\n### Start server\n\nIf your tests run against a local server, use the `start` parameter to start your server. The server will run in the background.\n\n```yml\nname: With server\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          start: npm start\n```\n**Caution:** use the `start` parameter only to start a server, not to run Cypress, otherwise tests may be run twice. The action runs Cypress tests by default, unless the parameter `runTests` is set to `false`.\n\n**Note:** sometimes on Windows you need to run a different start command. You can use the `start-windows` parameter for this.\n\n```yml\nname: With server\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          # Linux and MacOS\n          start: npm start\n          # Takes precedences on Windows\n          start-windows: npm run start:windows:server\n```\n\n[![start example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start.yml)\n\n**Note:** A server continues to run until the end of the GitHub workflow job that started it. At the end of the job the GitHub workflow runner executes a ""Complete job"" phase automatically where it terminates any server processes which are still running.\n\n### Start multiple servers\n\nYou can start multiple server processes. For example, if you have an API to start using `npm run api` and the web server to start using `npm run web` you can put those commands in `start` using comma separation.\n\n```yml\nname: With servers\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          start: npm run api, npm run web\n```\n\nYou can place the start commands in separate lines\n\n```yml\nwith:\n  start: |\n    npm run api\n    npm run web\n```\n\n[![start example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start.yml)\n\n### Wait-on\n\nIf you are starting a local server and it takes a while to start, you can add a parameter `wait-on` and pass url to wait for the server to respond.\n\n```yml\nname: After server responds\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          start: npm start\n          # quote the url to be safe against YML parsing surprises\n          wait-on: \'http://localhost:8080\'\n```\n\n[![wait-on example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-wait-on/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-wait-on.yml)\n\n[![Webpack Dev Server example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-webpack/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-webpack.yml) (also uses `wait-on`)\n\nBy default, `wait-on` will retry for 60 seconds. You can pass a custom timeout in seconds using `wait-on-timeout`.\n\n```yml\n- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    start: npm start\n    wait-on: \'http://localhost:8080/status\'\n    # wait for 2 minutes for the server to respond\n    wait-on-timeout: 120\n```\n\n\n\nYou can wait for multiple URLs to respond by separating urls with a comma\n\n```yml\n- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    # API runs on port 3050\n    # Web server runs on port 8080\n    start: npm run api, npm run web\n    # wait for all services to respond\n    wait-on: \'http://localhost:3050, http://localhost:8080\'\n```\n\nThe action will wait for the first url to respond, then will check the second url, and so on.\n\nYou can even use your own command (usually by using `npm`, `yarn`, `npx`) to wait for the server to respond. For example, if you want to use the [wait-on](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on) utility to ping the server and run the Cypress tests after the server responds:\n\n```yml\n- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    start: npm start\n    wait-on: \'npx wait-on --timeout 60000 http://localhost:3000\'\n```\n\nSee [example-wait-on.yml](.github/workflows/example-wait-on.yml) workflow file.\n\nIf this action times out waiting for the server to respond, please see [Debugging](#debugging) section in this README file.\n\n#### `wait-on` with Node.js 18+\n\nUnder Node.js version 18 and later, `wait-on` may fail to recognize that a `localhost` server is running. This affects development web servers which do not listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks.\n\n- Check your server documentation to see if it can be started using `0.0.0.0` (all addresses) and use this if available. If this option is not available or does not resolve the issue then carry on to the next steps:\n- If the action log shows that `wait-on` is failing to connect to `127.0.0.1`, replace `localhost` by `[::1]` (the IPv6 loopback address)\n- If the action log shows that `wait-on` is failing to connect to `::1`, replace `localhost` by `127.0.0.1` (the IPv4 loopback address)\n\n### Custom install command\n\nIf you want to overwrite the install command\n\n```yml\n- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    install-command: yarn --frozen-lockfile --silent\n```\n\nSee [example-install-command.yml](.github/workflows/example-install-command.yml) workflow file.\n\n### Command prefix\n\nYou can prefix the default test command using the `command-prefix` option. This is useful for example when running [Percy](https://docs.percy.io/docs/cypress), which requires the test command to be wrapped with `percy exec --`.\n\n```yml\nname: Visual\non: push\njobs:\n  e2e:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          start: npm start\n          # quote the url to be safe against YML parsing surprises\n          wait-on: \'http://localhost:8080\'\n          # the entire command will automatically be prefixed with ""npm""\n          # and we need the second ""npm"" to execute ""cypress run ..."" command line\n          command-prefix: \'percy exec -- npx\'\n```\n\n### Custom test command\n\nYou can overwrite the Cypress run command with your own command.\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\n    uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n  - name: Custom tests \xf0\x9f\xa7\xaa\n    uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n    with:\n      command: npm run e2e:ci\n```\n\n**Caution**: using the action parameter `command` causes multiple other parameters to be ignored including: `auto-cancel-after-failures`, `browser`, `ci-build-id`, `command-prefix`, `component`, `config`, `config-file`, `env`, `group`, `headed`, `parallel`, `project`, `publish-summary`, `quiet`, `record`, `spec` and `tag`.\n\nSee [example-custom-command.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-command.yml) file.\n\n### Custom build id\n\nYou can overwrite [`ci-build-id`](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization#Linking-CI-machines-for-parallelization-or-grouping) used to link separate machines running tests into a single parallel run.\n\n```yml\nname: Parallel\non: push\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        # run 3 copies of the current job in parallel\n        containers: [1, 2, 3]\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          parallel: true\n          group: \'Actions example\'\n          ci-build-id: \'${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}\'\n        env:\n          # pass the Cypress Cloud record key as an environment variable\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n**Tip:** see [Learn GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions), with sections on Expressions, Contexts and Environment variables.\n\n### Robust custom build id\n\nIf you re-run the GitHub workflow, if you use the same custom build id during recording, Cypress Cloud will cancel the run with ""Build already finished"" error. To avoid this, you need to generate a _new_ custom build id on every workflow re-run. A good solution showing in the [example-custom-ci-build-id.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-ci-build-id.yml) file is to run a common job first that just generates a new random ID. This ID can be used by the testing jobs to tie the build together. If the user re-runs the workflow a new unique build id is generated, allowing recording the new Cypress Cloud run.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  # single job that generates and outputs a common id\n  prepare:\n    outputs:\n      uuid: ${{ steps.uuid.outputs.value }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Generate unique ID \xf0\x9f\x92\x8e\n        id: uuid\n        # take the current commit + timestamp together\n        # the typical value would be something like\n        # ""sha-5d3fe...35d3-time-1620841214""\n        run: echo ""value=sha-$GITHUB_SHA-time-$(date +""%s"")"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n  smoke-tests:\n    needs: [\'prepare\']\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          parallel: true\n          ci-build-id: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.uuid }}\n        env:\n          # pass the Cypress Cloud record key as an environment variable\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.EXAMPLE_RECORDING_KEY }}\n```\n\nSee the [example-custom-ci-build-id.yml](.github/workflows/example-custom-ci-build-id.yml) for the full workflow.\n\n### Working directory\n\nIn a monorepo, the end-to-end or component test might be placed in a different sub-folder from the application itself.\n\nUsing a [Cypress legacy configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration) (Version 9 or earlier) the structure could look like this:\n\n```text\nrepo/\n  app/\n  app-test/\n    cypress/\n      fixtures/\n      integration/\n      plugins/\n      support/\n    cypress.json\n  package.json\n```\n\nFor End-to-End testing using a [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for Version 10 and later, the structure could look like this :\n\n```text\nrepo/\n  app/\n  app-test/\n    cypress/\n      e2e/\n      fixtures/\n      support/\n    cypress.config.js\n  package.json\n```\n\nSimilarly for Component Testing with a [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for Version 10 and later, the structure could look like this:\n\n```text\nrepo/\n  app/\n  app-test/\n    cypress/\n      component/\n      fixtures/\n      support/\n    cypress.config.js\n  package.json\n```\n\nYou can specify the `app-test` working directory when running Cypress tests using the `working-directory` parameter\n\n```yml\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          start: npm start\n          working-directory: app-test\n```\n\nSee [example-basic.yml](.github/workflows/example-basic.yml) for an End-to-End test example and [example-component-test.yml](.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) for a Component test example, using the parameter `working-directory`.\n\n### Subfolders\n\nSometimes Cypress and end-to-end tests have their own `package.json` file in a subfolder, like\n\n```text\nroot/\n  e2e/\n    (code for installing and running Cypress tests)\n    package.json\n    package-lock.json\n    cypress.json\n    cypress\n\n  (code for running the ""app"" with ""npm start"")\n  package.json\n  yarn.lock\n```\n\nIn that case you can combine this action with [bahmutov/npm-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install) action to install dependencies separately.\n\n```yml\nname: E2E\non: push\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Install root dependencies\n        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1\n\n      - name: Start server in the background\n        run: npm start &\n\n      # Cypress has its own package.json in folder ""e2e""\n      - name: Install Cypress and run tests\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: e2e\n```\n\nSee [cypress-gh-action-subfolders](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-subfolders) (legacy) for example.\n\n### pnpm\n\nThe package manager `pnpm` is not pre-installed in [GitHub Actions runner images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) (unlike `npm` and `yarn`): to install `pnpm` include [pnpm/action-setup](https://github.com/pnpm/action-setup) in your workflow. If the action finds a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, it uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/install) command `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` by default to install dependencies.\n\n```yaml\nname: example-basic-pnpm\non: push\njobs:\n  basic-pnpm:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Install pnpm\n        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2\n        with:\n          version: 7\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/basic-pnpm\n```\n\n[![pnpm example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-basic-pnpm/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-basic-pnpm.yml)\n\n### Yarn Classic\n\nIf a `yarn.lock` file is found, the action uses the [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) command `yarn --frozen-lockfile` by default to install dependencies.\n\n```yaml\nname: example-yarn-classic\non: push\njobs:\n  yarn-classic:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/yarn-classic\n```\n\n[![Yarn classic example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-yarn-classic/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-yarn-classic.yml)\n\n### Yarn Modern\n\nTo install dependencies using a `yarn.lock` file from [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn 2 and later) you need to override the default [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) installation command `yarn --frozen-lockfile`. You can do this by using the `install-command` parameter and specifying `yarn install` for example:\n\n```yaml\nname: example-yarn-modern\non: push\njobs:\n  yarn-modern:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/yarn-modern\n          install-command: yarn install\n```\n\nThis example covers the [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) configuration `nodeLinker: node-modules` which Yarn uses by default for projects updated from Yarn Classic. For `nodeLinker: pnp` see [Yarn Plug\'n\'Play](#yarn-plugnplay) below.\n(Note that `github-action` is not compatible with the `nodeLinker: pnpm` setting.)\n\n[![Yarn Modern example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-yarn-modern/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-yarn-modern.yml)\n\n### Yarn Plug\'n\'Play\n\nWhen using [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn 2 and later) with [Plug\'n\'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) enabled, you will need to use the `command` parameter to run [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/run) instead of [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npx).\n\n```yaml\nname: example-yarn-modern-pnp\non: push\njobs:\n  yarn-classic:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/yarn-modern-pnp\n          install-command: yarn install\n          command: yarn run --binaries-only cypress run\n```\n\nThis example covers the [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) configuration when `nodeLinker` is undefined or set to `nodeLinker: pnp` corresponding to Yarn Plug\'n\'Play. Yarn uses this by default for projects newly created with Yarn Modern.\n\n[![Yarn Plug\'n\'Play example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions/workflows/example-yarn-modern-pnp.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions/workflows/example-yarn-modern-pnp.yml)\n\n**Caution**: using the action parameter `command` causes multiple other parameters to be ignored. [See `command` section for more information.](#custom-test-command)\n\n### Yarn workspaces\n\nThis action should discover the Yarn workspaces correctly. For example, see folder [examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces](examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces) and workflow file [example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml](.github/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml)\n\n```yaml\nname: example-start-and-yarn-workspaces\non: push\njobs:\n  single:\n    # the example has Yarn workspace in its ""root"" folder\n    # examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces\n    # and tests in a subfolder like ""workspace-1""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          working-directory: examples/start-and-yarn-workspaces/workspace-1\n          build: yarn run build\n          start: yarn start\n          wait-on: \'http://localhost:5000\'\n```\n\n[![Yarn workspaces example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-start-and-yarn-workspaces.yml)\n\n### Custom cache key\n\nSometimes the default cache key does not work. For example, if you cannot share the Node modules across Node versions due to native extensions. In that case pass your own `cache-key` parameter.\n\n```yml\nname: End-to-end tests\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    # let\'s make sure our ""app"" works on several versions of Node\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node: [16, 18, 20]\n    name: E2E on Node v${{ matrix.node }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      # run Cypress tests and record them under the same run\n      # associated with commit SHA and just give a different group name\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          record: true\n          group: Tests on Node v${{ matrix.node }}\n          cache-key: node-v${{ matrix.node }}-on-${{ runner.os }}-hash-${{ hashFiles(\'yarn.lock\') }}\n        env:\n          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Node versions\n\nYou can run your tests across multiple Node versions.\n\n```yml\nname: Node versions\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node: [16, 18, 20]\n    name: E2E on Node v${{ matrix.node }}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n```\n\nSee the [Node.js](#nodejs) section for information about supported versions and usage of Node.js.\n\n[![Node versions example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-node-versions/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-node-versions.yml)\n\n### Split install and tests\n\nSometimes you may want to run additional commands between installation and tests. To enable this use the `install` and `runTests` parameters.\n\n```yml\nname: E2E\non: push\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          # just perform install\n          runTests: false\n      - run: yarn lint\n      - name: Run e2e tests\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          # we have already installed all dependencies above\n          install: false\n          # Cypress tests and config file are in ""e2e"" folder\n          working-directory: e2e\n```\n\nSee [cypress-gh-action-monorepo](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-monorepo) for a working example.\n\n### Custom install\n\nFinally, you might not need this GH Action at all. For example, if you want to split the npm dependencies installation from the Cypress binary installation, then it makes no sense to use this action. Instead you can install and cache Cypress yourself. See [cypress-gh-action-split-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-split-install) (legacy) for a working example.\n\n### Install Cypress only\n\nIf the project has many dependencies, but you want to install just Cypress you can combine this action with `actions/cache` and `npm i cypress` commands yourself.\n\n```yml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/cache@v2\n  with:\n    path: |\n      ~/.cache/Cypress\n      node_modules\n    key: my-cache-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'package-lock.json\') }}\n- run: npm i cypress\n- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  with:\n    install: false\n```\n\n[![Install only Cypress example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-install-only/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-install-only.yml)\n\n### Timeouts\n\nYou can tell the CI to stop the job or the individual step if it runs for longer then a given time limit. This is a good practice to ensure the hanging process does not accidentally use up all your CI minutes.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    # stop the job if it runs over 10 minutes\n    # to prevent a hanging process from using all your CI minutes\n    timeout-minutes: 10\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        # you can specify individual step timeout too\n        timeout-minutes: 5\n```\n\nSee [cypress-gh-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-example) (legacy).\n\n### More examples\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n| Name                                                                                                    | Description                                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink)     | Runs every API command in Cypress using various CI platforms including GitHub Actions     |\n| [cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)                 | A real-world example payment application.

Ensure that exactly one type of lock file is used for each project or working-directory from the following supported package managers:\n\n | Lock file           | Package Manager                                                                                  | Installation command             |\n | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |\n | `package-lock.json` | [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-ci)                                             | `npm ci`                         |\n | `pnpm-lock.yaml`    | [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/install#--frozen-lockfile)                                            | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |\n | `yarn.lock`         | [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install#toc-yarn-install-frozen-lockfile) | `yarn --frozen-lockfile`         |\n\nSee section [Yarn Modern](#yarn-modern) for information about using Yarn version 2 and later.\n\n## Debugging\n\nThis action uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module to output additional verbose logs. You can see these debug messages by setting the following environment variable:\n\n```\nDEBUG: @cypress/github-action\n```\n\nYou can set the environment variable using GitHub UI interface, or in the workflow file:\n\n```yml\n- name: Cypress tests with debug logs\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  env:\n    DEBUG: \'@cypress/github-action\'\n```\n\nSee the [example-debug.yml](.github/workflows/example-debug.yml) workflow file.\n\n### Logs from the test runner\n\nThe above `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` setting enables the debug logs from the action itself. To see the [Cypress debug logs](http://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting#Print-DEBUG-logs) add an environment variable to the action:\n\n```yml\n- name: Cypress tests with debug logs\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  env:\n    DEBUG: \'cypress:*\'\n```\n\n### Debugging waiting for URL to respond\n\nIf you have a problem with `wait-on` not working, you can check the [src/ping.js](src/ping.js) logic from the local machine.\n\n- clone this repository to the local machine\n- install dependencies with `npm install`\n- start your server\n- from another terminal call the `ping` yourself to validate the server is responding:\n\n```\n$ node src/ping-cli.js <url>\n```\n\nFor example\n\n```\n$ node src/ping-cli.js https://example.cypress.io\npinging url https://example.cypress.io for 30 seconds\n::debug::pinging https://example.cypress.io has finished ok\n```\n\n## More information\n\n- Read our blog post [Drastically Simplify Testing on CI with Cypress GitHub Action](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/11/20/drastically-simplify-your-testing-with-cypress-github-action/)\n- Read [Test the Preview Vercel Deploys](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/develop-preview-test/) blog post\n- [Creating actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions) docs\n\n## Extras\n\n### Manual trigger\n\nIf you add `workflow_dispatch` event to your workflow, you will be able to start the workflow by clicking a button on the GitHub page, see the [Test External Site Using GitHub Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TeSOj2Iy_Q) video.\n\n### Outputs\n\nThis action sets a GitHub step output `resultsUrl` if the run was recorded on [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction) using the action parameter setting `record: true` (see [Record test results on Cypress Cloud](#record-test-results-on-cypress-cloud)). Note that using a [Custom test command](#custom-test-command) with the `command` parameter overrides the `record` parameter and in this case no `resultsUrl` step output is saved.\n\nThis is an example of using the step output `resultsUrl`:\n\n```yml\n- name: Cypress tests\n  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n  # let\'s give this action an ID so we can refer\n  # to its output values later\n  id: cypress\n  # Continue the build in case of an error, as we need to set the\n  # commit status in the next step, both in case of success or failure\n  continue-on-error: true\n  with:\n    record: true\n  env:\n    CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.RECORDING_KEY }}\n- name: Print Cypress Cloud URL\n  run: |\n    echo Cypress finished with: ${{ steps.cypress.outcome }}\n    echo See results at ${{ steps.cypress.outputs.resultsUrl }}\n```\n\nThe GitHub step output `dashboardUrl` is deprecated. Cypress Dashboard is now [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction).\n\n[![recording example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-recording/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-recording.yml)\n\n**Note:** every GitHub workflow step can have `outcome` and `conclusion` properties. See the GitHub [Contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts) documentation section [steps context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#steps-context). In particular, the `outcome` or `conclusion` value can be `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, or `skipped` which you can use in any following steps.\n\n### Print Cypress info\n\nSometimes you might want to print Cypress and OS information, like the list of detected browsers. You can use the [`cypress info`](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-info) command for this.\n\nIf you are NOT using the `build` command in your project, you can run the `cypress info` command:\n\n```yml\nname: info\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          build: npx cypress info\n```\n\nIf you are already using the `build` parameter, you can split the [installation and the test steps](#split-install-and-tests) and insert the `cypress info` command in between:\n\n```yml\nname: info\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress install\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          # just perform install\n          runTests: false\n      - name: Cypress info\n        run: npx cypress info\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          # we have already installed all dependencies above\n          install: false\n          # rest of your parameters\n```\n\n### Nightly tests\n\nSometimes you want to execute the workflow on a schedule. For example, to run Cypress tests nightly, you can schedule the workflow using `cron` syntax:\n\n```yml\nname: example-cron\non:\n  schedule:\n    # runs tests every day at 4am\n    - cron: \'0 4 * * *\'\njobs:\n  nightly:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress nightly tests \xf0\x9f\x8c\x83\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n```\n\n[![cron example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-cron/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-cron.yml)\n\n### Suppress test summary\n\nThe default test summary can be suppressed by using the parameter `publish-summary` and setting its value to `false`.\nSometimes users want to publish test summary using a specific action.\nFor example, a user running Cypress tests using a matrix and wants to retrieve the test summary for each matrix job and use a specific action that merges reports.\n\n```yml\nname: Example no summary\non: push\njobs:\n  cypress-run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Cypress run\n        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5\n        with:\n          publish-summary: false\n```\n\n## Node.js\n\n### Support\n\nNode.js is required to run this action. The current version `v5` supports:\n\n- **Node.js** 16.x\n- **Node.js** 18.x\n- **Node.js** 20.x and above\n\nand is generally aligned with [Node.js\'s release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).\n\n### Usage\n\n`github-action` command-type options such as [`install-command`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#custom-install-command), [`build`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#build-app), [`start`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#start-server) and [`command`](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#custom-test-command) are executed with the runner\'s version of Node.js. You can use GitHub\'s [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) to install an explicit Node.js version into the runner.\n\n[![Node versions example](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/example-node-versions/badge.svg?branch=master)](.github/workflows/example-node-versions.yml)\n\nCypress itself runs with a fixed Node.js version specified by the [runs.using](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions) parameter of [action.yml](action.yml). For `github-action@v5` this is `node16`.\n\n## Changelog\n\nView the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) document for an overview of version changes.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- `v5` is the recommended version of [cypress-io/github-action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action)\n- `v4` is the minimum version required for Cypress `10.x` and later\n\nPay attention to any GitHub Actions deprecation warnings shown in logs which may recommend updating.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see our [Contributing Guideline](./CONTRIBUTING.md) which explains how to contribute fixes or features to the repo and how to test.\n\n## License\n\n[![license][license-badge]][license-file]\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT license][license-file].\n\n<!-- badge links follow -->\n[ci-badge]: https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master\n[ci-workflow]: https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions/workflows/main.yml\n[cloud-badge]: https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://cloud.cypress.io/badge/simple/3tb7jn/master&style=flat&logo=cypress\n[cloud-project]: https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/3tb7jn/runs\n[renovate-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/renovate-app-blue.svg\n[renovate-bot]: https://github.com/renovatebot\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg\n[license-file]: ./LICENSE.md\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If a label name changes, the previous label is deleted by default.\nAlso all existing labels which not listed in `manifest` will be deleted by default.\nAll issues and PRs that were previously labeled with this label are now unlabeled.\n\nYou can add `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with.prune: false` in order to preserver all existing labels which is not mentioned in `manifest`, in this case when a label will be renamed old label will be not deleted.\n\n## Sync labels on another repository\n\nIt is also possible to specify a repository or repositories as an input to the action. This is useful if you want to store your labels somewhere centrally and modify multiple repository labels.\n\n**Note: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not have permissions to operate on other repositories so you must specify a personal access token in your secrets.**\n\n```yaml\nname: Sync labels\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      -

354,"b""# Python for Actions\nThis repository contains the code and scripts that we use to build Python packages used in [runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) and accessible through the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) Action.\nFile [versions-manifest.json](./versions-manifest.json) contains the list of available and released versions.\n\n> Caution: this is prepared for and only permitted for use by actions `runner-images` and `setup-python` action.\n\nSome versions are pre-installed on [runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) images.\nMore versions are available to install on-the-fly through the [`setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.\n\n## Building installation packages\n**Ubuntu:** The official Python sources are downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/), built using the `make` tool, and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation. We build each Python version against all [versions of Ubuntu](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) that are available at the time the Python version is released.\n\n**macOS:** \n- For **Python < 3.11**, the official Python sources are downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/), built using the `make` tool, and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.  For backward compatibility, we build each Python version against the oldest [version of macOS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) that is available at the time the Python version is released.\n- For **Python >= 3.11**, the official macOS `universal2` Python binaries are simply downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.\n\n**Windows:** The official Python executables are simply downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) and archived along with the installation script for further distribution and installation.\n\n## Support policy\nWe aim to make new versions of Python available as soon as they are released. Both stable and prerelease versions are considered for building and releasing. Please open an issue in [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) if a version you're looking for isn't available.\n\nWhen a new version of an operating system is released and made available for use with [GitHub hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources), we will provide the **latest existing patch versions of Python for all major versions that have not reached [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/)**.

See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.\n\n| Name | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` |\n| `commit-message` | The message to use when committing changes. | `[create-pull-request] automated change` |\n| `committer` | The committer name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. | `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` |\n| `author` | The author name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. | `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>` |\n| `signoff` | Add [`Signed-off-by`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. | `false` |\n| `branch` | The pull request branch name. | `create-pull-request/patch` |\n| `branch-suffix` | The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are `random`, `timestamp` and `short-commit-hash`. See [Alternative strategy](#alternative-strategy---always-create-a-new-pull-request-branch) for details. | |\n| `base` | Sets the pull request base branch. | Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow. |\n| `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork\'s branch into the parent\'s base. See [push pull request branches to a fork](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details. | |\n| `title` | The title of the pull request. | `Changes by create-pull-request action` |\n| `body` | The body of the pull request. | `Automated changes by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub action` |\n| `labels` | A comma or newline-separated list of labels. | |\n| `assignees` | A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames). | |\n| `reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from. | |\n| `team-reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) may be required. See [this issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/155). | |\n| `milestone` | The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with. | |\n| `draft` | Create a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). | `false` |\n\n### Action outputs\n\nThe pull request number is output as a step output.\nNote that in order to read the step output the action step must have an id.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3\n      - name: Check outputs\n        run: |\n          echo ""Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}""\n```\n\n### Checkout\n\nThis action expects repositories to be checked out with `actions/checkout@v2`.\n\nIf there is some reason you need to use `actions/checkout@v1` the following step can be added to checkout the branch.\n\n```yml\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - run: git checkout ""${GITHUB_REF:11}""\n```\n\n### Action behaviour\n\nThe default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.\nChanges are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.\nAny subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.\n\nHow the action behaves:\n\n- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.\n- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.\n- If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.\n- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the base and pull request branch), the pull request is automatically closed and the branch deleted.\n\nFor further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).\n\n#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch\n\nFor some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.\nThis strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.\n\nTo use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.\n\n- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`\n\n- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`\n\n- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`\n\n### Controlling commits\n\nAs well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.\n\n```yml\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Create commits\n        run: |\n          git config user.name \'Peter Evans\'\n          git config user.email \'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          date +%s > report.txt\n          git commit -am ""Modify tracked file during workflow""\n          date +%s > new-report.txt\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Add untracked file during workflow""\n      - name: Uncommitted change\n        run: date +%s > report.txt\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3\n```\n\n### Ignoring files\n\nIf there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.\n\n### Create a project card\n\nTo create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3\n\n      - name: Create or Update Project Card\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1\n        with:\n          project-name: My project\n          column-name: My column\n          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}\n```\n\n## Reference Example\n\nThe following workflow is a reference example that sets many of the main inputs.\n\nSee [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.\n\n```yml\nname: Create Pull Request\non: push\njobs:\n  createPullRequest:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Make changes to pull request\n        run: date +%s > report.txt\n\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commit-message: Update report\n          committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com>\n          author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>\n          signoff: false\n          branch: example-patches\n          title: \'[Example] Update report\'\n          body: |\n            Update report\n            - Updated with *today\'s* date\n            - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1]\n\n            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request\n          labels: |\n            report\n            automated pr\n          assignees: peter-evans\n          reviewers: peter-evans\n          team-reviewers: |\n            owners\n            maintainers\n          milestone: 1\n          draft: false\n\n      - name: Check output\n        run: |\n          echo ""Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}""\n```\n\nAn example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:\n\n![Pull Request Example](docs/assets/pull-request-example.png)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
359,"b""# Include Guards Check (GitHub Action)\n\nThis is a [GitHub Action](//help.github.com/en/actions) to check for\n`#include` guards in C/C++ header files.\n\nWe consider files with extensions `.h`, `.H`, `.hh`, `.hpp`, and `.hxx`\nas header files.\nIn these files we check for the existence of constructs like\n```c\n#ifndef SOME_NAME\n#define SOME_NAME\n```\nwhere `SOME_NAME` is based on the file name according to a pattern\nthat can be specified by the user.\n\nNote that we do not really parse the preprocessor code, we just perform\nsimple shell scripting.\nThat means, you can easily trick the check script into false positives.\nHowever, why should you do that?\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `path`\n\nThe base path to look for header files,\nfor example `src` or `include`.\n\nDefault is the root of the repository, i.e., `.`.\n\n### `pattern`\n\nThe pattern to construct the macro name based on the file name.\n\nThe pattern is a simple string with some replacement fields, i.e.,\nsubstrings in curly braces that will be replaced by (user-specified)\nand *macrofied* parts of the file name.\n*Macrofication* means that we transform all lower-case letters to\nupper-case and replace all non-alphanumeric characters by underscores (`_`).\n\nHere is a list of available replacement field specifiers with an example for\nthe file `dir1/dir2/dir3/file.fuzz.hpp`:\n\n * **{path}**: `DIR1_DIR2_DIR3_FILE_FUZZ_HPP`\n * **{file}**: `FILE_FUZZ_HPP`\n * **{file_ext}**: `HPP`\n * **{file_base}**: `FILE_FUZZ`\n * **{dirs}**: `DIR1_DIR2_DIR3`\n * **{first_dir}**: `DIR1`\n * **{last_dir}**: `DIR3`\n\nNote that it is always useful to use your project name as a prefix\nto avoid name clashes with header guards of other projects.\n\nDefault is `{path}`, which is useful if your path structure is\nlike `<project name>/<header file>` or\n`<project name>/<some category>/<header file>`.\n\n### `only`\n\nThe regular expression for paths to check.\nPaths not matching this regular expression are ignored.\n\nThree artificial examples:\n * `dir/\\(foo\\|bar\\)\\.h` checks `dir/foo.h` and `dir/bar.h` only,\n * `^v[0-9\\.]\\+/` checks paths beginning with a versional directory only,\n * `/.*/` checks paths with at least two directories only.\n\nBy default, all paths are checked.\n\n### `ignore`\n\nThe regular expression for paths to ignore.\nThis is possibly a simpler way (than using `only`) to exclude\nfiles from checking.\n\nBy default, no paths are ignored.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `fails`\n\nA space-separated list of files for which the check failed.\n\n## Example usage\n\nCreate a workflow file, e.g., `.github/workflows/include-guards.yml`,\nwith the following content:\n```yml\nname: check-include-guards\n\non: [push, pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  include-guards:\n    name: Check include guards\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Check include guards\n      uses: sbeyer/include-guards-check-action@v1.0.0\n      with:\n        path: 'include/'\n        pattern: 'PROJECT_{last_dir}_{file_base}'\n```\n\nYou can also [glance at other projects using this GitHub Action](//github.com/search?l=YAML&q=include-guards-check-action&type=Code).\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Supports Slack\'s required arguments as well as all the optional once. It\'s JavaScript-based and thus fast to run.\n\nThe goal is to have zero npm/yarn dependencies except the two from Github that is required for an action to work (@actions/core & @actions/github).\n\n![Slack result](./images/slack-result.png ""Slack result"")\n\nThis action is just an HTTPS call to Slack API, so you can easily build this by yourself, or use this action or any one of the hundred other Slack actions available.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Slack Workspace and Channel(s)\n1. A Slack App and Bot - the App and Bot will be used to send messages to your channel. It sounds hard, but it\'s not :)\n1. A Github Action - the place where you wants to send Slack messages\n1. Github Secret - the Slack Bot auth token, used when posting messages to Slack API\n\n## Important\n\nWith the latest changes to Slack API, please use channel id instead of channel name. E.g. use `CPPUV5KU0` instead of `test` (You can find the ID in the API calls or https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40940327/what-is-the-simplest-way-to-find-a-slack-team-id-and-a-channel-id)\n\n## Setup\n\nThis action supports:\n\n- 1.

Create a Slack bot\n\nFollow this guide on how to create a Slack App and Bot for your workspace:\n\n- https://slack.com/intl/en-se/help/articles/115005265703-create-a-bot-for-your-workspace\n\nYou should:\n\n1. Create a new Slack App, https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1\n1. Go to ""Basic Information"" > ""Display Information"" > ""App icon & Preview"" and add avatar for you App. This will be shown in Slack when you receive messages\n1. Go to ""Bot User"" > ""Add"" and add a bot user to your Slack App\n1. Go to ""Install App"" > ""Install App to Workspace"" to install your Slack App into your Slack workspace\n1. Done\n\n### 2. Save Bot Access Token on Github\n\nTo be able to send messages to slack, the Action needs the Auth Token for the Slack App. Since the Auth Token is sensitive information, you should NOT place it in the yaml file of the Action, but instead in the Github Secrets area.\n\n1. Go to your App on Slack, https://api.slack.com/apps/\n1. Go to ""OAuth & Permissions"" > ""Bot User OAuth Access Token""\n1. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`\n1. Go to your Github Repo\n1. Go to ""Settings"" > ""Secrets"" for the repo\n1. Create a new secret called `SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the value from `Bot User OAuth Access Token`\n1. Done\n\n### 2. Create a new Github Action\n\n1. Go to your github repo\n1. Go to actions\n1. Create a new one, you can use the samples above\n\n## Q&A\n\n### It\'s not working\n\nPlease look at the individual steps on your Github Action. Maybe you have forgotten to set Channel or Token:\n\n![Sample Error](./images/sample-error.png ""Sample Error"")\n\nTo debug action and see what payload is being sent to slack, enable debugging: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-debug-logging (`ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true` and `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true` under `Settings > Secrets`)\n\n### What information about the repo etc is available?\n\nYou can easily print everything you have while running the action. It can be a good way to see what you can send to Slack.\n\n```\non: push\n\njobs:\n  one:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Dump GitHub context\n        env:\n          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}\n        run: echo ""$GITHUB_CONTEXT""\n      - name: Dump job context\n        env:\n          JOB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(job) }}\n        run: echo ""$JOB_CONTEXT""\n      - name: Dump steps context\n        env:\n          STEPS_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(steps) }}\n        run: echo ""$STEPS_CONTEXT""\n      - name: Dump runner context\n        env:\n          RUNNER_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(runner) }}\n        run: echo ""$RUNNER_CONTEXT""\n      - name: Dump strategy context\n        env:\n          STRATEGY_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(strategy) }}\n        run: echo ""$STRATEGY_CONTEXT""\n      - name: Dump matrix context\n        env:\n          MATRIX_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(matrix) }}\n        run: echo ""$MATRIX_CONTEXT""\n```\n\nFrom: https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions\n\n### Why JavaScript and not Shell/etc?\n\n_""JavaScript actions can run directly on any of the GitHub-hosted virtual machines, and separate the action code from the environment used to run the code. Using a JavaScript action simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action.""_\n(https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-actions)\n\n### How does the Action JavaScript code work\n\nIt\'s simple, it just takes all the parameters and does an HTTPS POST to api.slack.com.\n\n### I want another avatar to be used in Slack\n\nBy default the avatar in Slack will be the same as for the Slack App you created. If you want to change this based on action, look at the https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage `icon_emoji` parameter.\n\n### Why did you build your own?\n\nIt was a good way to learn more about Github Actions\n\n### Why should I use this?\n\nThis action is just an HTTPS POST to Slack API, so you can easily build this by yourself, or use this, or use any other action available on the marketplace :)\n\n## Development and testing\n\nSee package.json for `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, etc.\n\nRemember to create the dist with `yarn build`.\n\nTo run local integration test (from this repository):\n\n```\nenv BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN> CHANNEL=<YOUR CHANNEL> node integration-test/end-to-end.js\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
362,"b'# Sphinx Build Action\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ammaraskar/sphinx-action.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ammaraskar/sphinx-action)\n[![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ammaraskar/sphinx-action/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ammaraskar/sphinx-action)\n\n\nThis is a Github action that looks for Sphinx documentation folders in your\nproject. It builds the documentation using Sphinx and any errors in the build\nprocess are bubbled up as Github status checks.\n\nThe main purposes of this action are:\n\n* Run a CI test to ensure your documentation still builds. \n\n* Allow contributors to get build errors on simple doc changes inline on Github\n  without having to install Sphinx and build locally.\n  \n![Example Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Gk2W32O.png)\n\n## How to use\n\nCreate a workflow for the action, for example:\n\n```yaml\nname: ""Pull Request Docs Check""\non: \n- pull_request\n\njobs:\n  docs:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n    - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master\n      with:\n        docs-folder: ""docs/""\n```\n\n* If you have any Python dependencies that your project needs (themes, \nbuild tools, etc) then place them in a requirements.txt file inside your docs\nfolder.\n\n* If you have multiple sphinx documentation folders, please use multiple\n  `uses` blocks.\n\nFor a full example repo using this action including advanced usage, take a look\nat https://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action-test\n\n## Great Actions to Pair With\n\nSome really good actions that work well with this one are\n[`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)\nand [`ad-m/github-push-action`](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action).\n\nYou can use these to make built HTML and PDFs available as artifacts:\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1\n      with:\n        name: DocumentationHTML\n        path: docs/_build/html/\n```\n\nOr to push docs changes automatically to a `gh-pages` branch:\n\n<details><summary>Code for your workflow</summary>\n<p>\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Commit documentation changes\n      run: |\n        git clone https://github.com/your_git/repository.git --branch gh-pages --single-branch gh-pages\n        cp -r docs/_build/html/* gh-pages/\n        cd gh-pages\n        git config --local user.email ""action@github.com""\n        git config --local user.name ""GitHub Action""\n        git add .\n        git commit -m ""Update documentation"" -a || true\n        # The above command will fail if no changes were present, so we ignore\n        # the return code.\n    - name: Push changes\n      uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master\n      with:\n        branch: gh-pages\n        directory: gh-pages\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\nFor a full fledged example of this in action take a look at:\nhttps://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action-test\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\nIf you wish to customize the command used to build the docs (defaults to\n`make html`), you can provide a `build-command` in the `with` block. For\nexample, to invoke sphinx-build directly you can use:\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master\n      with:\n        docs-folder: ""docs/""\n        build-command: ""sphinx-build -b html . _build""\n```\n\nIf there\'s system level dependencies that need to be installed for your\nbuild, you can use the `pre-build-command` argument like so:\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: ammaraskar/sphinx-action@master\n      with:\n        docs-folder: ""docs2/""\n        pre-build-command: ""apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y latexmk texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended""\n        build-command: ""make latexpdf""\n```\n\n## Running the tests\n\n`python -m unittest`\n\n## Formatting\n\nPlease use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting:\n\n`black entrypoint.py sphinx_action tests`\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Among other\nthings, these are used by the Snap Store\'s automatic security\nvulnerability scanner to check whether your snap includes files from\nvulnerable versions of Ubuntu packages.\n\nThis can be turned off by setting the `build-info` parameter to\n`false`.\n\n### `snapcraft-channel`\n\nBy default, the action will install Snapcraft from the stable\nchannel.  If your project relies on a feature not found in the stable\nversion of Snapcraft, then the `snapcraft-channel` parameter can be\nused to select a different channel.\n\n### `snapcraft-args`\n\nThe `snapcraft-args` parameter can be used to pass additional\narguments to Snapcraft.  This is primarily intended to allow the use\nof experimental features by passing `--enable-experimental-*`\narguments to Snapcraft.\n\n### `ua-token`\n\nThe `ua-token` parameter can be used to tell Snapcraft to attach an Ubuntu\nAdvantage (UA) token inside the build environment. Snapcraft will ensure\nthe token is detached before exiting, but be warned that it is possible\nsome failures may prevent detaching (e.g. aborted jobs).\n\nIn order to make the UA token available to the workflow, it should be stored\nas a repository secret:\n\n1. choose the ""Settings"" tab.\n2. choose ""Secrets"" from the menu on the left.\n3. click ""Add a new secret"".\n4. set the name to `UA_TOKEN` (or whatever is referenced in the workflow),\n   and paste the UA token as the value.\n\nNote that repository secrets are not available to workflows triggered\nby pull requests to public repositories.\n\nAn example workflow with UA token stored as secret `UA_TOKEN`:\n\n```yaml\n...\n    - uses: snapcore/action-build@v1\n      with:\n        ua-token: ${{ secrets.UA_TOKEN }}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

370,"b'# Jekyll Builder for GitHub Pages (Action)\n\nFast and simple [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) based on the official [Jekyll Docker](https://github.com/jekyll/docker) `builder` image for building a Jekyll site and optionally deploying that site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n\n* **Lightweight for fast builds.** The action\'s container image weighs in at ~80MB smaller than many comparable others.\n* **Minimal configuration.** Smart defaults are automatically pulled from your GitHub account via the [GitHub v3 REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).\n* **Observable and debug-able**. Clear logs with plenty of hints for what to do when a commit breaks the build. Debug the action itself just by running it with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `""true""`.\n* **Batteries included**. Based on the official `jekyll/builder` Docker image so dependencies are always there when you need them.\n* **Automatic updates**. Never update your pipeline manually if you don\'t want to. If you do, specify a version-pinned ref in your workflow for guaranteed stability.\n* **Highlighy customizable**. Run custom commands before or after your build to easily smooth over any edge cases.\n* **Pipeline-ready.** Safe for Continuous Delivery workflows because only real issues, not no-ops, cause build errors. \n\nThis Action was created to be fast, simple, and versatile. It ships with smart defaults that are augmented at runtime with data pulled from the GitHub API, so you can keep your workflow file short and readable instead of spending time setting configuration inputs just to get the basics done. Use all the feautures of the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image and, if you need even more power, granting the action more privileges (by adding scopes to a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) used as the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable) will make it do more of the right things, automatically.\n\n# Usage\n\nIn one of your [GitHub Actions workflow files](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file), add the following as [a step in a job](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):\n\n```yaml\n- name: Build Jekyll site.\n  uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@v1 # Or whatever ""@ref"" you want.\n```\n\nThat\'s it. The action will use whatever source code is checked out from a previous [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) step as the Jekyll source to build. If the build succeeds, the step passes and the job continues with the next step.\n\nFor more details, see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-actions-from-github-marketplace-in-your-workflow). For more common use cases, notably deploying to GitHub Pages, see [\xc2\xa7 Examples](#examples).\n\n## Choosing a ref\n\nUse the following guidance when choosing which ref (version) you want to base your work on:\n\n* `v1` - This references the latest available 1.x.x version of the Action, which conforms with semantic versioning compatibility conventions. Use this ref in your workflow to gain backwards-compatible enhancements automatically. These versions will all be based on the upstream `jekyll/builder` Docker image\'s `latest` tag.\n* `builder-3.8` - This reference is based on `jekyll/builder:3.8` and is considered a stable, legacy release. Use this ref in your workflow to stick to the given upstream tag.\n\n## Inputs\n\nYou can customize this action by [using input variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).  Moreover,  *all inputs are optional*, so the action will still build your Jekyll site without any additional configuration. To enable deployments to GitHub Pages and other advanced features, some inputs are required as described below.\n\nFor additional details, inputs are well-commented in [the action\'s metadata file (`action.yaml`)](action.yaml).\n\n### `gh_pages_publishing_source`\n\nName of the branch your repository is using as its GitHub Pages publishing source. This is the branch in your GitHub repository to which the Action will commit the result of the Jekyll build. Note that to deploy on GitHub Pages, you *must* first enable GitHub Pages from your repository\'s Settings screen and choose a GitHub Pages publishing source branch before using this Action.\n\nWhen GitHub Pages is enabled, User and Organization repositories reserve the `master` branch as the GitHub Pages publishing source. This means you *must not* keep your own source code files in the `master` branch of User or Organization repositories when using this Action to automate deployments to GitHub Pages.\n\nBy default, this value is detected automatically if you have already [configured a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) in your repository settings and provided a [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable with appropriate permissions.\n\nThis option is ignored when the Action detects a [User or Organization repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites), because those types of GitHub Pages sites can only ever use their `master` branch as a publishing source. For Project repositories, this defaults to the value set in your repository\'s Settings screen (e.g., `gh-pages` branch).\n\n### `git_commit_message`\n\nWhen a commit to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch ([`gh_pages_publishing_source`](#gh_pages_publishing_source)) is made, this input variable defines the message to use. If none is specified, a generic default message will be used.\n\n### `git_committer_email`\n\nThe email address to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the email associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow if the access token passed as the [`secret_gh_pages_api_token`](#secret_gh_pages_api_token) input variable has permission to access that data. If not, it will default to `""${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com""`.\n\n### `git_committer_name`\n\nThe name to use for the committer when a commit is made to your GitHub Pages publishing source branch. This defaults to the display name associated with the GitHub account running the GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n### `jekyll_build_opts`\n\nExtra arguments to pass to [the `jekyll build` command](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). This is particularly useful if your site requires non-default Jekyll build behaviors to be enabled. For example, to publish future-dated posts on your blog:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    jekyll_build_opts: --future\n```\n\nSee the output of `jekyll build --help` for more options.\n\n### `pre_build_commands`\n\nSet this input variable to a shell command or short inline shell script, which will be executed prior to the build. This is particularly useful for ensuring bleeding-edge build dependencies that may be missing from the upstream Docker image are installed or up to date.\n\nFor example, the following configuration will run this action with the absolute latest version of the `bundle` command by executing `gem install bundler` before the Jekyll build is initiated.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    # Use a newer `bundle` command.\n    pre_build_commands: gem install bundler\n```\n\nA more complex script can be passed as a multi-line string using a [YAML literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/current.html#id2540046):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    pre_build_commands: |\n      echo ""Packaged bundler version: $(bundle --version)""\n      echo ""Updating bundler...""\n      gem install bundler\n```\n\n### `post_build_commands`\n\nExactly the same as [`pre_build_commands`](#pre_build_commands) except these commands run immediately following a (successful) build. Jekyll build failures will terminate execution of the action before these commands have a chance to run.\n\n### `secret_gh_pages_api_token`\n\nSet this input variable to the value of a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). This input variable is **required if you\'d like to use this action to publish your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages.** There is no default value.\n\nYou should always set this input variable by using the `secrets` expression context provided by GitHub Actions runners:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n  with:\n    secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_VARIABLE }}\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).\n\n## Outputs\n\n> :construction: TODO\n\nThe current version of this action does not produce any outputs. Hopefully, a future version will. :)\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section offers some complete workflow examples to show you how to make use of this action.\n\n### Deploying to GitHub Pages\n\nBy default, when the `secret_gh_pages_api_token` input variable is set, the action will deploy the Jekyll build to the GitHub Pages publishing source branch configured in your repository\'s GitHub Pages Settings section. This means you must first [configure a GitHub Pages publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source) before using this action to deploy a Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.\n\nThis input variable must be set to the value of a GitHub API personal access token granted the proper scopes (permissions). [Create such a token at your GitHub account\'s *Settings &rarr; Developer settings &rarr; Personal access tokens* page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,repo_deployment&description=GitHub%20Pages%20Deployment%20Token). Then navigate to your repository\'s Settings &rarr; Secrets screen and add a new secret whose value is exactly the same as the personal access token you created moments earlier. In the example configuration below, we assume you have created a repository secret named `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`.\n\n```yaml\n# In your repository\'s `.github/workflows/publish-to-github-pages.yaml` file.\n---\n# Name of your GitHub Actions workflow.\nname: Publish to GitHub Pages\n\n# Specifies to run this workflow whenever a push is made (commits are\n# added) to the branch named `jekyll`.\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n\n# Define a job named `build-and-publish` in your workflow.\njobs:\n  build-and-publish:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job uses a GitHub-hosted runner.\n\n    steps:\n      # Checkout the source from the `jekyll` branch.\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      # Invoke this action against the newly checked out source code.\n      - uses: fabacab/jekyll-builder-for-github-pages-action@master\n        with:\n          # Provide this action with your repository\'s `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`\n          # ""Secret"" variable. This should be the value of a personal\n          # access token granted, at a minimum, the `public_repo` and\n          # the `repo_deployment` scopes needed to deploy to GH Pages.\n          secret_gh_pages_api_token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAGES_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nUsing the above workflow file, anytime someone with the appropriate permissions pushes to the `jekyll` branch in your repository, this action will run. The `build-and-publish` job will `git checkout` the `jekyll` branch source code, which should contain your Jekyll site\'s source (not your generated HTML). Assuming the secret `GH_PAGES_TOKEN` contains a personal access token granted the sufficient permissions, the action will automatically detect the correct branch to `git commit` and `git push` your generated HTML to.\n\n#### Automatically rebuilding a GitHub Pages site\n\nYou can schedule your workflow to run this action in order to keep your (otherwise static) GitHub Pages site content fresh This is particularly useful if your Jekyll templates show different content based on the date or time of the build, such as featuring your organization\'s next calendar event on the site\'s home page. Enable scheduled builds by adding a `schedule` key in the `on` dictionary from the above example:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  # Automatically execute this workflow on a schedule.\n  schedule:\n    # POSIX-compatible cron syntax is supported.\n    - cron:  \'0 */12 * * *\' # Rebuild twice a day (every twelve hours on the hour).\n\n  # Also run this workflow whenever pushes are made to these branches, as before.\n  push:\n    branches:\n      # Change this to the branch where you keep your Jekyll code.\n      - jekyll\n```\n\nSee [Events that trigger workflows \xc2\xa7 Scheduled events: `schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule) for more information.\n\n# Support and Donations\n\nContributions are &hearts;ily welcomed.\n\nIn addition to contributing code, please consider sending some $ my way by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/fabacab/), at least until grocery stores begin offering free food. Donations for this and my other Free Software projects make up the bulk of my income.

Once login is done, the next set of actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- uses: azure/docker-login@v1\r\n  with:\r\n    login-server: '<login server>' # default: index.docker.io\r\n    username: '<username>'\r\n    password: '<password>'\r\n```\r\nRefer to the action metadata file for details about all the inputs: [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login/blob/master/action.yml)\r\n\r\nWhen using the docker-login action, ensure your login-server matches the fully qualified path to your image. You should omit login-server if you are pushing to the default docker hub without a host prefix, for instance, `docker push repo/image`.

Gatsby automatically defines\n> this script whenever you start a new project via `gatsby new`, which in turn calls\n> `gatsby build`.\n\n### Knobs & Handles\n\nThis Action is fairly simple but it does provide you with a couple of\nconfiguration options:\n\n- **access-token**: A [GitHub Personal Access Token][github-access-token] with\n  the `repo` scope. This is **required** to push the site to your repo after\n  Gatsby finish building it. You should store this as a [secret][github-repo-secret]\n  in your repository. Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n\n- **deploy-branch**: The branch expected by GitHub to have the static files\n  needed for your site. For org and user pages it should always be `master`.\n  This is where the output of `gatsby build` will be pushed to. Provided as an\n  [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to `master`.\n\n- **deploy-repo**: The repository expected by GitHub to have the static files\n  needed for your site.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to the same repository that runs this action.\n\n- **gatsby-args**: Additional arguments that get passed to `gatsby build`. See the\n  [Gatsby documentation][gatsby-build-docs] for a list of allowed options.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to nothing.\n\n- **skip-publish**: Builds your Gatsby site but skips publishing by setting it to `true`,\n  effectively performing a test of the build process using the live configuration.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to **false**\n\n- **working-dir**: The directory where your Gatsby source files are at. `gatsby build`\n  will run from this directory.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to the project\'s root.\n  \n- **git-config-name**: Provide a custom name that is used to author the git commit, which\n  is pushed to the deploy branch.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to the GitHub username of the action actor.\n\n- **git-config-email**: Provide a custom email that is used to author the git commit, which\n  is pushed to the deploy branch.\n  Provided as an [input][github-action-input].\n  Defaults to `{actor}@users.noreply.github.com`, where `{actor}` is the GitHub username \n  of the action actor.\n  \n### Org or User Pages\n\nCreate a repository with the format `<YOUR/ORG USERNAME>.github.io`, push your\nGatsby source code to a branch other than `master` and add this GitHub Action to\nyour workflow! \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\xf0\x9f\x98\x83\n\n### Repository Pages\n\nRepo pages give you the option to push your static site to either `master` or\n`gh-pages` branches. They also work a little different because the URL includes\na trailing path with the repository name, like\n`https://username.github.io/reponame/`. You need to tell Gatsby what the path\nprefix is via `gatsby-config.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  pathPrefix: ""/reponame"",\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you need to tell the `gatsby build` command to use it by passing\nthe `--prefix-paths` as an argument. Here\'s an example workflow for that:\n\n```yml\nname: Gatsby Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - dev\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action@v2\n        with:\n          access-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n          deploy-branch: gh-pages\n          gatsby-args: --prefix-paths\n```\n\nProvides build validation on `pull request` if required:\n\n```yml\nname: Gatsby Publish\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - dev\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action@v2\n        with:\n          access-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n          deploy-branch: gh-pages\n          gatsby-args: --prefix-paths\n          skip-publish: true\n```\n\n### CNAME\n\nYou have a custom domain you would like to use? Fancy! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e This Action\'s got you\ncovered! Assuming you have already set up your DNS provider as defined in the\n[GitHub Pages docs][github-pages-domain-docs], all we need next is a `CNAME`\nfile at the root of your project with the domain you would like to use. For\nexample:\n\n```CNAME\nimenrique.com\n```\n\n> Notice that it\'s **all capitals CNAME** \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a.\n\nThis is how GitHub keeps track of the domain you want to use. This action will\ncopy the file to the `public` directory generated by Gatsby before pushing your\nsite so that the domain is persisted between deploys.\n\n### Assumptions\n\nThis Action assumes that your Gatsby code sits at the root of your repository\nand `gatsby build` outputs to the `public` directory. As of this writing, Gatsby\ndoesn\'t provide a way to customize the build directory so this should be a safe\nassumption.\n\nAdditionally, a `build` script on `package.json` is expected for this Action to\nto work (as mentioned at the beginning). Ultimately, this is what calls `gatsby build`.\n\n## That\'s It\n\nHave fun building! \xe2\x9c\xa8\n\n[gatsby-build-docs]: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/#build\n[github-access-token]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token\n[github-action-input]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#inputs\n[github-pages-domain-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site\n[github-repo-secret]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If you want to release a release:\n\n1. Go to the relevant repository.\n1. Update local tags using `git fetch --tags`.\n1. Check `git tag` for the latest released version.\n1. Depending on whether this is a major (X+1.0.0), minor (X.Y+1.0), or patch (X.Y.Z+1) release:\n   - If this is a major or minor release, create a `release-X.Y` branch.\n   - If this is a patch release, check out the existing `release-X.Y` branch.\n1. Add a change log entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n1. Look for anywhere there is a list of version numbers, such as the Makefile, test files, or\n   others. In all those places, add your new version and add an issue to fix it so that the code\n   looks up all the relevant versions by their tags.\n1. Do your changes on this branch.\n1. Push the branch.\n1. Create a pull request for the branch.\n1. Wait for the pull request to build.\n1. Tag the final commit on the branch with `X.Y.Z`, for example, `1.10.2`.\n1. `git push origin TAG` with the tag created above.\n1. Verify that all the release jobs succeed.\n1. Wait for the package to appear in the [test repository](https://packagecloud.io/linz/test).\n1. Manually promote the package from the test repository to production.\n1. Wait for the pull request to build with the Debian packaging changelog commit and merge it.\n\nOnly at this point is it safe to rely on the new version, because dependee repositories rely on the\nstate of the `master` branch in their pipelines. :\'(\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

There is no need to pass it as `env` to steps, it will work globally.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe actions checks for local changes which can be\n\n1. Uncommitted changes such as created, updated or deleted files as shown by `git status`\n2. Local commits\n\nIf there are none, the action concludes with the ""neutral"" status\n\nIf there are changes, it does the following\n\n1. Sets `user.name` and `user.email` with `git config --global` based on the `author` input, unless it has been already set before.\n2. Looks for local changes with `git status`.\n3. Adds a new commit using the `commit-message` input if there are uncommitted changes.\n4. Pushes the local changes to remote using the branch configured in the `branch` input.\n5. Creates a pull request using the `title` and `body` inputs.

An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n### Inputs\n\n* `path` - A directory to store and save the cache\n* `key` - An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache\n* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of keys to use for restoring the cache if no cache hit occurred for key\n\n### Outputs\n\n* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key\n\n> See [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#Skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output\n\n### Example workflow\n\n```yaml\nname: Caching Primes\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    \n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n    - name: Cache Primes\n      id: cache-primes\n      uses: actions/cache@v1\n      with:\n        path: prime-numbers\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-primes\n\n    - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n      if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n      run: /generate-primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n    \n    - name: Use Prime Numbers\n      run: /primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n```\n\n## Ecosystem Examples\n\nSee [Examples](examples.md)\n\n## Cache Limits\n\nIndividual caches are limited to 400MB and a repository can have up to 2GB of caches. Once the 2GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.\n\n## Skipping steps based on cache-hit\n\nUsing the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.\n\nExample:\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n  - uses: actions/cache@v1\n    id: cache\n    with:\n      path: path/to/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n  \n  - name: Install Dependencies\n    if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n    run: /install.sh\n```\n\n> Note: The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)\n\n## Contributing\nWe would love for you to contribute to `@actions/cache`, pull requests are welcome!

Labels prefixed with an exclamation\n  mark (`!`) will block a pull request from being merged, when present.\n\n  For example, when `automerge,!wip,!work in progress` is given,\n  any pull requests with the labels `wip` or `work in progress` and any pull\n  requests _without_ the label `automerge` will not be merged.\n  Blocking labels take precedence, so if a pull request has both labels\n  `wip` and `automerge`, it will not be merged.\n\n  When an empty string (`""""`) is given, all pull requests will be merged.\n\n- `MERGE_REMOVE_LABELS`: The labels to automatically remove from a pull request\n  once it has been merged by the action. The default value is `""""`.\n\n  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels that will be removed.\n\n  When an empty string (`""""`) is given, no labels will be removed.\n\n- `MERGE_METHOD`: Which method to use when merging the pull request into\n  the base branch. Possible values are\n  [`merge`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges) (create a merge commit),\n  [`rebase`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)\n  (rebase all commits of the branch onto the base branch)\n  or [`squash`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)\n  (squash all commits into a single commit). The default option is `merge`.\n\n- `MERGE_METHOD_LABELS`: Set to allow labels to determine the merge method\n  (see `MERGE_METHOD` for possible values).\n  For example, `automerge=merge,autosquash=squash`. If no such label is present,\n  the method set by `MERGE_METHOD` will be used. The default value is `""""`.\n\n- `MERGE_METHOD_LABEL_REQUIRED`: Set to `""true""` to require one of the\n  `MERGE_METHOD_LABELS` to be set. The default value is `""false""`.\n\n- `MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message to use when merging the pull\n  request into the base branch. Possible values are `automatic` (use GitHub\'s\n  default message), `pull-request-title` (use the pull request\'s title),\n  `pull-request-description` (use the pull request\'s description),\n  `pull-request-title-and-description` or a literal\n  value with optional placeholders (for example `Auto merge {pullRequest.number}`).\n  The default value is `automatic`.\n\n- `MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE_REGEX`: When using a commit message containing the\n  PR\'s body, use the first capturing subgroup from this regex as the commit\n  message. Can be used to separate content that should go with the commit into\n  the code base\'s history from boilerplate associated with the PR (licensing\n  notices, check lists, etc). For example, `(.*)^---` would keep everything up\n  until the first 3-dash line (horizontal rule in MarkDown) from the commit\n  message. The default value is empty, which disables this feature.\n\n- `MERGE_FILTER_AUTHOR`: When set, only pull requests raised by this author\n  will be merged automatically.\n\n- `MERGE_FORKS`: Whether merging from external repositories is enabled\n  or not. By default, pull requests with branches from forked repositories will\n  be merged the same way as pull requests with branches from the main\n  repository. Set this option to `""false""` to disable merging of pull requests\n  from forked repositories. The default value is `""true""`.\n\n- `MERGE_RETRIES` and `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP`: Sometimes, the pull request check\n  runs haven\'t finished yet, so the action will retry the merge after some time.\n  The number of retries can be set with `MERGE_RETRIES`.\n  The default number of retries is `6` and setting it to `0` disables the retry logic.\n  `MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP` sets the time to sleep between retries, in milliseconds.\n  The default is `5000` (5 seconds) and setting it to `0` disables sleeping\n  between retries.\n\n- `MERGE_REQUIRED_APPROVALS`: Count of required approvals. The default is `0`.\n\n- `MERGE_DELETE_BRANCH`: Automatic deletion of branches does not work for all\n  repositories. Set this option to `""true""` to automatically delete branches\n  after they have been merged. The default value is `""false""`.\n\n- `MERGE_DELETE_BRANCH_FILTER`: A comma-separated list of branches that will not\n  be deleted. This is not the list of GitHub\'s protected branches, which are never\n  deleted, but an additional list of branches to protect. The default value is `""""`.\n\n- `MERGE_ERROR_FAIL`: Set this to `""true""` to have the action exit with error code `1`\n  when the pull request could not be merged successfully during a run.\n\n- `MERGE_READY_STATE`: The state(s) of a pull request for which to attempt a\n  merge. This option can be a comma-separated list of states that will be considered mergeable.\n  The default value is `clean,has_hooks,unknown,unstable`.\n\nThe following update options are supported:\n\n- `UPDATE_LABELS`: The labels that need to be present for a pull request to be\n  updated (using `UPDATE_METHOD`). The default value is `automerge`.\n\n  Note that updating will only happen when the option ""Require branches to be\n  up to date before merging"" is enabled in the branch protection rules.\n\n  This option can be a comma-separated list of labels, see the `MERGE_LABELS`\n  option for more information.\n\n- `UPDATE_METHOD`: Which method to use when updating the pull request\n  to the base branch. Possible values are `merge` (create a merge commit) or\n  `rebase` (rebase the branch onto the head of the base branch). The default\n  option is `merge`.\n\n  When the option is `rebase` and the [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\n  failed, the action will exit with error code 1. This will also be visible\n  in the pull request page, with a message like ""this branch has conflicts\n  that must be resolved"" and a list of conflicting files.\n\n- `UPDATE_RETRIES` and `UPDATE_RETRY_SLEEP`: Sometimes, the pull request check\n  runs haven\'t finished yet and the action doesn\'t know if an update is\n  necessary. To query the pull request state multiple times, the number of\n  retries can be set with `UPDATE_RETRIES`. The default number of retries is `1`\n  and setting it to `0` disables the retry logic.\n  `UPDATE_RETRY_SLEEP` sets the time to sleep between retries, in milliseconds.\n  The default is `5000` (5 seconds) and setting it to `0` disables sleeping\n  between retries.\n\nAlso, the following general options are supported:\n\n- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should always be `""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""`.\n  However, in some cases it can be useful to run this action as a certain user\n  (by default, it will run as `github-actions`). This can be useful if you want\n  to use the ""Restrict who can push to matching branches"" option in the branch\n  protection rules, for example.\n\n  To use this setting for manually providing a token, you need to create a\n  [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\n  for the user (make sure to check `public_repo` when it\'s a public repository\n  or `repo` when it\'s a private repository). All API requests (merge/rebase)\n  will then be executed as the specified user. The token should be kept secret,\n  so make sure to add it as secret, not as environment variable, in the GitHub\n  workflow file!\n\n- `PULL_REQUEST`: If provided, this action will attempt to merge the specified pull request. By default, it will attempt to use the pull request specified in the GitHub context. If a pull request number is provided via this input, this action will search in the current repo for the provided pull request number. If you want to merge a pull request in another repo, just provide the repo slug before the pull request number, like `Some-Org/Some-Repo/1234`\n\n- `BASE_BRANCHES`: If provided, the action will be restricted in terms of base branches. Can be comma-separated list of simple branch names (i.e `main,dev`).\n\nYou can configure the environment variables in the workflow file like this:\n\n```yaml\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n          MERGE_LABELS: ""automerge,!work in progress""\n          MERGE_REMOVE_LABELS: ""automerge""\n          MERGE_METHOD: ""squash""\n          MERGE_COMMIT_MESSAGE: ""pull-request-description""\n          MERGE_FORKS: ""false""\n          MERGE_RETRIES: ""6""\n          MERGE_RETRY_SLEEP: ""10000""\n          MERGE_REQUIRED_APPROVALS: ""0""\n          UPDATE_LABELS: """"\n          UPDATE_METHOD: ""rebase""\n          PULL_REQUEST: ""1234""\n```\n\n## Supported Events\n\nAutomerge can be configured to run for these events:\n\n* `check_run`\n* `check_suite`\n* `issue_comment`\n* `pull_request_review`\n* `pull_request_target`\n* `pull_request`\n* `push`\n* `repository_dispatch`\n* `schedule`\n* `status`\n* `workflow_dispatch`\n* `workflow_run`\n\nFor more information on when these occur, see the Github documentation on [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) and [their payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads).\n\n## Outputs\n\nThe action will provide two [outputs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs):\n\n* `mergeResult` - The result from the action run, one of `skipped`, `not_ready`, `author_filtered`, `merge_failed`, `merged`\n* `pullRequestNumber` - The pull request number (or `0`, if no pull request was affected)\n\nPlease note:\n\n1. When there are multiple pull requests affected, only the first one will be available in the output\n2. To access these outputs, your workflow configuration must define an `id` for the automerge-action step\n3. Unless a personal access token is used, this action will not trigger other actions, see [Limitations](#limitations)\n\nExample usage:\n\n```yaml\n    steps:\n      - id: automerge\n        name: automerge\n        uses: ""pascalgn/automerge-action@v0.15.6""\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n      - name: feedback\n        if: steps.automerge.outputs.mergeResult == ""merged""\n        run: |\n          echo ""Pull request ${{ steps.automerge.outputs.pullRequestNumber }} merged!""\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n- When a pull request is merged by this action, the merge will not trigger other GitHub workflows.\n  Similarly, when another GitHub workflow creates a pull request, this action will not be triggered.\n  This is because [an action in a workflow run can\'t trigger a new workflow run](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows). However, the [`workflow_run`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run) event is triggered as expected.\n- When [using a personal access token (PAT) to work around the above limitation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token), note that when the user issuing the PAT is an administrator and [branch restrictions do not include administrators](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-branch-restrictions), pull requests may be merged even if they are not mergeable for non-administrators (see [#65](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action/issues/65)).\n- Currently, there is no way to trigger workflows when the pull request branch\n  becomes out of date with the base branch. There is a request in the\n  [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/New-Trigger-is-mergable-state/m-p/36908).\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo run the action with full debug logging, update your workflow file as follows:\n\n```yaml\n      - name: automerge\n        uses: pascalgn/automerge-action@...\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n          LOG: ""TRACE""  # or ""DEBUG""\n```\n\nIf you need to further debug the action, you can run it locally.\n\nYou will need a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).\n\nThen clone this repository, create a file `.env` in the repository, such as:\n\n```\nGITHUB_TOKEN=""123abc...""\nURL=""https://github.com/pascalgn/repository-name/pull/123""\n```\n\nInstall dependencies with `yarn`, and finally run `yarn it` (or `npm run it`).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
396,"b""## MSP-Greg/actions-ruby  2020-04-19\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**This action is deprecated.**  Suggested replacement actions:\r\n\r\n[ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby) - use for installation of Ruby builds\r\n\r\n[MSP-Greg/setup-ruby-pkgs](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/setup-ruby-pkgs) - use when compile dependencies are needed\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Brief Summary\r\n\r\nThe action is compatible with [actions/setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby), and can be used with all OS's.\r\n\r\nWhen the OS is Windows, it installs current Ruby versions, and also allows one to run jobs based on Ruby 2.3 or master.  Simple MYS2/DevKit operations are also included.\r\n\r\nOthere OS's use the standard GitHub Actions Ruby versions.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe following runs 12 jobs (3 OS's, 4 Rubies).  On Windows, it updates the MSYS2/DevKit gcc tools and installs the proper version of OpenSSL.\r\n```yaml\r\njobs:\r\n  ci:\r\n    name: >-\r\n      Ruby: ${{ matrix.ruby }}  OS: ${{ matrix.os }}\r\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\r\n    strategy:\r\n      fail-fast: false\r\n      matrix:\r\n        os: [ 'ubuntu-18.04', 'macos', 'windows-latest' ]\r\n        ruby: [ '2.3.x', '2.4.x', '2.5.x', '2.6.x' ]\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: repo checkout\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          fetch-depth: 10\r\n      - name: Setup Ruby, update MSYS2\r\n        uses: MSP-Greg/actions-ruby@master\r\n        with:\r\n          ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby }}\r\n          base: update\r\n          mingw: openssl\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following runs jobs using current versions of Ruby 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, along with Ruby master.  It updates the gcc tools, and installs openssl & ragel.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nruns-on: 'windows-latest'\r\nstrategy:\r\n  matrix:\r\n    ruby: [ '2.4.x', '2.5.x', '2.6.x', '9.9.x' ]\r\nsteps:\r\n- name: Install Ruby, update MSYS2\r\n  uses: MSP-Greg/actions-ruby@master\r\n  with:\r\n    ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby }}\r\n    base: update\r\n    mingw: openssl ragel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following runs jobs using current versions of Ruby 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, along with Ruby master.  Other than adjusting the path for compiling extensions, nothing is done to MSYS2.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nruns-on: 'windows-latest'\r\nstrategy:\r\n  matrix:\r\n    ruby: [ '2.4.x', '2.5.x', '2.6.x', '9.9.x' ]\r\nsteps:\r\n- name: Install Ruby\r\n  uses: MSP-Greg/actions-ruby@master\r\n  with:\r\n    ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How long does it take?\r\n\r\nInstalling current Rubies takes about 10 seconds for the GitHub hosted Rubies, about 15 - 20 seconds for ruby-head.\r\n\r\nInstalling current Rubies and updating the gcc tools takes +/- 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\nThis repo contains a GitHub action that will install current Ruby x64-mingw32 versions for use with GitHub Actions Windows images.\r\n\r\nAs of 2019-10-28, the versions available are:\r\n```\r\nactions-ruby     default\r\nRuby 2.3.3       not available\r\nRuby 2.4.9        2.4.6\r\nRuby 2.5.7        2.5.5\r\nRuby 2.6.5        2.6.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nRuby master is also available, use '9.9.x' in the matrix.  At present, it is hosted on Appveyor, where it is built three times a day.  I intend to move it to GitHub in the near future.\r\n\r\nAll versions except master are RubyInstaller2 versions, with the html docs removed.  Removing the docs decreases the number of extracted files & folders by approx 2,400 items.\r\n\r\nThe matrix is compatible with the standard [`actions/setup-ruby@v1`](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby) action published by GitHub.\r\n\r\n### MSYS2 Issues\r\n\r\nActions' current mingw Rubies were built with gcc 8.3.0.  The DevKit/MSYS2 installs contain gcc 7.2.0. A new or updated MSYS2 installation uses gcc is 9.2.0.\r\n\r\nThe Ubuntu 16.04 Rubies were built with gcc 5.4.0, Ubuntu 18.04 Rubies were built with gcc 7.4.0.\r\n\r\nSo, if you'd like to use a curent gcc compiler, updating the MSYS2 gcc tools to 9.2.0 is the easiest way to do so.\r\n\r\nFor reference, see [MSP-Greg/github-actions-ruby-info](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/github-actions-ruby-info/actions) for information on current GitHub Actions Rubies.  Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.04, macOS, and windows-latest are shown.\r\n\r\n### Ruby 2.3.3\r\n\r\nRuby 2.3.3 was built with a proprietary version of MSYS.  Generally, an *.so file shouldn't be incompatible with other files built with different tools.\r\n\r\n### Why master?\r\n\r\nSince the Ruby versions may change (think Christmas), using master means that use in CI doesn't need to change versions every year...\r\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

You need to generate one in npm, then you can add it to your secrets (settings -> secrets) so that it can be passed to the action. DO NOT put the token directly in your workflow file.\n\n## Related projects\n\n- [npm-publish](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish) is a similar project\n- [version-check](https://github.com/EndBug/version-check) allows to define custom workflows based on version changes\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

This helps work around rate limit issues. Has no effect when `access-tokens` is also specified in `extra_nix_config`.\n\n- `install_url`: specify URL to install Nix from (useful for testing non-stable releases or pinning Nix, for example https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.3.7/install)\n\n- `install_options`: additional installer flags passed to the installer script.\n\n- `nix_path`: set `NIX_PATH` environment variable, for example `nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable`\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I print nixpkgs version I have configured?\n\n```yaml\n- name: Print nixpkgs version\n  run: nix-instantiate --eval -E \'(import <nixpkgs> {}).lib.version\'\n```\n\n### How do I run NixOS tests?\n\nWith the following inputs:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: cachix/install-nix-action@vXX\n  with:\n    extra_nix_config: ""system-features = nixos-test benchmark big-parallel kvm""\n```\n\n[Note that there\'s no hardware acceleration on GitHub Actions.](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/183#issuecomment-610723516).\n\n### How do I install packages via nix-env from the specified `nix_path`?\n\n```\nnix-env -i mypackage -f \'<nixpkgs>\'\n```\n\n### How do I add a binary cache?\n\nIf the binary cache you want to add is hosted on [Cachix](https://cachix.org/) and you are\nusing [cachix-action](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action), you\nshould use their `extraPullNames` input like this:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: cachix/cachix-action@vXX\n   with:\n     name: mycache\n     authToken: \'${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}\'\n     extraPullNames: nix-community\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can add any binary cache to nix.conf using\ninstall-nix-action\'s own `extra_nix_config` input:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v22\n  with:\n    extra_nix_config: |\n      trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=\n      substituters = https://hydra.iohk.io https://cache.nixos.org/\n```\n\n### How do I pass environment variables to commands run with `nix develop` or `nix shell`?\n\nNix runs commands in a restricted environment by default, called `pure mode`.\nIn pure mode, environment variables are not passed through to improve the reproducibility of the shell.\n\nYou can use the `--keep / -k` flag to keep certain environment variables:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Run a command with nix develop\n  run: nix develop --ignore-environment --keep MY_ENV_VAR --command echo $MY_ENV_VAR\n  env:\n    MY_ENV_VAR: ""hello world""\n```\n\nOr you can disable pure mode entirely with the `--impure` flag:\n\n```\nnix develop --impure\n```\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

404,"b'# Backport Bot\n\nBackport Bot is a [JavaScript GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) to backport a pull request by simply adding a label to it.\n\nIt can backport [rebased and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests with a single commit, [pull requests merged with a merge commit](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) as well as [squashed and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests. It thus integrates well with [Autosquash](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autosquash).\n\nThis version even works on forked repositories!\n\n## Usage\n\n1. :electric_plug: Add this [.github/workflows/backport.yml](.github/workflows/backport.yml) to your repository.\n2. :guardsman: Create a user for the bot. Set this username in backport.yml\n3. :scissors: With this user, fork your repository.\n4. :key: Generate a personal access token with this user. Give it only the ""public_repo"" permission.\n5. :unlock: Setup this personal access token as bot_token in backport.yml.\n6. :cloud: Obfuscate the personal access token by xor it with a randomly generated bot_token_key. This step is only to prevent Github from automatically revoking your token by placing it in a public repository.\n7. :speech_balloon: Let\'s say you want to backport a pull request on a branch named `production`. Then label it with `backport production`. (See [how to create labels](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-label/).)\n8. :sparkles: That\'s it! When the pull request gets merged, another pull request will be opened, backporting the commit to the `production` branch. If the pull request cannot be backported, a comment explaining why will automatically be posted.\n\n_Note:_ multiple backport labels can be added. For example, if a pull request has the labels `backport staging` and `backport production` it will be backported to both branches: `staging` and `production`.\n\n## Security Implications\n\nThe token provided to backport.yml will be visible to anyone with access to your repo.

Action, ensure security of your workflows. GitHub\nSecurity Lab provides more\n[detailed](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)\noverview of these risks involved in using `pull_request_target` and\n`workflow_run` triggers, as well as recommendations on how to avoid these risks.\n\nRecommended setup differs between public and private repositories, however the\nAction can be used in other combinations as well.\n\n### Public repositories\n\nUsing a `workflow_run` trigger allows to provide the Merge Me! Action with\nnecessary credentials, while allowing the CI to keep using `pull_request`\ntrigger, which is safer than `pull_request_target`.\n\nCreate a new `.github/workflows/merge-me.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\nname: Merge me!\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    types:\n      - completed\n    workflows:\n      # List all required workflow names here.\n      - 'Continuous Integration'\n\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    name: Merge me!\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - # It is often a desired behavior to merge only when a workflow execution\n        # succeeds.

This secret can have an arbitrary\n          # name, as an example, this repository uses `DOTTBOTT_TOKEN`.\n          #\n          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following\n          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:\n          #\n          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support pushing\n          # to protected branches.\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nTriggering on `check_suite` is similar:\n\n```yaml\nname: Merge me!\n\non:\n  check_suite:\n    types:\n      - completed\n\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    name: Merge me!\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Private repositories\n\nPrivate repositories are less prone attacks, as only a restricted set of\naccounts has access to them. At the same time, CIs in private repositories often\nrequire access to secrets for other purposes as well, such as installing private\ndependencies. For these reasons, it is recommended to use `pull_request_target`\ntrigger, which allows to combine regular CI checks and the Merge Me! Action into\none workflow:\n\n```yaml\nname: Continuous Integration\n\non:\n  # Trigger on Pull Requests against the master branch.\n  pull_request_target:\n    branches:\n      - master\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - synchronize\n  # Trigger on Pull Requests to the master branch.\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  # Add other CI jobs, such as testing and linting.

By default, this GitHub Action assumes the\nbot is [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot). You can override the bot\nname by changing the value of `GITHUB_LOGIN` parameter:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_LOGIN: my-awesome-bot-r2d2\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nA common scenario is to use Dependabot Preview (consider updating instead):\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_LOGIN: dependabot-preview\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n`GITHUB_LOGIN` option supports\n[micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\n\n### Opting in for using GitHub preview APIs\n\nYou may opt-in for using GitHub preview APIs, which enables the action to\nrespect strict branch protection rules configured for the repository\n(`Require status checks to pass before merging` and\n`Require branches to be up to date before merging` options).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          ENABLE_GITHUB_API_PREVIEW: true\n```\n\n### Use of configurable pull request merge method\n\nBy default, this GitHub Action assumes merge method is `SQUASH`. You can\noverride the merge method by changing the value of `MERGE_METHOD` parameter (one\nof `MERGE`, `SQUASH` or `REBASE`):\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          MERGE_METHOD: MERGE\n```\n\n### Presets\n\nPresets enable additional functionality which can be used to better personalize\ndefault behavior of the Merge me! Action.\n\nAvailable presets are:\n\n- `DEPENDABOT_MINOR` - Merge only minor and patch dependency updates for pull\n  requests created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows\n  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).\n- `DEPENDABOT_PATCH` - Merge only patch dependency updates for pull requests\n  created by Dependabot if the dependency version follows\n  [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          PRESET: DEPENDABOT_PATCH\n```\n\n### Number of retries\n\nIn case the merge action fails, by default it will automatically be retried up\nto three times using an exponential backoff strategy. This means, the first\nretry will happen 1 second after the first failure, while the second will happen\n4 seconds after the previous, the third 9 seconds, and so on.\n\nIt's possible to configure the number of retries by providing a value for\n`MAXIMUM_RETRIES` (by default, the value is `3`).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          MAXIMUM_RETRIES: 2\n```\n\n### Enable for manual changes\n\nThere are cases in which manual changes are needed, for instance, in order to\nmake the CI pass or to solve some conflicts that Dependabot (or the bot you are\nusing) cannot handle. By default, this GitHub action will skip this case where\nthe author is not [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot) (or the bot you\nare using). This is often desirable as the author might prefer to get a code\nreview before merging the changes. For this, it checks whether all commits were\nmade by the original author and that the commit signature is valid.\n\nIt is possible to override this default behavior by setting the value of\n`ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES` to `'true'`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  merge-me:\n    steps:\n      - name: Merge me!\n        uses: ridedott/merge-me-action@v2\n        with:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          ENABLED_FOR_MANUAL_CHANGES: 'true'\n```\n\n> Important: Please note the single quotes around `true`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your\nlocal machine for development and testing purposes. See usage notes on how to\nconsume this package in your project.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMinimal requirements to set up the project:\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v14, installation instructions can be found\n  on the official website, a recommended installation option is to use\n  [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme). It can be\n  installed in a\n  [few commands](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm).\n- A package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). All instructions in the\n  documentation will follow the npm syntax.\n- Optionally a [Git](https://git-scm.com) client.\n\n### Installing\n\nStart by cloning the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:ridedott/merge-me-action.git\n```\n\nIn case you don't have a git client, you can get the latest version directly by\nusing\n[this link](https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action/archive/master.zip) and\nextracting the downloaded archive.\n\nGo the the right directory and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd merge-me-action\nnpm install\n```\n\nThat's it! You can now go to the next step.\n\n## Testing\n\nAll tests are being executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). All tests files\nlive side-to-side with a source code and have a common suffix: `.spec.ts`. Some\nhelper methods are being stored in the `test` directory.\n\nThere are three helper scripts to run tests in the most common scenarios:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\nnpm run test:watch\nnpm run test:coverage\n```\n\n## Formatting\n\nThis project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automate formatting. All\nsupported files are being reformatted in a pre-commit hook. You can also use one\nof the two scripts to validate and optionally fix all of the files:\n\n```bash\nnpm run format\nnpm run format:fix\n```\n\n## Linting\n\nThis project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to enable static analysis.\nTypeScript files are linted using a [custom configuration](./.eslintrc).

Configures `PATH`, `LUA_PATH`, and `LUA_CPATH` environment variables to be able to use the `luarocks` command directly in workflows, and require installed modules in Lua.\n\n[`leafo/gh-actions-lua`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-lua-luajit) can be used to install Lua, which is required for LuaRocks to build and run. (This action will use any Lua installed in `.lua/`).\n\n## Usage\n\nInstalls Lua, LuaRocks, then install a module:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: leafo/gh-actions-lua@v9\n- uses: leafo/gh-actions-luarocks@v4\n\n# Install some package\n- name: install a module\n  run: luarocks install moonscript\n```\n\nFor a more complete example see: https://github.com/leafo/gh-actions-lua/blob/master/README.md#full-example\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `luarocksVersion`\n\n**Default**: `""3.8.0""`\n\nSpecifies which version of LuaRocks to install. Must be listed on https://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: leafo/gh-actions-luarocks@v4\n  with:\n    luarocksVersion: ""3.1.3""\n```\n\n### `withLuaPath`\n\n**Default**: `null` (Optional)\n\nManually specify the path to an existing Lua installation to use. This is not\nnecessary if you are using `leafo/gh-actions-lua`. Will build LuaRocks with\n`./configure --with-lua=$withLuaPath`\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: leafo/gh-actions-luarocks@v4\n  with:\n    withLuaPath: ""/usr/local/openresty/luajit/""\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The idea is to save number of jobs and free them for other queued runs. It is\nparticularly useful in case your projects development flow where contributors submit pull requests\nfrom forks. Using `workflow_run` trigger enables safe canceling of runs triggered by such pull requests.\n\nIn case your CI takes a lot of time and uses a lot of jobs, the action might help your project\nto reduce job usage and decrease waiting time as it detects and cancels runs that are still executed,\nbut we know already they are superseded by newer runs.\n\nThe main purpose of this action is canceling duplicated runs for the same branch as the current run,\neffectively limiting the resource consumption of the workflow to one run per branch. In short, the action\nis useful if you want to limit jobs usage on GitHub Actions in case of the usage pattern\nwhen fixups/rebases are pushed in quick succession to the same branch (fast iterations on a Pull Request).\nThis is achieved by `duplicates` cancel mode. The `duplicates` mode only cancels ""past"" runs - it does\nnot take into account runs that were started after the ""current"" run.\n\nAnother use case is to cancel the `pull_request` corresponding to the `workflow_run` triggered run.\nThis can happen when the triggered `workflow_run` finds that it makes no sense to proceed with\nthe source run. This is achieved by `self` cancel mode.\n\nThere are also two supplementary cancel modes for the action. Those supplementary use cases allow for further\noptimisations - failing fast in case we detect that important job failed and canceling duplicates of the\n`workflow_run` triggered events in case they execute some heavy jobs. This is achieved by `failedJobs` and\n`namedJobs` cancel modes.\n\nNote that `namedjobs` cancel mode is solely for the purpose of bypassing current limitations\nof GitHub Actions. Currently, there is no way to retrieve connection between triggering and triggered\nworkflow in case of `workflow_run`, as well as retrieving repository and branch of the triggering\nworkflow. The action uses workaround - it requires designing workflows in the way that they pass necessary\ninformation via carefully crafted job names. The job names are accessible via GitHub API, and they can be\nresolved during execution of the workflow using information about the linked workflow available\nat the workflow runtime. Hopefully this information will soon be available in GitHub Actions allowing\nremoval of `namedJobs` cancel mode and simplifying the examples and workflows using the Action.\n\nAnother feature of the Action is to notify the PRs linked to the workflows. Normally when workflows\nget cancelled there is no information why it happens, but this action can add an explanatory comment\nto the PR if the PR gets cancelled. This is controlled by `notifyPRCancel` boolean input.\n\nAlso, for the `workflow_run` events, GitHub does not yet provide an easy interface linking the original\nPull Request and the Workflow_run. You can ask the CancelWorkflowRun action to add extra comment to the PR\nadding explanatory message followed by a link to the `workflow_run` run.\n\nYou can take a look at the description provided in the\n[Apache Airflow\'s CI](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CI.rst) and\n[the workflows](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n\nStarted from simple cancel workflow developed by [n1hility](https://github.com/n1hility)\nthat implemented cancelling previous runs before introducing `workflow_run` type of event by\nGitHub Actions: [Cancel](https://github.com/n1hility/cancel-previous-runs).\n\n# Usage\n\nIf you want a comprehensive solution, you should use the action as follows:\n\n1) In case your project does not use public forks, it\'s enough to have one action with the `duplicates`\n   cancel mode in the workflow. This is a rare thing in open-source projects (usually those projects\n   accept pull requests from forks) and more often applicable for private repositories.\n\n2) If you use forks, you should create a separate ""Cancelling"" `workflow_run` triggered workflow.\n   The `workflow_run` should be responsible for all canceling actions. The examples below show\n   the possible ways the action can be utilized.\n\n3) If you have ""high queue strain"" situation - i.e. you often have many workflows queued due to limits\n   of teh GitHub Actions queue, you should consider using `allDuplicates` cancelling mode because otherwise,\n   the cancel itself might get queued until it is already too late to cancel the job. The `allDuplicates`\n   mode has been  designed to tackle this kind of situation where the ""canceling"" workflows are also queued,\n   in which case the cancel actions are far more aggressive in cancelling the workflow runs - including\n   the workflow runs that were started after the cancel action run. More about it in the\n   [Tackling the high queue strain situation](#tackling-the-high-queue-strain-situation)\n\n# The Action ""target"" workflow\n\nThe Action always acts on single ""target"" workflow. This means that it selects candidates to cancelling\n(depending on the cabcelling mode) from all workflow runs that belong to a particular workflow.\n\nThis ""workflow"" to act on can be chosen in several ways:\n\n1) By default, the action acts on workflow runs the action belongs to\n2) When you want to enable canceling for Pull Requests from forks, the action should be run in a\n   `workflow_run` type of event. In such case there are two workflows ""the source"" (for example pull_request) that\n   was the original one and ""the target workflow"" triggered by the source one (this is the workflow that\n   the cancel action should be part of). In such `workflow_run` type of event you should specify\n   ""${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}"" as `sourceRunId` - then the action will act on the ""source""\n   workflow instead of the default ""target"" one.\n3) You can explicitly specify the `workflowFileName` parameter to make the action works on specified workflow.\n\nAgain - the action always acts on a single workflow, so if you want to specify a single job that should cancel\nfew different workflows, you need to copy that step as many times you need and set different\n`workflowFileName` for every step. This is quite a bit repetitive, but this way you can see logs from\ncanceling operations from each workflow separately, and you can reason about it, at the same time having\nmultiple steps in the same jobs allows to optimize overhead of machine starting per job as those\nactions are usually very quick.\n\n```yaml\n  cancel-multiple-workflow-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel the self CI workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ""Cancel workflow 1""\n        uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        with:\n          cancelMode: allDuplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          workflowFileName: workflow_1.yml\n      - name: ""Cancel workflow 2""\n        uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        with:\n          cancelMode: allDuplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          workflowFileName: workflow_2.yml\n```\n\n# Inputs and outputs\n\n## Inputs\n\n| Input                    | Required | Default      | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `token`                  | yes      |              | The github token passed from `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `cancelMode`             | no       | `duplicates` | The mode to run cancel on.

It is resistant to temporary queues - as it can cancel also the future, queued\nworkflows that have duplicated, fresher (also queued workflows and this is recommended for everyone.\n\nThe below example is a ""workflow_run"" type of event. The workflow_run event always has ""write"" access that allows\nit to cancel other workflows - even if they are coming from pull request.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling Duplicates\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  cancel-duplicate-workflow-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: allDuplicates\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          sourceRunId: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}\n```\n\n\n# More Examples\n\nNote that you can combine the steps below in several steps of the same job. The examples here are showing\none step per case for clarity.\n\n## Repositories that use Pull Requests from forks\n\nNote that in case you implement separate ""Canceling workflow"", following the examples below, you do not\nneed to add cancel action to any other workflow. All Cancel actions should be configured in this\nCancelling workflow.\n\nThose examples show how you should configure your project with separate `Cancelling` workflow which is\ntriggered via `workflow_run` trigger.\n\nIn the example belows we use the following names:\n\n* **triggered workflow** - the ""Cancelling"" workflow - separate workflow triggered by the `workflow_run`\n  event. Its main job is to manage cancelling of other workflows.\n\n* **triggered run** - the run of the *triggered workflow*. It is triggered by another (""source"") run. In the\n  examples below, this run is in ""Cancelling"" workflow. It always runs in the context of the main repository,\n  even if it is triggered by a Pull Request from a fork.\n\n* **source workflow** - the ""main"" workflow - main workflow that performs CI actions. In the examples below,\n  this is a ""CI"" workflow.\n\n* **source run** - the run of the *source workflow*. It is the run that triggers the *triggered run*,\n  and it runs most of the CI tasks. In the examples below those are the runs of ""CI"" workflow.\n\n### Cancel duplicate runs for the source workflow\n\nCancel past, duplicate *source runs* of the *source workflow*. This workflow cancels\nduplicated, past runs (for the same branch/repo that those associated with the *source run* that triggered\nthe *triggered run*). You have to create it with the `sourceRunId` input with the value of\n`${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}` in order to work correctly.\n\nIn the example below, the `Canceling` run cancels past, duplicate runs from the `CI` with the same\nbranch/repo as the *source run* which triggered it - effectively what\'s left after the action is only\nthe latest *source run* of ""CI"" from the same branch/repo.\n\nThis works for all kind of triggering events (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` ...). It works for\nevents triggered in the local repository, as well as triggered from the forks, so you do not need\nto set up any extra actions to cancel internal Pushes/Pull Requests.\n\nYou can also choose to skip certain types of events (for example `push` and `schedule` if you want your\njobs to run to full completion for this kind of events.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  cancel-duplicate-workflow-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: duplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          sourceRunId: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n          skipEventTypes: \'[""push"", ""schedule""]\'\n```\n\nNote that `duplicate` cancel mode cannot be used for `workflow_run` type of event without `sourceId` input.\nThe action will throw an error in this case because it is not really doing what you would expect it to do.\nAll `workflow_run` events have the same branch and repository (they are all run in the context of the\ntarget branch and repository) no matter what is the source of the event, therefore cancelling duplicates\nwould cancel all the runs originated from all the branches and this is not really expected.\n\nIf you want to cancel duplicate runs of the *triggered workflow*, you need to utilize the\n`namedJob` cancel mode as described in the next chapter\n[Cancel duplicate jobs for triggered workflow](#cancel-duplicate-jobs-for-triggered-workflow) using outputs\nfrom the duplicate canceling for *source workflow* run above.\n\nHopefully we will have an easier way of doing that in the future once GitHub Actions API will allow\nsearching for source runs (it\'s not available at this moment).\n\n### Cancel duplicate jobs for triggered workflow\n\nCancels all past runs from the *triggered workflow* if any of the job names match any of the regular\nexpressions. Note that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all runs\nwith matching job names no mater the branch/repo.\n\nThis example is much more complex. It shows the actual case on how you can design your jobs using with\nusing outputs from the cancel duplicate action and running subsequent cancel with namedJobs cancel\nmode. Hopefully in the future better solution will come from Github Actions and such cancel flow will\nbe natively supported by GitHub Actions but as of now (August 2020) such native support is not\npossible. The example below uses specially named jobs that contain Branch, Repo and Run id of\nthe triggering run. The cancel operation finds the runs that have jobs with the names following\npattern containing the same repo and branch as the source run branch and repo in order to cancel duplicates.\n\nIn the case below, this workflow will first cancel the ""CI"" duplicate runs from the same branch and then\nit will cancel the runs from the Cancelling workflow which contain the same repo and branch as\nin job names, effectively implementing cancelling duplicate runs for the Cancelling workflow.\n\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  cancel-duplicate-ci-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel duplicate CI runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      sourceHeadRepo: ${{ steps.cancel.outputs.sourceHeadRepo }}\n      sourceHeadBranch: ${{ steps.cancel.outputs.sourceHeadBranch }}\n      sourceHeadSha: ${{ steps.cancel.outputs.sourceHeadSha }}\n      sourceEvent: ${{ steps.cancel.outputs.sourceEvent }}\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        id: cancel\n        name: ""Cancel duplicate CI runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: duplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n          notifyPRMessageStart: |\n            Note!

The difference vs. previous case is that\nyou do not specify the `sourceRunId` input.\n\nIn the case below - self workflow will be cancelled.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\n  cancel-self-cancelling-run:\n    name: ""Cancel the self Canceling workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ""Cancel the self Cancelling workflow run""\n        uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        with:\n          cancelMode: self\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n```\n\nNote that if you want to cancel both - source workflow and self workflow you need to first cancel\nthe source workflow, and then cancel the self one, not the other way round :).\n\n### Fail-fast source workflow runs with failed jobs\n\nCancels all runs from the *source workflow* if there are failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions.\nNote that the action does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs\nwith failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.\n\nIn the case below, if any of `CI` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs\nnames matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they\nwill be cancelled.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  fail-fast-triggered-workflow-named-jobs-runs:\n    name: ""Fail fast CI runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Fail fast CI runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: failedJobs\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          sourceRunId: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n          jobNameRegexps: \'[""^Static checks$"", ""^Build docs$"", ""^Build prod image.*""]\'\n```\n\nNote that if you not only want to cancel the failed triggering workflows but also\nthe want to fail the corresponding ""Cancelling"" workflows, you need to implement the solution\ndescribed in the next chapter.\n\n### Fail-fast source workflow runs with failed jobs and corresponding triggered runs\n\nCancels all runs from the *source workflow* if there are failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions,\nalso cancels the corresponding *triggered runs*.\nNote that the action does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs\nwith failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.\n\nIn the case below, if any of `CI` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs\nnames matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they\nwill be cancelled as well as the corresponding ""Cancelling"" workflow runs.\n\nThere is no native support yet in GitHub actions to do it easily, so the example below shows how this can be\nachieved using `namedJobs` and output returned from the previous `Cancel Workflow Runs` action. Hopefull\nthis will be simplified when GitHub Actions introduce native support for it.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  fail-fast-triggered-workflow-named-jobs-runs:\n    name: ""Fail fast CI runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Fail fast CI.

Note that it does not take into account the branch/repos of the runs. It will cancel all runs\nwith failed jobs no mater the branch/repo.\n\nIn the case below, if any of `Cancelling` workflow runs (even with different branch heads) have failed jobs\nnames matching `^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp - they\nwill be cancelled.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  fail-fast-triggered-workflow-named-jobs-runs:\n    name: ""Fail fast Canceling runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Fail fast Canceling runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: failedJobs\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          jobNameRegexps: \'[""^Static checks$"", ""^Build docs$"", ""^Build prod image.*""]\'\n```\n\n### Cancel another workflow run\n\nThis is useful in case you decide to cancel the *source run* that triggered the *triggered run*.\nIn the case below, the step cancels the `CI` workflow that triggered the `Cancelling` run.\n\n```yaml\nname: Cancelling\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\n  cancel-other-workflow-run:\n    name: ""Cancel the self CI workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ""Cancel the self CI workflow run""\n        uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        with:\n          cancelMode: duplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          workflowFileName: other_workflow.yml\n```\n\n### Cancel all duplicates for named jobs\n\nCancels all duplicated runs for all jobs that match specified regular expression.\nNote that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all duplicates with\nthe same match for jobs, no matter what branch originated it.\n\nThis is useful in case of job names generated dynamically.\n\nIn the case below, for all the runs that have job names generated containing Branch/Repo/Event combination\nthat have the same match, the duplicates will get cancelled leaving only the most recent run for each exact\nmatch.\n\nNote that the match must be identical. If there are two jobs that have a different Branch\nthey will both match the same pattern, but they are not considered duplicates.\n\nAlso, this is one of the jobs It has also self-preservation turned off.\nThis means that in case the job determines that it is itself a duplicate it will cancel itself. That\'s\nwhy checking for duplicates of self-workflow should be the last step in the cancelling process.\n\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  cancel-self-failed-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel the self workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel past CI runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: allDuplicatedNamedJobs\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          jobNameRegexps: \'[""Branch: .* Repo: .* Event: .* ""]\'\n          selfPreservation: false\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Repositories that do not use Pull Requests from forks\n\nNote that examples in this chapter only work if you do not have Pull Requests coming from forks (so for\nexample if you only work in a private repository). When those action runs within the usual `pull_request`\ntriggered runs coming from a fork, they have not enough permissions to cancel running workflows.\n\nIf you want to cancel `pull_requests` from forks, you need to use `workflow_run` triggered runs - see the\n[Repositories that use Pull Requests from fork](#repositories-that-use-pull-requests-from-forks) chapter.\n\nNote that in case you configure the separate `workflow_run` Cancelling workflow, there is no need to add\nthe action to the ""source"" workflows. The ""Canceling workflow"" pattern handles well not only Pull Requests\nfrom the forks, but also all other cases - including cancelling Pull Requests for the same repository\nand canceling scheduled runs.\n\n### Cancel duplicate runs for ""self"" workflow\n\nCancels past runs for the same workflow (with the same branch).\n\nIn the case below, any of the direct ""push"" events will cancel all past runs for the same branch as the\none being pushed. However, it can be configured for ""pull_request"" (in the same repository) or ""schedule""\ntype of events as well. It will also notify the PR with the comment containining why it has been\ncancelled.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: push\njobs:\n  cancel-duplicate-workflow-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel duplicate workflow runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: duplicates\n          cancelFutureDuplicates: true\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n```\n\n### Cancel ""self"" workflow run\n\nThis is useful in case you decide to cancel ""self"" run.\n\nIn the case below - own workflow will be cancelled immediately. It can be configured for ""push"",\n""pull_request"" (from the same repository) or ""schedule"" type of events.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: push\njobs:\n  cancel-self-run:\n    name: ""Cancel the self workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: ""Cancel the self workflow run""\n        uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        with:\n          cancelMode: self\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n```\n\n### Fail-fast workflow runs with failed jobs\n\nCancels all runs (including self run!) if they have failed jobs matching any of the regular expressions.\nNote that it does not take into account the branch of the running jobs. It will cancel all runs with failed\njobs, no matter what branch originated it.\n\nIn the case below, if any of the own workflow runs have failed jobs matching any of the\n`^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp, this workflow will cancel the runs.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non:\n  push:\n\njobs:\n  cancel-self-failed-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel failed runs""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel failed runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: failedJobs\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          jobNameRegexps: \'[""^Static checks$"", ""^Build docs$"", ""^Build prod image.*""]\'\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n```\n\n### Cancel all runs with named jobs\n\nCancels all runs (including self run!) if any of the job names match any of the regular\nexpressions. Note that it does not take into account the branch of the runs. It will cancel all runs with\nmatching jobs, no matter what branch originated it.\n\nThis is useful in case of job names generated dynamically.\n\nIn the case below, if any of the ""self"" workflow runs has job names that matches any of the\n`^Static checks$` and `^Build docs^` or `^Build prod image .*` regexp, this workflow will cancel the runs.\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'CI\']\n    types: [\'requested\']\n\njobs:\n  cancel-self-failed-runs:\n    name: ""Cancel the self workflow run""\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs@master\n        name: ""Cancel past CI runs""\n        with:\n          cancelMode: namedJobs\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          jobNameRegexps: \'[""^Static checks$"", ""^Build docs$"", ""^Build prod image.*""]\'\n          notifyPRCancel: true\n```\n\n## Tackling the high queue strain situation\n\nSometimes your project is in a situation where you have high strain on the queue in GitHub Actions.\nAll GitHub Actions queues are limited and when you have many, long-running workflows triggered by\nmany PRs, you can get in the situation, where the ""cancel"" workflows are queued themselves. This is where\n`allDuplicates` mode of cancellation becomes handy,\n\n\nImagine, You have a number of people submitting `PR1`, `PR2` from their forks, and a committer pushing branch\n`branch-A` directly to your repository.  Imagine that some of those people pushed several commits in\nquick succession  for all of those.\n\nThis usually happen when you realized that there is one more change needed or when you\niteratively work on your PR. Usually it is either a `--force-push` commit replacing the previous ones\nor ""--fixup commit"". It works the same in both cases but this is a ""natural"" way people work.\nFor example for many people it is far easier to review whole extent of your change in GitHub\n(they are used to doing PR reviews there). They push the change as PR, review it there themselves\nand realize they need one more line to be removed (and they add --fixup and push again).\n\nComing back to my example. Imagine you have high strain situation. All your PRs generated 10 or so\nworkflows (that\'s how Pulsar works - produces many workflows per PR). But let\'s assume we have two\n""real"" workflows ""w1"" and ""w2"" and the ""cancel"" workflow I added ""c"". So, initially all of the workflows\ngenerated are in ""Pending"" state. assume each of the PRs has been pushed twice -\nfirst `Commit 1` (C1) and then fixup `Commit 2` (C2). So all C1s are ""older"" duplicates of C2 that\nshould be cancelled as soon as possible (we know newer version is coming).\n\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n\nThen imagine that PR1 ""standard"" worflows started to run for C1. So they change state to \'running\'\n\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | running | running | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n\nSo far so good. Then the ""cancel workflow""  starts running for C1 commit in PR1.\n\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | running | running | running | pending | pending | pending |\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n\nThe ""cancel"" workflow with `allDuplicates` mode is ""aggressive"". It will look for ANY duplicates in\nANY PRs/Branches (including the Pending ones) and cancels them. So what happens next it will set all\nC1 runs to cancelled state (no matter if they were Pending or running):\n\n\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | cancelling | cancelling | complete | pending | pending | pending |\n| PR2      | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n| branch-A | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |\n\nThose runs will be quickly canceled and job slots from the ""Running"" ones will be freed for next runs so\nlikely, some of the Pending C2 runs from PR1 will be quickly ""Running:\n\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\n|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | complete | running | running | pending |\n| PR2      | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\n| branch-A | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\n\nNow - the ""cancel"" workflows are not cancelled themselves. They will continue running, but they are\nquick usually and any ""cancel workflow"" run next will see there are no duplicates and will complete\nquickly leaving the ""slot"" for ""real"" workflows of the latest commits (C2) to run - hopefully more\nslots are available then, and your C2 workflows start running after that:\n\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |\n| PR2      | complete | running  | running  | pending  |\n| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  |\n\nHower if the committer again pushes THIRD commit C3 to branch-A in the meantime, the (so far pending)\ncancel workflows will again prove to be useful. Let\'s say PR2\'s ""cancel workflow"" for C2 runs after\nthe new commit has been added by the commiyter:\n\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\n| PR2      | complete | complete | running  | running  |         |         |         |\n| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\n\nThe PR2\'s c-C2 workflow (or even branch-As, c-C1 workflow if the PR2\'s one managed to run already)\nwill find that there is a duplicate in `branch-A` and it will cancel those:\n\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\n| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |\n| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | running  | running | running | pending |\n\nAgain the remaining ""cancel"" workflow (branch A\'s c-C2 an c-C3) complete quickly and do nothing as\nthere are no duplicates, freeing the slot for ""regular"" workflows:\n\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\n| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |\n| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | complete  | running | running | complete |\n\nEffectively what we get is that the ""duplicates"" will be cancelled frequently enough (as often as\nANY ""cancel"" workflow from  ANY commit from ANY branch manages to get into ""running"" state)\n\n\n## Development environment\n\nIt is highly recommended tu use [pre commit](https://pre-commit.com).

A potential solution is: Create a new branch with the actions file and make it the default branch.\n\n## Advanced Usage: Sync all branches\n1. Make a backup\n2. Create a new branch in your repo (destination repo), it should not share the name with any branch in source repo\n3. Make the new branch the default branch under repo settings\n4. Use `*` for both `source_branch` and `destination_branch`\n5. Optionally, you can force sync all tags:\n   ```\n   with:\n     sync_tags: ""true""\n   ```\nThis will force sync ALL branches to match source repo. Branches that are created only in the destination repo will not be affected but all the other branches will be *hard reset* to match source repo. \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This does mean if upstream ever creates a branch that shares the name, your changes will be gone.\n\n## Contributors \xe2\x9c\xa8\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""https://whe.me""><img src=""https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5880908?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>Wei He</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=wei"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a> <a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=wei"" title=""Documentation"">\xf0\x9f\x93\x96</a> <a href=""#design-wei"" title=""Design"">\xf0\x9f\x8e\xa8</a> <a href=""#ideas-wei"" title=""Ideas, Planning, & Feedback"">\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94</a></td>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""http://zeke.sikelianos.com""><img src=""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2289?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>Zeke Sikelianos</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=zeke"" title=""Documentation"">\xf0\x9f\x93\x96</a> <a href=""#ideas-zeke"" title=""Ideas, Planning, & Feedback"">\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94</a></td>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""https://alexpage.com.au""><img src=""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19199063?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>Alex Page</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/issues?q=author%3Aalex-page"" title=""Bug reports"">\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b</a></td>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""https://github.com/xtqqczze""><img src=""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/45661989?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>xtqqczze</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=xtqqczze"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a> <a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=xtqqczze"" title=""Documentation"">\xf0\x9f\x93\x96</a></td>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""https://unstoppable.software""><img src=""https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/70325615?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>Kay Harrison-Sims</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/issues?q=author%3AGlitchShtick"" title=""Bug reports"">\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b</a></td>\n    <td align=""center""><a href=""https://github.com/Gibby""><img src=""https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/503761?v=4"" width=""100px;"" alt=""""/><br /><sub><b>Gibby</b></sub></a><br /><a href=""https://github.com/repo-sync/github-sync/commits?author=Gibby"" title=""Code"">\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

If you want to run checks against multiple paths in your repository, you can use this Action in a [matrix run](#multiple-paths).\n\n## Major versions supported\n* 3: `clang-format-3.9`\n* 4: `clang-format-4.0`\n* 5: `clang-format-5.0`\n* 6: `clang-format-6.0`\n* 7: `clang-format-7`\n* 8: `clang-format-8`\n* 9: `clang-format-9`\n* 10: `clang-format-10`\n* 11:  `clang-format-11`\n* 12: `clang-format-12`\n* 13: `clang-format-13`\n* 14: `clang-format-14`\n* 15: `clang-format-15`\n* 16: `clang-format-16`\n\n## Do you find this useful?\n\nYou can sponsor me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/jidicula)!\n\n## Inputs\n* `clang-format-version` [optional]: The major version of `clang-format` that you want to run on your codebase.\n  * Default: `13`\n  * Available versions: see [Versions supported](#versions-supported)\n* `check-path` [optional]: The path to the directory in the repo that should be checked for C/C++/Protobuf formatting.\n  * Default: `.`\n  * For cleaner output (i.e. with no double-slashed paths), the final directory in this path should have no trailing slash, e.g. `src` and not `src/`.\n* `fallback-style` [optional]: The fallback style for `clang-format` if no `.clang-format` file exists in your repository.\n  * Default: `llvm`\n  * Available values: `LLVM`, `Google`, `Chromium`, `Mozilla`, `WebKit` and others listed in the `clang-format` [docs for BasedOnStyle](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html#configurable-format-style-options).\n* `exclude-regex` [optional]: A regex to exclude files or directories that should not be checked.\n  * Default: `^$`\n  * Pattern matching is done with a POSIX `grep -E` extended regex, **not** a glob expression. You can exclude multiple patterns like this: `(hello|world)`. Build and verify your regex at https://regex101.com .\n* `include-regex` [optional]: A regex to include files or directories that should be checked.\n  * Default: `^.*\\.((((c|C)(c|pp|xx|\\+\\+)?$)|((h|H)h?(pp|xx|\\+\\+)?$))|(ino|pde|proto|cu))$`\n  * Pattern matching is done with a POSIX `grep -E` extended regex, **not** a glob expression. You can exclude multiple patterns like this: `(hello|world)`. Build and verify your regex at https://regex101.com .\n\nThis action checks all C/C++/Protobuf (including Arduino `.ino` and `.pde`) files in the provided directory in the GitHub workspace are formatted correctly using `clang-format`. If no directory is provided or the provided path is not a directory in the GitHub workspace, all C/C++/Protobuf files are checked.\n\nThe following file extensions are checked by default:\n* Header files:\n  * `.h`\n  * `.H`\n  * `.hpp`\n  * `.hh`\n  * `.h++`\n  * `.hxx `\n* Source files:\n  * `.c`\n  * `.C`\n  * `.cpp`\n  * `.cc`\n  * `.c++`\n  * `.cxx`\n  * `.ino`\n  * `.pde`\n  * `.cu`\n* Protobuf files:\n  * `.proto`\n\n## Returns:\n\n* SUCCESS: zero exit-code if C/C++/Protobuf files in `check-path` are formatted correctly\n* FAILURE: nonzero exit-code if C/C++/Protobuf files in `check-path` are not formatted correctly\n\n# Usage\n\n\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8fThis action does not run on `windows` GitHub Actions runners!\n\n## Single Path\n\nTo use this action, create a `.github/workflows/clang-format-check.yml` in your repository containing:\n\n```yaml\nname: clang-format Check\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  formatting-check:\n    name: Formatting Check\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Run clang-format style check for C/C++/Protobuf programs.\n      uses: jidicula/clang-format-action@v4.11.0\n      with:\n        clang-format-version: \'13\'\n        check-path: \'src\'\n        fallback-style: \'Mozilla\' # optional\n```\n\n## Multiple Paths\nTo use this action on multiple paths in parallel, create a `.github/workflows/clang-format-check.yml` in your repository containing:\n\n```yaml\nname: clang-format Check\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  formatting-check:\n    name: Formatting Check\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        path:\n          - \'src\'\n          - \'examples\'\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Run clang-format style check for C/C++/Protobuf programs.\n      uses: jidicula/clang-format-action@v4.11.0\n      with:\n        clang-format-version: \'13\'\n        check-path: ${{ matrix.path }}\n        fallback-style: \'Mozilla\' # optional\n```\n\n## Multiple Paths with Exclusion Regexes\nTo use this action on multiple paths in parallel with exclusions, create a `.github/workflows/clang-format-check.yml` in your repository containing:\n\n```yaml\nname: clang-format Check\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  formatting-check:\n    name: Formatting Check\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        path:\n          - check: \'src\'\n            exclude: \'(hello|world)\' # Exclude file paths containing ""hello"" or ""world""\n          - check: \'examples\'\n            exclude: \'\'              # Nothing to exclude\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Run clang-format style check for C/C++/Protobuf programs.\n      uses: jidicula/clang-format-action@v4.11.0\n      with:\n        clang-format-version: \'13\'\n        check-path: ${{ matrix.path[\'check\'] }}\n        exclude-regex: ${{ matrix.path[\'exclude\'] }}\n        fallback-style: \'Mozilla\' # optional\n```\n\n# Who uses this?\n\n[These public repos](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=uses%3A+jidicula%2Fclang-format-action+-user%3Ajidicula&s=indexed&type=Code) use this Action.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

422,"b'# action-tribe-phpcs\n\nModern Tribe\'s PHPCS Code Review - GitHub Action\n\n## Dockerfile\n\nThe container in use is currently on Docker Hub as `borkweb/tribe-phpcs`. The Dockerfile for that image is defined in our [packages repo](https://github.com/moderntribe/packages).\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you would like to add automated code sniffing to PRs on a new repository, there are a few things that must be set up first.\n\n### Add PHPCS to `composer.json`\n\nFor PHPCS to function appropriately, it needs to be included in the repository via composer.\n\n**Within `require-dev`, add the following:**\n\n```\n""require-dev"": {\n    ""dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer"": ""^0.4.4"",\n    ""wp-coding-standards/wpcs"": ""^2.1"",\n    ""automattic/vipwpcs"": ""^2.0"",\n    ""moderntribe/tribalscents"": ""dev-master"",\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Within `repositories`, add the following:**\n\n```\n""repositories"": [\n    {\n      ""name"": ""moderntribe/TribalScents"",\n      ""type"": ""github"",\n      ""url"": ""https://github.com/moderntribe/TribalScents"",\n      ""no-api"": true\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Create `phpcs.xml`\n\nYou\'ll need a `phpcs.xml` file to declare the rulesets the repository will be using. Here\'s an example of one that we use for our plugins:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=""1.0""?>\n<ruleset name=""Modern Tribe Plugin Coding Standards"">\n\t<rule ref=""TribalScents""></rule>\n\t<rule ref=""WordPress-VIP-Go""></rule>\n\t<rule ref=""WordPress"">\n\t\t<exclude name=""WordPress.Files.FileName""/>\n\t</rule>\n\t<rule ref=""WordPress-Extra""></rule>\n\t<rule ref=""WordPress-Docs""></rule>\n\t<rule ref=""WordPress-Core""></rule>\n</ruleset>\n```\n\n### Adding a GitHub Workflow\n\nYou will need a GitHub Workflow to make this magic happen. You can [read about it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow) in the GitHub docs. You could also just copy the `.github/workflows` directory from [The Events Calendar](https://github.com/moderntribe/the-events-calendar).\n\n#### Inputs\n\n##### `github-bot-token`\n\nYou will need to declare a secret of `GH_BOT_TOKEN` in your repo\'s Settings > Secrets. The token should be a Personal Access Token (preferably for a bot account) where that bot has access to the relevant repos in the Modern Tribe organization. The Token for tr1b0t is labeled as `tr1b0t GitHub OAuth Token` in our company 1Password vault.\n\n#### Example usage\n\n```\n- uses: moderntribe/action-tribe-phpcs@master\n  with:\n    github_bot_token: ${{ secrets.GH_BOT_TOKEN }}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The problem I\nfound with this is when I was in projects where I had subsequent steps/actions in which I wanted to\nknow whether a new version was cut.\n\n> **Use Case:** For instance, in an application where I\'m using `semantic-release` to manage GitHub\n> releases, but also building and pushing docker images. Dockerhub has a\n> [nice GitHub integration](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) to handle this for us, but\n> some other registries do not. If I need to cut a new release, then update a docker registry by\n> adding a new tagged build, I\'ll want to run `semantic-release` and then build a docker image, tag\n> it with a version and push it up. In my case I like to push up tags for `latest`, the semver (i.e.\n> `v1.8.3`), and just the major the version (i.e. `v1`).\n\nI want to know 1) if semantic-release cut a new version and 2) what the version is.\n\nThere\'s a number of ways to handle this, but the most elegant way I found to do it was to abstract\nit into it\'s own custom action. It abstracts away whatever logic you need to figure out what that\nnew release number is.\n\nThis also scales well, just in case I want to add some flexibility and functionality to this action,\nI can easily leverage it across any project.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can pass in `semantic-release` configuration options via GitHub Action inputs using `with`.\n\nIt\'s important to note, **NONE** of these inputs are required. Semantic release has a default\nconfiguration that it will use if you don\'t provide any.\n\nAlso of note, if you\'d like to override the default configuration and you\'d rather not use the\ninputs here, the action will automatically use any\n[`semantic-release` configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration-file)\ndefined in your repo (`.releaserc`, `release.config.js`, `release` prop in `package.json`)\n\n> **Note**: Each input **will take precedence** over options configured in the configuration file\n> and shareable configurations.\n\n| Input Variable      | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| branches            | `Array`, `String`, `Object` | The branches on which releases should happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| plugins             | `Array`                     | Define the list of plugins to use.

431,"b'# GitHub Automatic Releases\n\nThis action simplifies the GitHub release process by automatically uploading assets, generating changelogs, handling pre-releases, and so on.\n\n## Contents\n\n1. [Usage Examples](#usage-examples)\n1. [Supported Parameters](#supported-parameters)\n1. [Event Triggers](#event-triggers)\n1. [Versioning](#versioning)\n1. [How to get help](#how-to-get-help)\n1. [License](#license)\n\n> **NOTE**: The `marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases` repository is an automatically generated mirror of the [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions) monorepo containing this and other actions. Please file issues and pull requests over there.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Automatically generate a pre-release when changes land on master\n\nThis example workflow will kick in as soon as changes land on `master`. After running the steps to build and test your project:\n\n1. It will create (or replace) a git tag called `latest`.\n1. Generate a changelog from all the commits between this, and the previous `latest` tag.\n1. Generate a new release associated with the `latest` tag (removing any previous associated releases).\n1. Update this new release with the specified title (e.g. `Development Build`).\n1. Upload `LICENSE.txt` and any `jar` files as release assets.\n1. Mark this release as a `pre-release`.\n\nYou can see a working example of this workflow over at [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/releases/tag/latest).\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: ""pre-release""\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - ""master""\n\njobs:\n  pre-release:\n    name: ""Pre Release""\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n\n    steps:\n      # ...\n      - name: ""Build & test""\n        run: |\n          echo ""done!""\n\n      - uses: ""marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases@latest""\n        with:\n          repo_token: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n          automatic_release_tag: ""latest""\n          prerelease: true\n          title: ""Development Build""\n          files: |\n            LICENSE.txt\n            *.jar\n```\n\n### Create a new GitHub release when tags are pushed to the repository\n\nSimilar to the previous example, this workflow will kick in as soon as new tags are pushed to GitHub. After building & testing your project:\n\n1. Generate a changelog from all the commits between this and the previous [semver-looking](https://semver.org/) tag.\n1. Generate a new release and associate it with this tag.\n1. Upload `LICENSE.txt` and any `jar` files as release assets.\n\nOnce again there\'s an example of this over at [marvinpinto/actions](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/releases/latest).\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: ""tagged-release""\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - ""v*""\n\njobs:\n  tagged-release:\n    name: ""Tagged Release""\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n\n    steps:\n      # ...\n      - name: ""Build & test""\n        run: |\n          echo ""done!""\n\n      - uses: ""marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases@latest""\n        with:\n          repo_token: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n          prerelease: false\n          files: |\n            LICENSE.txt\n            *.jar\n```\n\n## Supported Parameters\n\n| Parameter               | Description                                                | Default  |\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| `repo_token`\\*\\*        | GitHub Action token, e.g. `""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""`. | `null`   |\n| `draft`                 | Mark this release as a draft?                              | `false`  |\n| `prerelease`            | Mark this release as a pre-release?                        | `true`   |\n| `automatic_release_tag` | Tag name to use for automatic releases, e.g `latest`.      | `null`   |\n| `title`                 | Release title; defaults to the tag name if none specified. | Tag Name |\n| `files`                 | Files to upload as part of the release assets.             | `null`   |\n\n## Outputs\n\nThe following output values can be accessed via `${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.<output-name> }}`:\n\n| Name                     | Description                                            | Type   |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |\n| `automatic_releases_tag` | The release tag this action just processed             | string |\n| `upload_url`             | The URL for uploading additional assets to the release | string |\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Parameters denoted with `**` are required.\n- The `files` parameter supports multi-line [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) patterns, see repository examples.\n\n## Event Triggers\n\nThe GitHub Actions framework allows you to trigger this (and other) actions on _many combinations_ of events. For example, you could create specific pre-releases for release candidate tags (e.g `*-rc*`), generate releases as changes land on master (example above), nightly releases, and much more. Read through [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for ideas and advanced examples.\n\n## Versioning\n\nEvery commit that lands on master for this project triggers an automatic build as well as a tagged release called `latest`. If you don\'t wish to live on the bleeding edge you may use a stable release instead. See [releases](../../releases/latest) for the available versions.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: ""marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases@<VERSION>""\n```\n\n## How to get help\n\nThe main [README](https://github.com/marvinpinto/actions/blob/master/README.md) for this project has a bunch of information related to debugging & submitting issues. If you\'re still stuck, try and get a hold of me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/marvinpinto) and I will do my best to help you out.\n\n## License\n\nThe source code for this project is released under the [MIT License](/LICENSE).

The `circleci-jobs` (below) should be labeled correspondingly.\n- The `api-token` needs to be a\n  *[CircleCI personal API token](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens)*\n  (not a *project token* as it is not supported yet in API v2!) whose value\n  has been added to the GitHub secrets of your repository (e.g., as \n  `CIRCLE_TOKEN`), e.g. for the MNE-Python *project* this would be\n  https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/settings/secrets/actions and for the\n  *organization* it would be https://github.com/organizations/mne-tools/settings/secrets/actions (pick whichever scope makes sense for you).\n- The `artifact-path` should point to an artifact path from your CircleCI\n  build. This is typically whatever follows the CircleCI artifact root path,\n  for example `0/test_artifacts/root_artifact.md`.\n- The `circleci-jobs` is a comma-separated list of jobs to monitor, but usually\n  there is a single one that you want an artifact path for.\n  The default is `""build_docs,build,doc""`, which will look for any\n  jobs with these names and create an artifacts link for them. If you have\n  multiple jobs to consider, make sure you adjust your `if:` statement (above)\n  correspondingly.\n- The `job-title` corresponds to the name of the action job as it will appear\n  on github. It is **not** the circle-ci job you want the artifacts for\n  (this is `circleci-jobs`). This field is optional.\n- The action has an outtput ``url`` that you can use in downstream steps, but\n  this URL will only point to a valid artifact once the job is complete, i.e.,\n  `github.event.status` is either `\'success\'`, `\'fail\'`, or (maybe) `\'error\'`,\n  not `\'pending\'`.\n- If you have trouble, try [enabling debugging logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)\n  for the action by setting the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true`.\n\n> **Note**: The standard PR-to-main-repo-from-branch-in-a-fork workflow might\n> not activate the action.

The `template` file can be a local file existing in the working directory, or a URL to template that exists in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket. It will create the Stack if it does not exist, or create a [Change Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html) to update the Stack. An update fails by default when the Change Set is empty. Setting `no-fail-on-empty-changeset: ""1""` will override this behavior and not throw an error.\n\n### Inputs\n\nA few inputs are highlighted below. See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs and outputs.\n\n#### parameter-overrides (OPTIONAL)\n\nTo override parameter values in the template you can provide a string or a file that is either local or an URL.\n\nOverride multiple parameters separated by commas: `""MyParam1=myValue1,MyParam2=myValue2""`\n\nOverride a comma delimited list: `""MyParam1=myValue1,MyParam1=myValue2""` or `MyParam1=""myValue1,myValue2""`\n\nOverride parameters using a local JSON file: `""file:///${{ github.workspace }}/parameters.json""` with a file named `parameters.json` at the root of the repository:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    ""ParameterKey"": ""MyParam1"",\n    ""ParameterValue"": ""myValue1""\n  }\n]\n```\n\n> You can learn more about [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\n\n## Credentials and Region\n\nThis action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.\nUse [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.\n\nWe recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:\n\n- Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code. You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.\n- [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository. Do not use the AWS account root user access key.\n- [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows. Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows. See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.\n- [Rotate the credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) used in GitHub Actions workflows regularly.\n- [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n## Permissions\n\nThis action requires the following minimum set of permissions:\n\n> We recommend to read [AWS CloudFormation Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)\n\n```\n{\n    ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n    ""Statement"": [\n        {\n            ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n            ""Action"": [\n                ""cloudformation:CreateStack"",\n                ""cloudformation:DescribeStacks"",\n                ""cloudformation:CreateChangeSet"",\n                ""cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet"",\n                ""cloudformation:DeleteChangeSet"",\n                ""cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet""\n            ],\n            ""Resource"": ""*""\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n> The policy above prevents the stack to be deleted by a policy for production\n\n## Example\n\nYou want to run your microservices with [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and leverage the best-practices to run the cluster? Using this GitHub Action you can customize and deploy the [modular and scalable Amazon EKS architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/) provided in an AWS Quick Start to your AWS Account. The following workflow enables you to create and update a Kubernetes cluster using a manual workflow trigger.\n\nYou only have to create an [Amazon EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) to run this workflow.\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy Cluster\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      region:\n        description: \'AWS Region\'\n        required: true\n        default: \'eu-west-1\'\n      keypair:\n        description: \'SSH Key Pair\'\n        required: true\n\njobs:\n  cluster:\n    name: Deploy stack to AWS\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      env-name: ${{ steps.env-name.outputs.environment }}\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Configure AWS credentials\n      id: creds\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n      with:\n        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n        aws-region: ${{ github.event.inputs.region}}\n\n    - name: Configure environment name\n      id: env-name\n      env:\n        REPO: ${{ github.repository }}\n      run: |\n        ENVIRONMENT=`echo $REPO | tr ""/"" ""-""`\n        echo ""Environment name: $ENVIRONMENT""\n        echo ""environment=$ENVIRONMENT"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n    - name: Deploy Amazon EKS Cluster\n      id: eks-cluster\n      uses: aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy@master\n      with:\n        name: ${{ steps.env-name.outputs.environment }}-cluster\n        template: https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-amazon-eks/templates/amazon-eks-master.template.yaml\n        no-fail-on-empty-changeset: ""1""\n        parameter-overrides: >-\n          AvailabilityZones=${{ github.event.inputs.region }}a,\n          AvailabilityZones=${{ github.event.inputs.region }}c,\n          KeyPairName=${{ github.event.inputs.keypair }},\n          NumberOfAZs=2,\n          ProvisionBastionHost=Disabled,\n          EKSPublicAccessEndpoint=Enabled,\n          EKSPrivateAccessEndpoint=Enabled,\n          RemoteAccessCIDR=0.0.0.0/0\n\n```\n\n### Proxy Configuration\n\nIf you run in self-hosted environments and in secured environment where you need use a specific proxy you can set it in the action manually.\n\nAdditionally this action will always consider already configured proxy in the environment.\n\nManually configured proxy:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy@v1\nwith:\n  name: eks-primary\n  template: https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-amazon-eks/templates/amazon-eks-master.template.yaml\n  no-fail-on-empty-changeset: ""1""\n  http-proxy: ""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n```\n\nProxy configured in the environment variable:\n\n```bash\n# Your environment configuration\nHTTP_PROXY=""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n```\n\nThe action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment and you don\'t need to configure it in the action.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](/LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

(This can be optionally skipped if subsequent steps in the same job do not need to access the results of Terraform commands.)\n\nAfter you\'ve used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Terraform commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun). This allows most Terraform commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis action can be run on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners. When running on `windows-latest` the shell should be set to Bash.\n\nThe default configuration installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and installs the wrapper script to wrap subsequent calls to the `terraform` binary:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n```\n\nA specific version of Terraform CLI can be installed:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n  with:\n    terraform_version: 1.1.7\n```\n\nCredentials for Terraform Cloud ([app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/)) can be configured:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n  with:\n    cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nCredentials for Terraform Enterprise (TFE) can be configured:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n  with:\n    cli_config_credentials_hostname: \'terraform.example.com\'\n    cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThe wrapper script installation can be skipped by setting the `terraform_wrapper` variable to `false`:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n  with:\n    terraform_wrapper: false\n```\n\nSubsequent steps can access outputs when the wrapper script is installed:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n\n- run: terraform init\n\n- id: plan\n  run: terraform plan -no-color\n\n- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}\n- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stderr }}\n- run: echo ${{ steps.plan.outputs.exitcode }}\n```\n\nOutputs can be used in subsequent steps to comment on the pull request:\n\n> **Notice:** There\'s a limit to the number of characters inside a GitHub comment (65535).\n>\n> Due to that limitation, you might end up with a failed workflow run even if the plan succeeded.\n>\n> Another approach is to append your plan into the $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY environment variable which supports markdown.\n\n```yaml\ndefaults:\n  run:\n    working-directory: ${{ env.tf_actions_working_dir }}\npermissions:\n  pull-requests: write\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n\n- name: Terraform fmt\n  id: fmt\n  run: terraform fmt -check\n  continue-on-error: true\n\n- name: Terraform Init\n  id: init\n  run: terraform init\n\n- name: Terraform Validate\n  id: validate\n  run: terraform validate -no-color\n\n- name: Terraform Plan\n  id: plan\n  run: terraform plan -no-color\n  continue-on-error: true\n\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  if: github.event_name == \'pull_request\'\n  env:\n    PLAN: ""terraform\\n${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}""\n  with:\n    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    script: |\n      const output = `#### Terraform Format and Style \xf0\x9f\x96\x8c\\`${{ steps.fmt.outcome }}\\`\n      #### Terraform Initialization \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f\\`${{ steps.init.outcome }}\\`\n      #### Terraform Validation \xf0\x9f\xa4\x96\\`${{ steps.validate.outcome }}\\`\n      <details><summary>Validation Output</summary>\n\n      \\`\\`\\`\\n\n      ${{ steps.validate.outputs.stdout }}\n      \\`\\`\\`\n\n      </details>\n\n      #### Terraform Plan \xf0\x9f\x93\x96\\`${{ steps.plan.outcome }}\\`\n\n      <details><summary>Show Plan</summary>\n\n      \\`\\`\\`\\n\n      ${process.env.PLAN}\n      \\`\\`\\`\n\n      </details>\n\n      *Pusher: @${{ github.actor }}, Action: \\`${{ github.event_name }}\\`, Working Directory: \\`${{ env.tf_actions_working_dir }}\\`, Workflow: \\`${{ github.workflow }}\\`*`;\n\n      github.rest.issues.createComment({\n        issue_number: context.issue.number,\n        owner: context.repo.owner,\n        repo: context.repo.repo,\n        body: output\n      })\n```\n\nInstead of creating a new comment each time, you can also update an existing one:\n\n```yaml\ndefaults:\n  run:\n    working-directory: ${{ env.tf_actions_working_dir }}\npermissions:\n  pull-requests: write\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2\n\n- name: Terraform fmt\n  id: fmt\n  run: terraform fmt -check\n  continue-on-error: true\n\n- name: Terraform Init\n  id: init\n  run: terraform init\n\n- name: Terraform Validate\n  id: validate\n  run: terraform validate -no-color\n\n- name: Terraform Plan\n  id: plan\n  run: terraform plan -no-color\n  continue-on-error: true\n\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  if: github.event_name == \'pull_request\'\n  env:\n    PLAN: ""terraform\\n${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}""\n  with:\n    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    script: |\n      // 1.

Defaults to `app.terraform.io`.\n- `cli_config_credentials_token` - (optional) The API token for a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise instance to\n   place within the credentials block of the Terraform CLI configuration file.\n- `terraform_version` - (optional) The version of Terraform CLI to install. Instead of a full version string,\n   you can also specify a constraint string (see [Semver Ranges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#ranges)\n   for available range specifications). Examples are: `<1.2.0`, `~1.1.0`, `1.1.7` (all three installing\n   the latest available `1.1` version). Prerelease versions can be specified and a range will stay within the\n   given tag such as `beta` or `rc`. If no version is given, it will default to `latest`.\n- `terraform_wrapper` - (optional) Whether to install a wrapper to wrap subsequent calls of\n   the `terraform` binary and expose its STDOUT, STDERR, and exit code as outputs\n   named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively. Defaults to `true`.\n\n## Outputs\n\nThis action does not configure any outputs directly. However, when you set the `terraform_wrapper` input\nto `true`, the following outputs are available for subsequent steps that call the `terraform` binary:\n\n- `stdout` - The STDOUT stream of the call to the `terraform` binary.\n- `stderr` - The STDERR stream of the call to the `terraform` binary.\n- `exitcode` - The exit code of the call to the `terraform` binary.\n\n## License\n\n[Mozilla Public License v2.0](LICENSE)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n## Experimental Status\n\nBy using the software in this repository (the ""Software""), you acknowledge that: (1) the Software is still in development, may change, and has not been released as a commercial product by HashiCorp and is not currently supported in any way by HashiCorp; (2) the Software is provided on an ""as-is"" basis, and may include bugs, errors, or other issues;  (3) the Software is NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE, use of the Software may result in unexpected results, loss of data, or other unexpected results, and HashiCorp disclaims any and all liability resulting from use of the Software; and (4) HashiCorp reserves all rights to make all decisions about the features, functionality and commercial release (or non-release) of the Software, at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### License Headers\n\nAll source code files (excluding autogenerated files like `package.json`, prose, and files excluded in [.copywrite.hcl](.copywrite.hcl)) must have a license header at the top.\n\nThis can be autogenerated by installing the HashiCorp [`copywrite`](https://github.com/hashicorp/copywrite#getting-started) tool and running `copywrite headers` in the root of the repository.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

446,"b'# Github action for `checkpatch.pl`\n\nThe `checkpatch.pl` is a perl script to verify that your code conforms to the Linux kernel coding style. This project uses `checkpatch.pl` to automatically review and leave comments on pull requests.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Result of checkpatch\n\n![check](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/webispy/checkpatch-action/img/action_conversation_check.png)\n\n### Code annotations\n\n![annotations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/webispy/checkpatch-action/img/action_annotations.png)\n\nYou can also check the comments directly in the console log.\n\n![console log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/webispy/checkpatch-action/img/action_console.png)\n\n## Action setup guide\n\n### Pull Request\n\n.github/workflows/main.yml\n\n```yml\nname: checkpatch review\non: [pull_request]\njobs:\n  my_review:\n    name: checkpatch review\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: \'Calculate PR commits + 1\'\n      run: echo ""PR_FETCH_DEPTH=$(( ${{ github.event.pull_request.commits }} + 1 ))"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      with:\n        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n        fetch-depth: ${{ env.PR_FETCH_DEPTH }}\n    - name: Run checkpatch review\n      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@v9\n```\n\nFor using a custom checkpatch script, pass the `CHECKPATCH_COMMAND` environment\nvariable. For example, for DPDK\'s `checkpatches.sh` script use:\n\n```yml\nname: checkpatch review\non: [pull_request]\njobs:\n  my_review:\n    name: checkpatch review\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: \'Calculate PR commits + 1\'\n      run: echo ""PR_FETCH_DEPTH=$(( ${{ github.event.pull_request.commits }} + 1 ))"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      with:\n        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n        fetch-depth: ${{ env.PR_FETCH_DEPTH }}\n    - name: Run DPDK checkpatches.sh review\n      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@v9\n      env:\n        DPDK_CHECKPATCH_PATH: /usr/bin/checkpatch.pl\n        CHECKPATCH_COMMAND: ./devtools/checkpatches.sh\n```\n\n**Note:** For **private repositories** this action needs access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It needs read access to `contents` and `pull-requests` as minimum permissions. For example:\n\n```yml\nname: checkpatch review\non: [pull_request]\njobs:\n  my_review:\n    name: checkpatch review\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: read\n    steps:\n    - name: \'Calculate PR commits + 1\'\n      run: echo ""PR_FETCH_DEPTH=$(( ${{ github.event.pull_request.commits }} + 1 ))"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      with:\n        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n        fetch-depth: ${{ env.PR_FETCH_DEPTH }}\n    - name: Run checkpatch review\n      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@v9\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n```\n\n### `checkpatch.pl` configuration\n\nThe `checkpatch.pl` tool supports a configuration file for setting options.

This action allows [existing messages to be updated](#updating-an-existing-message) to reduce unwanted noise in your Slack channel. Heavily-inspired by [Post Slack messages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/post-slack-message).\n\nA [Slack bot token](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types) is required to use this action, and the associated app must be granted permission to post in the channel, private group or DM you specify.\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\nuses: voxmedia/github-action-slack-notify-build@v1\nwith:\n  channel: app-alerts\n  status: STARTED\n  color: good\nenv:\n  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThe Slack notification leverages attachments to group important information together and provide valuable links:\n\n<img src=""docs/push.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the push event"" width=""540"">\n\nWhen used with the `pull_request` event, a link to the originating pull request is included:\n\n<img src=""docs/pr.png"" alt=""Screenshot of the pull_request event"" width=""540"">\n\n### Updating an Existing Message\n\nIf you need to send multiple Slack build updates and you prefer to update a single message instead of posting multiple messages, you can pass a `message_id` to future steps.\n\n<img src=""docs/updating_message.gif"" alt=""Updating existing messages"" width=""540"">\n\nNote: You must assign a step `id` to the first Slack notification step in order to reference it for future steps:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Notify slack success\n  if: success()\n  id: slack # IMPORTANT: reference this step ID value in future Slack steps\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: voxmedia/github-action-slack-notify-build@v1\n  with:\n    channel: app-alerts\n    status: STARTING\n    color: warning\n\n- name: Run tests\n  # ... your test step here\n- name: Notify slack success\n  if: success()\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: voxmedia/github-action-slack-notify-build@v1\n  with:\n    # Updates existing message from the first step\n    message_id: ${{ steps.slack.outputs.message_id }}\n    channel: app-alerts\n    status: SUCCESS\n    color: good\n```\n\n### Reporting Success or Failure\n\nYou can use the `success()` and `failure()` conditional checks within your workflow to determine which build notification to send:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Run tests\n  # ... your test step here\n- name: Notify slack success\n  if: success()\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: voxmedia/github-action-slack-notify-build@v1\n  with:\n    channel: app-alerts\n    status: SUCCESS\n    color: good\n\n- name: Notify slack fail\n  if: failure()\n  env:\n    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_BOT_TOKEN }}\n  uses: voxmedia/github-action-slack-notify-build@v1\n  with:\n    channel: app-alerts\n    status: FAILED\n    color: danger\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `status`\n\n**Required** The status to show for the action, e.g. `STARTED` or `FAILED`.\n\n### `channel`\n\nThe name of the channel to post the message to. **Required** if no `channel_id` is provided.\n\n_Note_: If your workspace has many channels, supplying only a `channel` may cause rate limiting issues with this GitHub Action. Consider supplying a `channel_id` instead.\n\n### `channel_id`\n\nThe ID of the channel to post the message to. **Required** if no `channel` is provided, or if you need to send to a DM.\n\n### `color`\n\nThe color to use for the notification. Can be a hex value or any [valid Slack color level](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments#fields) (e.g. `good`). Defaults to `#cccccc`.\n\n### `message_id`\n\nThe ID of a previous Slack message to update instead of posting a new message. Typically passed using the `steps` context:\n\n```yaml\nmessage_id: ${{ steps.<your_first_slack_step_id>.outputs.message_id }}\n```\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `message_id`\n\nReturns the unique message ID, which is a timestamp which can be passed to future Slack API calls as `ts`.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use this GitHub Action, you\'ll need a [Slack bot token](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types). A bot token must be associated with a Slack app.\n\n### Creating a Slack App\n\n1. **Create a Slack App.** Go to Slack\'s developer site then click ""Create an app"". Name the app ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and make sure your team\'s Slack workspace is selected under ""Development Slack Workspace"".\n1. **Add a Bot user.** Browse to the ""Bot users"" page listed in the sidebar. Name your bot ""GitHub Action"" (you can change this later) and leave the other default settings as-is.\n1. **Set an icon for your bot.** Browse to the ""Basic information"" page listed in the sidebar. Scroll down to the section titled ""Display information"" to set an icon.\n1. **Install your app to your workspace.** At the top of the ""Basic information"" page, you can find a section titled ""Install your app to your workspace"". Click on it, then use the button to complete the installation.\n\n### Slack App OAuth Scopes\n\nIn order to use your Slack App with this GitHub Action, be sure to enable the following OAuth scopes:\n\n| Scope           | Required?                                  |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| `chat:write`    | Yes                                        |\n| `channels:read` | If using `channel` instead of `channel_id` |\n| `groups:read`   | If using `channel` instead of `channel_id` |\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

458,"b'# OpenWrt GitHub Action SDK\n\nGitHub CI action to build packages via SDK using official OpenWrt SDK Docker\ncontainers. This is primary used to test build OpenWrt repositories but can\nalso be used for downstream projects maintaining their own package\nrepositories.\n\n## Example usage\n\nThe following YAML code can be used to build all packages of a repository and\nstore created `ipk` files as artifacts.\n\n```yaml\nname: Test Build\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: ${{ matrix.arch }} build\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        arch:\n          - x86_64\n          - mips_24kc\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - name: Build\n        uses: openwrt/gh-action-sdk@main\n        env:\n          ARCH: ${{ matrix.arch }}\n\n      - name: Store packages\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          name: ${{ matrix.arch}}-packages\n          path: bin/packages/${{ matrix.arch }}/packages/*.ipk\n```\n\n## Environmental variables\n\nThe action reads a few env variables:\n\n* `ARCH` determines the used OpenWrt SDK Docker container.\n* `ARTIFACTS_DIR` determines where built packages and build logs are saved.\n  Defaults to the default working directory (`GITHUB_WORKSPACE`).\n* `BUILD_LOG` stores build logs in `./logs`.\n* `CONTAINER` can set other SDK containers than `openwrt/sdk`.\n* `EXTRA_FEEDS` are added to the `feeds.conf`, where `|` are replaced by white\n  spaces.\n* `FEED_DIR` used in the created `feeds.conf` for the current repo. Defaults to\n  the default working directory (`GITHUB_WORKSPACE`).\n* `FEEDNAME` used in the created `feeds.conf` for the current repo. Defaults to\n  `action`.\n* `IGNORE_ERRORS` can ignore failing packages builds.\n* `KEY_BUILD` can be a private Signify/`usign` key to sign the packages feed.\n* `INDEX` makes the action build the package index. Default is 0. Set to 1 to enable.\n* `NO_DEFAULT_FEEDS` disable adding the default SDK feeds\n* `NO_REFRESH_CHECK` disable check if patches need a refresh.\n* `NO_SHFMT_CHECK` disable check if init files are formated\n* `V` changes the build verbosity level.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Check out the repository code\n2. Provision a cheap AWS Lightsail instance, with docker and docker-compose set up\n3. Continuously deploy the specified pull requests and branches, using your docker-compose file(s)\n4. Report the preview instance URL in the GitHub UI\n\nIt is designed to be the **no-nonsense, cheap, and secure** alternative to\nservices that require access to your code and force your app to fit within\ntheir specific deployment system and/or require a specific config file.\n\n<img src=""img/2-add-label.png"">\n<img src=""img/3-deploy-starts.png"">\n<img src=""img/5-view-deployment.png"">\n<img src=""img/6-deploy-next-commit-pending.png"">\n\n## Useful for the entire team\n\n- **Product Owners**: Interact with a new feature as it\'s built, give valuable feedback earlier, reduce wasted development time.\n- **Developers**: Show your work in progress, find bugs early, deliver the right feature.\n- **Ops**: Concentrate on high value tasks, not maintaining staging environments.\n- **CTOs**: Don\'t let your code run on third-party servers: your code always stays private on either GitHub\'s or your servers.\n\n## Features\n\nPreview environments that:\n\n- work with your **existing tooling**: If your app can be started with\n  docker-compose, it can be deployed to preview environments with PullPreview.\n\n- can be **started and destroyed easily**: You can manage preview environments\n  by adding or removing the `pullpreview` label on your Pull Requests. You can\n  set specific branches as always on, for instance to continuously deploy your\n  master branch.\n\n- are **cheap too run**: Preview environments are launched on AWS Lightsail\n  instances, which are both very cheap (10USD per month, proratized to the\n  duration of the PR), and all costs included (bandwith, storage, etc.)\n\n- take the **privacy** of your code seriously: The workflow happens all within\n  a GitHub Action, which means your code never leaves GitHub or your Lightsail\n  instances.\n\n- make the preview URL **easy to find** for your reviewers: Deployment statuses\n  and URLs are visible in the PR checks section, and on the Deployments tab in\n  the GitHub UI.\n\n- **persist state** across deploys: Any state stored in docker volumes (e.g.\n  database data) will be persisted across deploys, making the life of reviewers\n  easier.\n\n- are **easy to troubleshoot**: You can give specific GitHub users the\n  authorization to SSH into the preview instance (with sudo privileges) to\n  further troubleshoot any issue. The SSH keys that they use to push to GitHub\n  will automatically be installed on the preview servers.\n\n- are **integrated into the GitHub UI**: Logs for each deployment run are\n  available within the Actions section, and direct links to the preview\n  environments are available in the Checks section of a PR, and in the\n  Deployments tab of the repository.\n\n<img src=""img/4-view-logs.png"" />\n<img src=""img/8-list-deployments.png"" />\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\n- [Getting Started](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/Getting-Started)\n- Action [Inputs](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/Inputs) / [Outputs](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/Outputs)\n- Handling [Seed Data](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/Seed-Data)\n- [Workflow Examples](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/Workflow-Examples)\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki/FAQ)\n\n&rarr; Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/pullpreview/action/wiki) for the full documentation.\n\n## Example\n\nWorkflow file with the `master` branch always on:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/pullpreview.yml\nname: PullPreview\non:\n  # the schedule is optional, but helps to make sure no dangling resources are left when GitHub Action does not behave properly\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""30 2 * * *""\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    types: [labeled, unlabeled, synchronize, closed, reopened]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    if: github.event_name == \'schedule\' || github.event_name == \'push\' || github.event.label.name == \'pullpreview\' || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, \'pullpreview\')\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    timeout-minutes: 30\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: pullpreview/action@v5\n        with:\n          # Those GitHub users will have SSH access to the servers\n          admins: crohr,other-github-user\n          # A staging environment will always exist for the master branch\n          always_on: main\n          # Use the cidrs option to restrict access to the live environments to specific IP ranges\n          cidrs: ""0.0.0.0/0""\n          # PullPreview will use those 2 files when running docker-compose up\n          compose_files: docker-compose.yml,docker-compose.pullpreview.yml\n          # The preview URL will target this port\n          default_port: 80\n          # Use a 512MB RAM instance type instead of the default 2GB\n          instance_type: nano_2_0\n          # Ports to open on the server\n          ports: 80,5432\n        env:\n          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ""${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}""\n          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ""${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}""\n          AWS_REGION: ""us-east-1""\n```\n\n## Is this free?\n\nThe code for this Action is completely open source, and licensed under the\nProsperity Public License (see LICENSE).\n\nIf you are a non-profit individual, then it is free to run (in that case, please tell me\nso and/or pass the word around!).\n\nIn all other cases, you must buy a license.

Building using this actions still takes ~3:30 min less time than [snapcore/action-build].\n\n[snapcore/action-build]: https://github.com/snapcore/action-build\n[snapcore/action-publish]: https://github.com/snapcore/action-publish\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic\n\nTo use this action, add the following step to your workflow:\n\n```yml\n- name: Install Snapcraft\n  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v2\n```\n\nA full example:\n\n```yml\nname: My workflow\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install Snapcraft\n        uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v2\n\n      # You can now run Snapcraft shell commands\n      - name: Use Snapcraft\n        run: snapcraft --help\n```\n\n### Log in\n\nThis action can also log you in to the Snap Store. For this to work, you need an [Ubuntu One account](https://snapcraft.io/account).\n\nYou will also need a Snap Store login token. To obtain one, run the following command on your machine:\n\n```sh\nsnapcraft export-login --snaps SNAP_NAME --channels edge -\n```\n\nNOTE: You will need to manually push a package to the Snap Store to get a valid SNAP_NAME first.\n\nCopy that token and add it as a secret to GitHub Actions. You can do this in your GitHub repository under Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. You can name it `SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN` for convenience.\n\nSet `SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable either in:\n\n- root yml file: to be available for all jobs\n- inside a job: to be available inside a specific job (recommended), or\n- inside a step: to be available only in a specific step\n\n```yml\nenv:\n  SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.SNAPCRAFT_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nFinally, add the following option to your workflow step:\n\n```yml\n- name: Install Snapcraft\n  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v2\n  with:\n    skip_install: true # optional, if already installed in an earlier step\n```\n\n### Build using LXD\n\nUsing `runs-on: ubuntu-20.04` or later, LXD is availabe by default. If using `runs-on: ubuntu-18.04`, LXD can be installed as shown below. This is an alternative to using `multipass` (GitHub VMs give the error `launch failed: CPU does not support KVM extensions.` when trying to use `multipass`).\n\n```yml\n- name: Install Snapcraft with LXD\n  uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v2\n  with:\n    use_lxd: ${{ matrix.os == 'ubuntu-18.04' }}\n- name: Build snap\n  run: sg lxd -c 'snapcraft --use-lxd'\n```\n\n## Development\n\nSuggestions and contributions are always welcome!

464,"b'<img src=""http://159.65.210.101/php-actions.png"" align=""right"" alt=""PHP Actions for Github"" />\n\nUse the Composer CLI in your Github Actions.\n============================================\n\nComposer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on, and it will manage (install/update) them for you.\n\nIf you are running tests like [PHPUnit][php-actions-phpunit], [phpspec][php-actions-phpspec] or [Behat][php-actions-behat] in your Github actions, chances are you will need to install your project\'s dependencies using Composer.\n\nAn example repository has been created at https://github.com/php-actions/example-composer to show how to use this action in a real project. The repository also depends on a private dependency and uses SSH keys for authentication.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCreate your Github Workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or similar.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n    # ... then your own project steps ...\n```\n\n### Version numbers\n\nThis action is released with semantic version numbers, but also tagged so the latest major release\'s tag always points to the latest release within the matching major version.\n\nPlease feel free to use `uses: php-actions/composer@v6` to always run the latest version of v6, or `uses: php-actions/composer@v6.0.0` to specify the exact release.\n\n\nRunning custom commands\n-----------------------\n\nBy default, adding `- uses: php-actions/composer@v6` into your workflow will run `composer install`, as `install` is the default command name. The `install` command will be provided with a default set of arguments (see below).\n\nYou can issue custom commands by passing a `command` input, like so:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      with:\n        command: your-command-here\n```\n\nPassing arguments\n-----------------\n\nAny arbitrary arguments can be passed to composer by using the `args` input, however there are a few inputs pre-configured to handle common arguments. All inputs are optional. Please see the following list:\n\n+ `interaction` - Whether to ask any interactive questions - yes / no (default `no`)\n+ `dev` - Whether to install dev packages - yes / no (default `yes`)\n+ `progress` - Whether to output download progress - yes / no (default `no`)\n+ `quiet` - Whether to suppress all messages - yes / no (default `no`)\n+ `args` - Optional arguments to pass - no constraints (default _empty_)\n+ `only_args` - Only run the desired command with this args. Ignoring all other provided arguments(default _empty_)\n+ `php_version` - Choose which version of PHP you want to use - x.y (default `latest`) (e.g. `7.4.29`, 8.2`, or any version listed on https://www.php.net/releases/index.php)\n+ `version` - Choose which version of Composer you want to use - default `latest` (e.g. `1.10`, `2.3`, `2.5.4`)\n+ `memory_limit` - Sets the composer memory limit - (default _empty_)\n\nThere are also SSH input available: `ssh_key`, `ssh_key_pub` and `ssh_domain` that are used for depending on private repositories. See below for more information on usage.\n\nExample of a yaml config that does not want to install dev packages, and passes the `--profile` and `--ignore-platform-reqs` arguments:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      with:\n        dev: no\n        args: --profile --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\nUsing different versions of PHP or Composer\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis action runs on a custom base image, available at https://github.com/php-actions/php-build which allows for switching the active PHP version on-the-fly, and this repository allows switching of Composer versions on-the-fly.\n\nUse the following inputs to run a specific PHP/Composer version combination:\n\n+ `php_version` Available versions: `7.1`, `7.2`, `7.3`, `7.4`, `8.0`, `8.1` (default: `latest` aka: `8.1`)\n+ `version` Available versions: `latest`, `preview`, `snapshot`, `1.x`, `2.x`, `2.2.x` or the exact version (default: `latest`)\n\nMake sure to put the PHP version number in quotes, otherwise YAML will interpret e.g. `8.0` as `8` which means latest 8.x, not 8.0.\n\nExample configuration that runs Composer version 1 on PHP version 7.1:\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      with:\n        php_version: ""7.1""\n        version: 1\n```\n\n\nIncluding PHP Extensions\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis action includes the [extensions that Composer suggests](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/composer.json#L44) by default. To include additional PHP extensions in your action steps, set the `php_extensions` input with any of the [supported extension names](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer#supported-php-extensions) separated by spaces.\n\nExample configuration that runs Composer version 2 on PHP version 7.4 with the Redis and Exif extensions enabled:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      with:\n        php_version: ""7.4""\n        php_extensions: redis exif\n        version: 2.x\n```\n\nCaching dependencies for faster builds\n--------------------------------------\n\nGithub actions supports dependency caching, allowing Composer downloads to be cached between workflows, as long as the `composer.lock` file has not changed. This produces much faster builds, as the `composer install` command does not have to download files over the network at all if the cache is valid.\n\nExample workflow (taken from https://github.com/PhpGt/Database):\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]\n    \n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Cache Composer dependencies\n      uses: actions/cache@v3\n      with:\n        path: /tmp/composer-cache\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/composer.lock\') }}\n      \n    - uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n\n    ...      \n```\n\nIn the example above, the ""key"" is passed to the Cache action that consists of a hash of the composer.lock file. This means that as long as the contents of composer.lock doesn\'t change between workflows, the Composer cache directory will be persisted between workflows.\n\nInstalling private repositories\n-------------------------------\n\nTo install from a private repository, SSH authentication must be used. Generate an SSH key pair for this purpose and add it to your private repository\'s configuration, preferable with only read-only privileges. On Github for instance, this can be done by using [deploy keys][deploy-keys]. \n\nAdd the key pair to your project using  [Github Secrets][secrets], and pass them into the `php-actions/composer` action by using the `ssh_key` and `ssh_key_pub` inputs. If your private repository is stored on another server than github.com, you also need to pass the domain via `ssh_domain`. If the private repository is configured to use a non-standard SSH port, you can configure this by passing `ssh_port`.\n\nExample yaml, showing how to pass secrets:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      with:\n        ssh_key: ${{ secrets.ssh_key }}\n        ssh_key_pub: ${{ secrets.ssh_key_pub }}\n```\n\nThere is an example repository available for reference at https://github.com/php-actions/example-composer that uses a private dependency. Check it out for a live working project.\n\n### HTTP basic authentication\n\nIt\'s recommended to use SSH keys for authentication, but sometimes HTTP basic authentication is the only tool available at the time. In order to use this authentication mechanism as securely as possible, please follow these steps:\n\n1) Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for the Github account you wish to authenticate with.\n\n2) Create a new GitHub Secret called `PAT` with a value of personal access token.\n\n3) Pass this secret to COMPOSER_AUTH variable:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    ...\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      uses: php-actions/composer@v6\n      env:\n        COMPOSER_AUTH: \'{""github-oauth"": {""github.com"": ""${{ secrets.PAT }}""} }\'\n```\n\n4) Now, any connections Composer makes to GitHub.com will use your HTTP basic auth credentials, which is essentially the same as being logged in as you, so your private repositories will now be available to Composer.\n\n***\n\nIf you found this repository helpful, please consider [sponsoring the developer][sponsor].\n\n[php-actions-phpunit]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/phpunit-php-actions \n[php-actions-phpspec]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/phpspec-php-actions \n[php-actions-behat]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/behat-php-actions \n[deploy-keys]: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys\n[secrets]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets\n[sponsor]: https://github.com/sponsors/g105b\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Class diagram will be created with option `--setting=graphs.enabled=true`.\n\nThere are 4 ways to install phpDocumentor:\n\n1. Using phive (recommended)\n2. Using the PHAR (manual install)\n3. Via [Docker]\n4. Via [Composer]\n\n### Using Phive\n\n`$ phive install --force-accept-unsigned phpDocumentor`\n\nFor more information about phive have a look at their [website](https://phar.io/).\nNow you have phpDocumentor installed, it can be executed like this:\n\n`php tools/phpDocumentor`\n\n### Using the PHAR\n\n1. Download the phar file from https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/releases\n2. You can execute the phar like this: `php phpDocumentor.phar`\n\n### Via Docker\n\n1. `$ docker pull phpdoc/phpdoc`\n2. `$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data phpdoc/phpdoc`\n\n### Via Composer (not recommended)\n\nBut wait? What about composer?\n\nAh, you discovered our secret. There is a phpdocumentor composer package that you can use to install phpDocumentor.\n\nHowever: phpDocumentor is a complex application, and its libraries are used in countless other libraries and applications (2 of our libraries have more than 150 million downloads each); and this means that the chances for a conflict between one of our dependencies and yours is high. And when I say high, it is really high.\n\nSo, because of the above: we do not endorse nor actively support installing phpDocumentor using Composer.\n\n### PEAR\n\nStarting from phpDocumentor v3 we decided to drop PEAR support due to declining use.\n\nHow to use phpDocumentor?\n-------------------------\n\nThe easiest way to run phpDocumentor is by running the following command:\n\n    $ phpdoc run -d <SOURCE_DIRECTORY> -t <TARGET_DIRECTORY>\n\nThis command will parse the source code provided using the `-d` argument and output it to the folder indicated by the `-t` argument.\n\nphpDocumentor supports a whole range of options to configure the output of your documentation.\nYou can execute the following command, or check our website, for a more detailed listing of available command-line options.\n\n    $ phpdoc run -h\n\nConfiguration file(s)\n---------------------\n\nphpDocumentor also supports the use of configuration files (named phpdoc.xml or phpdoc.dist.xml by default).\nPlease consult the documentation to see the format and supported options.\n\n### Nightly builds\n\nPhpDocumentor doesn't have nightly releases.\nHowever, during each pipeline a phar artifact is built.\nIf you want to test the bleeding edge version of phpDocumentor, have a look in the [actions] section of this repository.\nEach successful QA workflow has an Artifacts section at the bottom with the phar artifact built.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nReaching out to us is easy, and can be done with:\n\n* Twitter: [@phpDocumentor]\n* Website: https://www.phpdoc.org\n* GitHub:  https://www.github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor\n* E-mail:  [mike@phpdoc.org]\n\n[@phpDocumentor]: https://twitter.com/phpDocumentor\n[v2 branch]: https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/tree/2.9\n[Graphviz]: https://www.graphviz.org/download/\n[actions]: https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Qa+workflow%22+is%3Asuccess\n[Docker]: https://hub.docker.com/r/phpdoc/phpdoc/\n[Composer]: https://getcomposer.org/\n[mike@phpdoc.org]: mailto:mike@phpdoc.org\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Default is schema.\n\n## Basic Usage Example\n\nThis basic example validates specified XML file specified using: `xml-file` using the schema file specified using: `xml-schema-file`.\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  xml-linters:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - name: Download schema\n      run: wget https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/info.xsd\n    - name: Lint info.xml\n      uses: ChristophWurst/xmllint-action@v1\n      with:\n        xml-file: ./appinfo/info.xml\n        xml-schema-file: ./info.xsd\n```\n\n### Using alternate schema formats\n\nTo use an alternate schema format supported by `xmllint` (i.e. relaxng or schematron), you should specify the format of your schema using the optional `xml-schema-type` parameter.\n\n## Extended Usage Example Enabling Annotations\n\nThis example does the same as the above example, in addition it configures the use of [korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher@v1](https://github.com/korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher), which matches any problems found by `xmllint` and present these as annotations with both errors and warnings emitted from `xmllint`, which are a nice alternative to digging through the log files.\n\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non: [push]\n\njobs:\n  xml-linters:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - name: Download schema\n      run: wget https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/info.xsd\n    - name: Lint info.xml\n      uses: korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher@v1\n      uses: ChristophWurst/xmllint-action@v1\n      with:\n        xml-file: ./appinfo/info.xml\n        xml-schema-file: ./info.xsd\n```\n\n## Referenes\n\n- `xmllint` comes from [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/)\n- [GitHub: korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher](https://github.com/korelstar/xmllint-problem-matcher)\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If you are using extensions which have the result `Installed and enabled` in the logs like `pecl` extensions on `Ubuntu` or extensions which have custom support, it is recommended to use this action to cache your extensions.\n\n### Inputs\n\n#### `php-version` (optional)\n\n- Specify the PHP version you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'8.0\'`.\n- Accepts `latest` to set up the latest stable PHP version.\n- Accepts `nightly` to set up a nightly build from the master branch of PHP.\n- Accepts the format `d.x`, where `d` is the major version. For example `5.x`, `7.x` and `8.x`.\n- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.\n- If not specified, it looks for `php-version-file` input.\n\n#### `php-version-file` (optional)\n\n- Specify a file with the PHP version you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'.phpenv-version\'`.\n- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.\n- By default, `.php-version` file is used.\n- If not specified and the default `.php-version` file is not found, the latest stable PHP version is set up.\n\n#### `extensions` (required)\n\n- Specify the extensions you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string` in csv-format. For example `mbstring, xdebug, :opcache`.\n- Extensions prefixed with `:` are ignored in output cache key.\n\n#### `key` (required)\n\n- Specify the key to identify the cache version.\n- Accepts any `string`. For example `cache-v1`.\n- Changing this would reset the cache.\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml ""Metadata for this GitHub Action"") and usage below for more info.\n\n### Workflow\n\n> Cache extensions in a PHP workflow\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.operating-system }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        operating-system: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]\n        php-versions: [\'8.0\', \'8.1\', \'8.2\', \'8.3\']\n    name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }} Test on ${{ matrix.operating-system }}\n    env:\n      extensions: intl, pcov\n      key: cache-v1 # can be any string, change to clear the extension cache.\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Setup cache environment\n      id: extcache\n      uses: shivammathur/cache-extensions@v1\n      with:\n        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}\n        extensions: ${{ env.extensions }}\n        key: ${{ env.key }}\n\n    - name: Cache extensions\n      uses: actions/cache@v3\n      with:\n        path: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.dir }}\n        key: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.key }}\n        restore-keys: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.key }}\n\n    - name: Setup PHP\n      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n      with:\n        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}\n        extensions: ${{ env.extensions }}\n```\n\n### Thread Safe Setup\n\nIf you set up both `TS` and `NTS` PHP versions on `Ubuntu` or `Windows` in your workflow, please add `${{ env.phpts }}` to `key` and `restore-keys` inputs in `actions/cache` step in the above workflow to avoid a conflicting cache.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Cache extensions\n  uses: actions/cache@v3\n  with:\n    path: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.dir }}\n    key: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.key }}-${{ env.phpts }}\n    restore-keys: ${{ steps.extcache.outputs.key }}-${{ env.phpts }}\n```\n\n## :scroll: License\n\nThe code and documentation in this project are under the [MIT License](LICENSE ""License for shivammathur/cache-extensions"").

472,"b'# GitHub Action - Get a Release\n\nThis GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Get a Release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to get releases.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. My [yj](https://github.com/bruceadams/yj) project uses this Action, see [release.yml](https://github.com/bruceadams/yj/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\nThis Action requires that the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` be set correctly.\n\n### Outputs\n\nFor more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like\n\n- `id`: The release ID\n- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. For example `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`\n- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action\n- `tag_name`: The git tag associated with the release. For example: `v1.1.0`\n\n### Example workflow\n\nEverytime a new release is created, build a binary for the release and upload it to the release on GitHub. This example is building and uploading a Linux binary for a Rust executable.\n\n```yaml\non:\n  release:\n    types: [created]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Build release binary\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Get release\n        id: get_release\n        uses: bruceadams/get-release@v1.3.2\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}\n\n      - name: Build binary\n        run: cargo build --release --verbose\n\n      - name: Upload release binary\n        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1.0.2\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}\n        with:\n          upload_url: ${{ steps.get_release.outputs.upload_url }}\n          asset_path: ./target/release/my-widget\n          asset_name: my-widget\n          asset_content_type: application/octet-stream\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
473,"b'# GitHub Actions for deploying to Azure\n\n## Automate your GitHub workflows using Azure Actions\n\n[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow.\n\nWith [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/actions/), you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure.\n\n## GitHub Action for Azure Login\n\nWith the [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login/blob/master/action.yml) Action, you can do an Azure login using [Azure Managed Identities and Azure service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#managed-identity-types) to run Az CLI and Azure PowerShell scripts.\n\n- By default, the action only logs in with the Azure CLI (using the `az login` command). To log in with the Az PowerShell module, set `enable-AzPSSession` to true. To login to Azure tenants without any subscriptions, set the optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.\n\n- To login into one of the Azure Government clouds or Azure Stack, set the optional parameter `environment` with one of the supported values `AzureUSGovernment` or `AzureChinaCloud` or `AzureStack`. If this parameter is not specified, it takes the default value `AzureCloud` and connects to the Azure Public Cloud. Additionally, the parameter `creds` takes the Azure service principal created in the particular cloud to connect (Refer to the [Configure a service principal with a secret](#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret) section below for details).\n- The Action supports two different ways of authentication with Azure. One using the Azure Service Principal with secrets. The other is OpenID connect (OIDC) method of authentication using Azure [Workload Identity Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation). **We recommend using OIDC based authentication for increased security.**\n- To login using Azure Service Principal with a secret, follow [this](#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret) guidance.\n- To login using **OpenID Connect (OIDC) based Federated Identity Credentials**, you need to first configure trust between GitHub workflow and an Azure Managed Identity or an Azure AD App (Service Principal)\n   1. Follow [this](#configure-a-federated-credential-to-use-oidc-based-authentication) guidance to create a Federated Credential associated with your Azure Managed Identity or AD App (Service Principal). This is needed to establish OIDC trust between GitHub deployment workflows and the specific Azure resources scoped by the Managed Identity/service principal.\n   2. In your GitHub workflow, Set `permissions:` with `id-token: write` at workflow level or job level based on whether the OIDC token needs to be auto-generated for all Jobs or a specific Job.\n   3. Within the Job deploying to Azure, add Azure/login action and pass the `client-id` and `tenant-id` of the Azure Managed Identity/service principal associated with an OIDC Federated Identity Credential created in step (i). You also need to pass `subscription-id` or set `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.\n\nNote:\n\n- Ensure the CLI version is 2.30 or above to use OIDC support.\n- By default, Azure access tokens issued during OIDC based login could have limited validity. Azure access token issued by AD App (Service Principal) is expected to have an expiration of 1 hour by default. And with Managed Identities, it would be 24 hrs. This expiration time is further configurable in Azure. Refger to [access-token lifetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#access-token-lifetime) for more details.\n\n## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run az cli\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\non: [push]\n\nname: AzureLoginSample\n\njobs:\n\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    \n    - uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}\n    \n    - run: |\n        az webapp list --query ""[?state==\'Running\']""\n\n```\n\n## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run Azure PowerShell\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\non: [push]\n\nname: AzurePowerShellLoginSample\n\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    \n    - name: Login via Az module\n      uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS}}\n        enable-AzPSSession: true \n     \n     - run: |\n        Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName ""ResourceGroup11""\n        \n```\n\n## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action using OIDC to run az cli (Linux)\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/OIDC_workflow.yml\n\nname: Run Azure Login with OIDC\non: [push]\n\npermissions:\n      id-token: write\n      contents: read\njobs: \n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Az CLI login\n        uses: azure/login@v1\n        with:\n          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}\n          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}\n  \n      - name: Azure CLI script\n        uses: azure/CLI@v1\n        with:\n          azcliversion: latest\n          inlineScript: |\n            az account show\n            az group list\n```\n\nUsers can also specify `audience` field for access-token in the input parameters of the action. If not specified, it is defaulted to `api://AzureADTokenExchange`. This action supports login az powershell as well for both Windows and Linux runners by setting an input parameter `enable-AzPSSession: true`. Below is the sample workflow for the same using the Windows runner. Please note that powershell login is not supported in macOS runners.\n\n## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action using OIDC to run az PowerShell (Windows)\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/OIDC_workflow.yml\n\nname: Run Azure Login with OIDC\non: [push]\n\npermissions:\n      id-token: write\n      contents: read\n      \njobs: \n  Windows-latest:\n      runs-on: windows-latest\n      steps:\n        - name: OIDC Login to Azure Public Cloud with AzPowershell (enableAzPSSession true)\n          uses: azure/login@v1\n          with:\n            client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}\n            tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}\n            subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }} \n            enable-AzPSSession: true\n\n        - name: \'Get RG with powershell action\'\n          uses: azure/powershell@v1\n          with:\n             inlineScript: |\n               Get-AzResourceGroup\n             azPSVersion: ""latest""\n\n```\n\nRefer to the [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/azure/powershell) GitHub Action to run your Azure PowerShell scripts.\n\n## Sample to connect to Azure US Government cloud\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\n    - name: Login to Azure US Gov Cloud with CLI\n      uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_US_GOV_CREDENTIALS }}\n        environment: \'AzureUSGovernment\'\n        enable-AzPSSession: false\n    - name: Login to Azure US Gov Cloud with Az Powershell\n      uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_US_GOV_CREDENTIALS }}\n        environment: \'AzureUSGovernment\'\n        enable-AzPSSession: true\n```\n\nRefer to the [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/azure/powershell) GitHub Action to run your Azure PowerShell scripts.\n\n## Sample Azure Login workflow that uses Azure login action to run az cli on Azure Stack Hub\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\non: [push]\n\nname: AzureLoginSample\n\njobs:\n\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}\n        environment: \'AzureStack\'\n\n    - run: |\n        az webapp list --query ""[?state==\'Running\']""\n\n```\n\nRefer to the [Azure Stack Hub Login Action Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/ci-cd-github-action-login-cli?view=azs-2008) for more detailed instructions.\n\n## Configure deployment credentials\n  \n### Configure a service principal with a secret\n\nFor using any credentials like Azure Service Principal, Publish Profile etc add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.\n\nFollow the following steps to configure Azure Service Principal with a secret:\n\n- Define a new secret under your repository settings, Add secret menu\n- Store the output of the below [az cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) command as the value of secret variable, for example \'AZURE_CREDENTIALS\'\n\n```bash  \n\n   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""myApp"" --role contributor \\\n                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \\\n                            --sdk-auth\n```\n\nReplace `{subscription-id}` and `{resource-group}` with the subscription and resource group details, respectively.\n\nThe command should output a JSON object similar to this:\n\n ```bash\n  {\n    ""clientId"": ""<GUID>"",\n    ""clientSecret"": ""<STRING>"",\n    ""subscriptionId"": ""<GUID>"",\n    ""tenantId"": ""<GUID>"",\n    ""resourceManagerEndpointUrl"": ""<URL>""\n    (...)\n  }\n  \n```\n\n- Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret in Azure login action with your secret (Refer to the example above)\n- Note: The above `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command will give you the `--sdk-auth` deprecation warning. As we are working with CLI for this deprecation process, we strongly recommend users to use this `--sdk-auth` flag as the result dictionary output changes and not accepted by login action if `--sdk-auth` is not used.\n- If you want to pass Subscription ID, Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret as individual parameters instead of bundling them in a single JSON object (creds) to address the [security concerns](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for Non-OIDC login, below snippet can help with the same.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: Azure/login@v1\n    with:\n      creds: \'{""clientId"":""${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}"",""clientSecret"":""${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}"",""subscriptionId"":""${{ secrets.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}"",""tenantId"":""${{ secrets.TENANT_ID }}""}\'\n```\n\nIn a similar way, any additional parameter can be added to creds such as resourceManagerEndpointUrl for Azure Stack, for example.\n\n### Manually creating the Credentials object\n\nIf you already created and assigned a Service Principal in Azure you can manually create the .json object above by finding the `clientId` and `clientSecret` on the Service Principal, and your `subscriptionId` and `tenantId` of the subscription and tenant respectively. The `resourceManagerEndpointUrl` will be `https://management.azure.com/` if you are using the public Azure cloud.\n\n### Configure a Federated Credential to use OIDC based authentication\n\nPlease refer to Microsoft\'s documentation at [""Configure a federated identity credential on an app\xe2\x80\x9d](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions) and [""Configure a user-assigned managed identity""](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity?pivots=identity-wif-mi-methods-azp#github-actions-deploying-azure-resources) to trust an external identity provider (preview) which has more details about the Azure Workload Identity Federation (OIDC) support.\n\nYou can add federated credentials in the Azure portal or with the Microsoft Graph REST API.\n\n## Support for using `allow-no-subscriptions` flag with az login\n\nCapability has been added to support access to tenants without subscriptions for both OIDC and non-OIDC. This can be useful to run tenant level commands, such as `az ad`. The action accepts an optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` which is `false` by default.\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\non: [push]\n\nname: AzureLoginWithNoSubscriptions\n\njobs:\n\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n    - uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}\n        allow-no-subscriptions: true\n```\n\n## Az logout and security hardening\n\nThis action doesn\'t implement ```az logout``` by default at the end of execution. However there is no way of tampering the credentials or account information because the github hosted runner is on a VM that will get reimaged for every customer run which gets everything deleted. But if the runner is self-hosted which is not github provided it is recommended to manually logout at the end of the workflow as shown below. More details on security of the runners can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners).\n\n```yaml\n- name: Azure CLI script\n  uses: azure/CLI@v1\n  with:\n    inlineScript: |\n      az logout\n      az cache purge\n      az account clear\n```\n\n## Az CLI dependency\n\nInternally in this action, we use azure CLI and execute `az login` with the credentials provided through secrets. In order to validate the new az CLI releases for this action, [canary test workflow](.github/workflows/azure-login-canary.yml) is written which will execute the action on [az CLI\'s edge build](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#edge-builds) which will fail incase of any breaking change is being introduced in the new upcoming release. The test results can be posted on a slack or teams channel using the corresponding integrations. Incase of a failure, the concern will be raised to [azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) for taking a necessary action and also the latest CLI installation will be postponed in [Runner VMs](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) as well for hosted runner to prevent the workflows failing due to the new CLI changes.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

474,"b'# GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Web App\n\nWith the Azure App Service Actions for GitHub, you can automate your workflow to deploy [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) or [Azure Web Apps for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/) using GitHub Actions.\n\nGet started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source).\n\nThis repository contains GitHub Action for Azure WebApp to deploy to an Azure WebApp (Windows or Linux). The action supports deploying a folder, *\\*.jar*, *\\*.war*, and \\**.zip* files (except msBuild generated packages).\n\nYou can also use this GitHub Action to deploy your customized image into an Azure WebApps container.\n\nFor deploying container images to Kubernetes, consider using [Kubernetes deploy](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-deploy) action. This action requires that the cluster context be set earlier in the workflow by using either the [Azure/aks-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/aks-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action or the [Azure/k8s-set-context](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-set-context/tree/releases/v1) action.\n\nThe definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy/blob/master/action.yml). *startup-command* is applicable only for Linux apps and not for Windows apps. Currently *startup-command* is supported only for Linux apps when SPN is provided and not when publish profile is provided.\n\nNOTE: you must have write permissions to the repository in question. If you\'re using a sample repository from Microsoft, be sure to first fork the repository to your own GitHub account.\n\n# End-to-End Sample Workflows\n\n## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions\n\n* [Checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) your Git repository content into GitHub Actions agent.\n* Authenticate using [Azure Web App Publish Profile](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deployment-credentials#site-credentials-aka-publish-profile-credentials) or using the [Azure Login Action](https://github.com/Azure/login). Examples of both are given later in this article.\n\n    The action supports using publish profile for [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) (both Windows and Linux) and [Azure Web Apps for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/) (both Windows and Linux).\n    \n **Note: As of October 2020, Linux web apps will need the app setting `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` set to `true` before downloading the publish profile from the portal. This requirement will be removed in the future.**\n\n    The action does not support multi-container scenario with publish profile.\n* Enable [Run from Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-run-package#enable-running-from-package), otherwise remote build will take time and the deployment will take longer. \n\n* To build app code in a specific language based environment, use setup actions:\n  * [Setup DotNet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) Sets up a dotnet environment by optionally downloading and caching a version of dotnet by SDK version and adding to PATH.\n  * [Setup Node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) sets up a node environment by optionally downloading and caching a version of node - npm by version spec and add to PATH\n  * [Setup Python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) sets up Python environment by optionally installing a version of python and adding to PATH.\n  * [Setup Java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) sets up Java app environment optionally downloading and caching a version of java by version and adding to PATH. Downloads from [Azul\'s Zulu distribution](http://static.azul.com/zulu/bin/).\n\n* To build and deploy a containerized app, use [docker-login](https://github.com/Azure/docker-login) to log in to a private container registry such as [Azure Container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/).\n\nOnce login is done, the next set of Actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging and pushing containers.\n  \n## Create Azure Web App and deploy using GitHub Actions\n\nNote: Workflow samples with sample application code and deployment procedure for various **runtime** environments are given at https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService.\n\nFor example, if You want to deploy a Java WAR based app, You can follow the link https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Java-application-petstore-ee7 in the sample workflow templates.\n\n0. Review the pre-requisites outlined in the [""Dependencies on Other Github Actions""](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy#dependencies-on-other-github-actions) section above.\n1. Create a web app in Azure using app service. Follow the tutorial [Azure Web Apps Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview#next-steps).\n2. Pick a template from the following table depends on your Azure web app **runtime** and place the template to `.github/workflows/` in your project repository.\n3. Change `app-name` to your Web app name created in the first step.\n4. Commit and push your project to GitHub repository, you should see a new GitHub Action initiated in **Actions** tab.\n\n|  Runtime | Template |\n|------------|---------|\n| DotNet     | [dotnet.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService/asp.net-core-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n| Node       | [node.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService/node.js-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n| Java | [java_jar.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService/java-jar-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n| Java      | [java_war.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService/java-war-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n| Python     | [python.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService/python-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n| PHP        | [php.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/AppService/php-webapp-on-azure.yml)\n| DOCKER     | [docker.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/AppService/docker-webapp-container-on-azure.yml) |\n| GO     | [go.yml](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/AppService/go-webapp-on-azure.yml) |\n\n### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js Web app to Azure using publish profile\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    # checkout the repo\n    - name: \'Checkout Github Action\' \n      uses: actions/checkout@master\n\n    - name: Setup Node 10.x\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n      with:\n        node-version: \'10.x\'\n    - name: \'npm install, build, and test\'\n      run: |\n        npm install\n        npm run build --if-present\n        npm run test --if-present\n\n    - name: \'Run Azure webapp deploy action using publish profile credentials\'\n      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2\n      with:\n        app-name: node-rn\n        publish-profile: ${{ secrets.azureWebAppPublishProfile }}\n\n```\n\n### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js app to Containerized WebApp using publish profile\n\n```yaml\non: [push]\n\nname: Linux_Container_Node_Workflow\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    # checkout the repo\n    - name: \'Checkout Github Action\'\n      uses: actions/checkout@master\n\n    - uses: azure/docker-login@v1\n      with:\n        login-server: contoso.azurecr.io\n        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}\n\n    - run: |\n        docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}\n        docker push contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }} \n\n    - uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2\n      with:\n        app-name: \'node-rnc\'\n        publish-profile: ${{ secrets.azureWebAppPublishProfile }}\n        images: \'contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}\'\n```\nWebapps deploy Actions is supported for the Azure public cloud as well as Azure government clouds (\'AzureUSGovernment\' or \'AzureChinaCloud\') and Azure Stack (\'AzureStack\') Hub. Before running this action, login to the respective Azure Cloud  using [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) by setting appropriate value for the `environment` parameter.\n\n#### Configure deployment credentials:\n\nFor any credentials like Azure Service Principal, Publish Profile etc add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.\n\nThe above example uses app-level credentials i.e., publish profile file for deployment. \n\nFollow the steps to configure the secret:\n\n* **Note: As of October 2020, Linux web apps will need the app setting `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` set to `true` before continuing with next step of downloading the publish profile. This requirement will be removed in the future.**\n* Download the publish profile for the WebApp from the portal (Get Publish profile option)\n* While deploying to slot, download the publish profile for slot. Also specify the `slot-name` field with the name of the slot.\n* Define a new secret under your repository settings, Add secret menu\n* Paste the contents for the downloaded publish profile file into the secret\'s value field\n* Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret for the input `publish-profile:` of the deploy Azure WebApp action (Refer to the example above)\n\n### Sample workflow to build and deploy a Node.js app to Containerized WebApp using Azure service principal\n\nUse [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) with a service principal that\'s authorized for Web app deployment. Once login is done, the next set of Azure actions in the workflow can re-use the same session within the job.\n\n```yaml\non: [push]\n\nname: Linux_Container_Node_Workflow\n\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    # checkout the repo\n    - name: \'Checkout Github Action\'\n      uses: actions/checkout@master\n\n    - name: \'Login via Azure CLI\'\n      uses: azure/login@v1\n      with:\n        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}\n\n    - uses: azure/docker-login@v1\n      with:\n        login-server: contoso.azurecr.io\n        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}\n\n    - run: |\n        docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}\n        docker push contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }} \n\n    - uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2\n      with:\n        app-name: \'node-rnc\'\n        images: \'contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}\'\n```\n\n#### Configure deployment credentials:\n\nThe previous sample workflow depends on user-level credentials stored as a [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your repository. The value of this secret is expected to be a JSON object that represents a service principal (an identifer for an application or process) that authenticates the workflow with Azure.\n\nTo function correctly, this service principal must be assigned the [Contributor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)) role for the web app or the resource group that contains the web app.\n\nThe following steps describe how to create the service principal, assign the role, and create a secret in your repository with the resulting credentials.\n\n1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com). You can alternately use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you\'ve installed it locally. (For more information on Cloud Shell, see the [Cloud Shell Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).)\n  \n2. Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command to create a service principal and assign a Contributor role:\n\n    ```azurecli\n    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""{sp-name}"" --sdk-auth --role contributor \\\n        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name}\n    ```\n\n    Replace the following:\n      * `{sp-name}` with a suitable name for your service principal, such as the name of the app itself. The name must be unique within your organization.\n      * `{subscription-id}` with the subscription you want to use\n      * `{resource-group}` the resource group containing the web app.\n      * `{app-name}` with the name of the web app.\n\n    This command invokes Azure Active Directory (via the `ad` part of the command) to create a service principal (via `sp`) specifically for [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (via `create-for-rbac`).\n\n    The `--role` argument specifies the permissions to grant to the service principal at the specified `--scope`. In this case, you grant the built-in [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role at the scope of the web app in the specified resource group in the specified subscription.\n\n    If desired, you can omit the part of the scope starting with `/providers/...` to grant the service principal the Contributor role for the entire resource group:\n\n    ```azurecli  \n    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ""{sp-name}"" --sdk-auth --role contributor \\\n        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}\n    ```\n\n    For security purposes, however, it\'s always preferable to grant permissions at the most restrictive scope possible.\n\n3. When complete, the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command displays JSON output in the following form (which is specified by the `--sdk-auth` argument):\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      ""clientId"": ""<GUID>"",\n      ""clientSecret"": ""<GUID>"",\n      ""subscriptionId"": ""<GUID>"",\n      ""tenantId"": ""<GUID>"",\n      (...)\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. In your repository, use **Add secret** to create a new secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (as shown in the example workflow), or using whatever name is in your workflow file.\n\n5. Paste the entire JSON object produced by the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command as the secret value and save the secret.\n\nNOTE: to manage service principals created with `az ad sp create-for-rbac`, visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Active Directory, then select **Manage** > **App registrations** on the left-hand menu. Your service principal should appear in the list. Select a principal to navigate to its properties. You can also manage role assignments using the [az role assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest) command.\n\n#### Configure web app private registry credentials\n\nThis sample assumes the `node-rnc` web application has been previously configured to authenticate against the private registry. If you wish to set private registry authentication settings on the workflow, you can either use:\n\n* The command [az webapp config container](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp/config/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-config-container-set) to configure the registry url, username and password.\n\n* Setup the authentication settings using [azure/appservice-settings action](https://github.com/Azure/appservice-settings), like this for example\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Set Web App ACR authentication\n      uses: Azure/appservice-settings@v1\n      with:\n       app-name: \'node-rnc\'\n       app-settings-json: |\n         [\n             {\n                 ""name"": ""DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PASSWORD"",\n                 ""value"": ""${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}"",\n                 ""slotSetting"": false\n             },\n             {\n                 ""name"": ""DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL"",\n                 ""value"": ""https://contoso.azurecr.io"",\n                 ""slotSetting"": false\n             },\n             {\n                 ""name"": ""DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_USERNAME"",\n                 ""value"": ""${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME  }}"",\n                 ""slotSetting"": false\n             }\n         ]\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Inspired by [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), this action helps development teams to keep a change file up to date as new features or fixes are implemented. \n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this action, follow the typical GitHub Action `uses` syntax. An example workflow using the default parameters of this action is shown below:\n\n```yaml\nname: ""Pull Request Workflow""\non:\n  pull_request:\n    # The specific activity types are listed here to include ""labeled"" and ""unlabeled""\n    # (which are not included by default for the ""pull_request"" trigger).\n    # This is needed to allow skipping enforcement of the changelog in PRs with specific labels,\n    # as defined in the (optional) ""skipLabels"" property.\n    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review, labeled, unlabeled]\n\njobs:\n  # Enforces the update of a changelog file on every pull request \n  changelog:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: dangoslen/changelog-enforcer@v3\n```\n\nOther examples can be seen in the [example-workflows](./example-workflows) directory in this repository.\n\n_:warning: The Changelog Enforcer is designed to be used with the `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` event types. Using this action on any other event type will result in a warning logged and the action succeeding (as to not block the rest of a workflow)._\n\n### Inputs / Properties\n\nBelow are the properties allowed by the Changelog Enforcer. These properties are shipped with sane defaults for typical use, especially for changelogs inline with the [KeepAChangelog](Keepachangelog.org) format.\n\n#### `changeLogPath`\n* Default: `CHANGELOG.md`\n* The path to your changelog file. Should be from the perspective of the root directory to `git`. The file being checked for updates must be either an add (`A`) or modified (`M`) status to `git` to qualify as updated. \n\n#### `skipLabels` \n* Default: `\'Skip-Changelog\'` \n* List of labels used to skip enforcing of the changelog during a pull request. Each label name is comma separated and only one label needs to be present for enforcement to be skipped.\n\n  For example, if `label-1,label-2` was supplied as the `skipLabels`, `label-1` _or_ `label-2` would skip the enforcer. Each label is trimmed for leading and trailing spaces since GitHub labels do not allow for leading or trailing spaces. Thus, the following lists are equivalent:\n  * `label-1,label-2`\n  * `label-1 , label-2`\n  * `label-1  ,label-2`\n\n#### `missingUpdateErrorMessage`\n* Default: `\'\'`\n* Custom error message to use when no update to the changelog is found.\n\n#### `expectedLatestVersion`\n* Default: `\'\'`\n* The latest version of the software expected in the changelog. Should be in the form of `v1.1.0`, `v3.5.6` etc. Allows for the first version in the changelog to be an unreleased      version (either `unreleased|Unreleased|UNRELEASED`) before checking versions. If the only version in the changelog is an unreleased version, no validation occurs. This is to support a repository adding a changelog after other versions have been released and don\'t want to backport previous versions (though doing so is recommended).\n\n#### `versionPattern`\n* Default: `\'## \\\\[((v|V)?\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*-?\\\\w*|unreleased|Unreleased|UNRELEASED)\\\\]\'`\n* A regex pattern used to extract the version section headings from the changelog. The Changelog Enforcer assumes the use of the [KeepAChangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) convention for section headings, and as such looks for a line starting with `## [version] - date`. Versions are only extracted from the changelog when enforcing the expected latest version (via the `expectedLatestVersion` property).\n\n  If you supply your own regex to match a different format, your regex must match the version string as a capture group (in the default format, that\'s the part inside square brackets). The first capture group will be used if your regex includes multiple groups. The regex pattern is used with global and multiline flags to find all of the versions in the changelog.\n\n  Because the regex is passed as a `String` object, you will need to escape backslash characters (`\\`) via `\\\\`.\n\n#### `token`\n* Default: `${{ github.token }}`\n* The token used to authenticate to the GitHub API. Uses the default token from the `github.token` context. Can be any access token you have  configured for your repository.\n\n### Outputs\n\n#### `errorMessage`\n* The reason for why the Changelog Enforcer failed. Uses the `missingUpdateErrorMessage` property value if set when no update to the changelog is found.\n\n### Creating Releases Automatically\n\nUsing this Action and the [Changelog Reader](https://github.com/mindsers/changelog-reader-action), plus a few standard GitHub created Actions, we can keep the changelog of a project up to date and create a GitHub release automatically with contents from the changelog. See this project\'s [release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml) for how to set up a simple workflow to create a new release based on a `VERSION` file and a changelog.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Bet your CI doesn't do that.\n\n## Usage\n\n`.github/workflows/lint.yml`:\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non: pull_request\n\njobs:\n  eslint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: hallee/eslint-action@1.0.3\n        # GITHUB_TOKEN in forked repositories is read-only\n        # https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request\n        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }} \n        with:\n          repo-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n          source-root: optional-sub-dir\n```\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Github now provides that feature by default, so you do not need this.\n\nInstead of this action, use:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  lint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      # This sets up a ""problem matcher"" for eslint and standard\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n      # Now you can just run eslint or standard yourself\n      - run: npx standard\n```\n\nThe old readme is archived below.\n\n---\n\n# standard-action\n\nGithub Action to lint with &#x60;standard&#x60;\n\n[Usage](#usage) - [License: Apache-2.0](#license)\n\n![Screenshot with Annotations](screenshot.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nIn a Github Actions workflow file, do something like:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  lint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: goto-bus-stop/standard-action@v1\n        with:\n          # optionally select a different, standard-like linter\n          # linter: semistandard\n\n          # optionally select a different eslint formatter for the log output, default \'stylish\'\n          # formatter: tap\n\n          # limit the files to lint, default \'**/*.js\'\n          # files: src/*.js\n\n          # show errors in the the github diff UI\n          annotate: true\n\n        # Allow the action to add lint errors to the github diff UI\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n```\n\nTo use a different linter than `standard`, or use a specific version of `standard`, add it as a devDependency to your project, and run `npm install` in your workflow so the action can `require()` it.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n- run: npm install\n- uses: goto-bus-stop/standard-action@v1\n  with:\n    linter: semistandard\n```\n\nIf you do not install any linter yourself, this action will use Standard v14.\n\n## Multiple globs\n\n`with.files` must contain a string, so to pass multiple globs, you need to use a single glob string:\n```yaml\n- uses: goto-bus-stop/standard-action@v1\n  with:\n    files: \'{src/**/*.js,test/**/*.js}\'\n```\n\n## License\n\n[Apache-2.0](LICENSE.md)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The file may contain any of the following configuration options:\n\n### Plugin readme location\n\nBy default, the app checks for readme in `readme.txt` and `plugin/readme.txt`. If the readme of your plugin is not in one of these locations, you can configure the app to look somewhere else with the `readme` value in the configuration. The value can be either a single location or an array of locations to check - if multiple locations are provided, they will be checked in the given order until the first match.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```json\n{\n    ""readme"": ""path/to/your/readme.txt""\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    ""readme"": [""path/to/first/readme.txt"", ""path/to/second/readme.txt""]\n}\n```\n\n### WordPress release channel\n\nBy default, the app will only notify you once the new WordPress version is released (**This will change** - starting from version 2.0, the default value will be changed to `rc`). By setting the `channel` value to one of `stable` or `rc`, you can choose to be notified when the new version is fully release, is in the release candidate (RC) stage of development or when the first beta versions are released.\n\n#### Example\n\n```json\n{\n    ""channel"": ""rc""\n}\n```\n\n### Issue assignees\n\nBy default, the issue will have no assignees. If you want the issues to be automatically assigned to someone, you can put their GitHub usernames in the config as the `assignees` value.\n\n#### Example\n\n```json\n{\n    ""assignees"": [""alice"", ""bob""]\n}\n```\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
