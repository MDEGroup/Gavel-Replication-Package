Set `fetch-depth: 0` to fetch all history for all branches and tags. Refer [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) to learn which commit `$GITHUB_SHA` points to for different events.\n\nThe auth token is persisted in the local git config. This enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The token is removed during post-job cleanup.

If not supplied, the action will try to resolve the version from the default `.python-version` file. If the `.python-version` file doesn't exist Python or PyPy version from the PATH will be used. The default version of Python or PyPy in PATH varies between runners and can be changed unexpectedly so we recommend always setting Python version explicitly using the `python-version` or `python-version-file` inputs.\n\nThe action will first check the local [tool cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#hosted-tool-cache) for a [semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#versions) match. If unable to find a specific version in the tool cache, the action will attempt to download a version of Python from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/actions/python-versions/releases) and for PyPy from the official [PyPy's dist](https://downloads.python.org/pypy/).\n\nFor information regarding locally cached versions of Python or PyPy on GitHub hosted runners, check out [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).\n\n## Supported version syntax\n\nThe `python-version` input supports the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) and some special version notations (e.g. `semver ranges`, `x.y-dev syntax`, etc.), for detailed examples please refer to the section: [Using python-version input](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-input) of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) guide.\n\n## Supported architectures\n\nUsing `architecture` input it is possible to specify the required Python or PyPy interpreter architecture: `x86` or `x64`. If the input is not specified the architecture defaults to `x64`.\n\n## Caching packages dependencies\n\nThe action has built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood for caching dependencies but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are `pip`, `pipenv` and `poetry`. The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.\n\nThe action defaults to searching for a dependency file (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for pip, `Pipfile.lock` for pipenv or `poetry.lock` for poetry) in the repository, and uses its hash as a part of the cache key. Input `cache-dependency-path` is used for cases when multiple dependency files are used, they are located in different subdirectories or different files for the hash that want to be used.\n\n - For `pip`, the action will cache the global cache directory\n - For `pipenv`, the action will cache virtualenv directory\n - For `poetry`, the action will cache virtualenv directories -- one for each poetry project found\n\n**Caching pip dependencies:**\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n  with:\n    python-version: '3.9'\n    cache: 'pip' # caching pip dependencies\n- run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n>**Note:** Restored cache will not be used if the requirements.txt file is not updated for a long time and a newer version of the dependency is available which can lead to an increase in total build time.\n\n>The requirements file format allows for specifying dependency versions using logical operators (for example chardet>=3.0.4) or specifying dependencies without any versions. In this case the pip install -r requirements.txt command will always try to install the latest available package version. To be sure that the cache will be used, please stick to a specific dependency version and update it manually if necessary.\n\nSee examples of using `cache` and `cache-dependency-path` for `pipenv` and `poetry` in the section: [Caching packages](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages) of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) guide.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n- [Using the python-version input](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-input)\n- [Using the python-version-file input](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-file-input)\n- [Check latest version](docs/advanced-usage.md#check-latest-version)\n- [Caching packages](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages)\n- [Outputs and environment variables](docs/advanced-usage.md#outputs-and-environment-variables)\n- [Available versions of Python and PyPy](docs/advanced-usage.md#available-versions-of-python-and-pypy)\n- [Hosted tool cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#hosted-tool-cache) \n- [Using `setup-python` with a self-hosted runner](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-setup-python-with-a-self-hosted-runner)\n- [Using `setup-python` on GHES](docs/advanced-usage.md#using-setup-python-on-ghes)\n- [Allow pre-releases](docs/advanced-usage.md#allow-pre-releases)\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

3,"b'# Upload-Artifact v3\n\nThis uploads artifacts from your workflow allowing you to share data between jobs and store data once a workflow is complete.\n\nSee also [download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact).\n\n# What\'s new\n\n- Easier upload\n  - Specify a wildcard pattern\n  - Specify an individual file\n  - Specify a directory (previously you were limited to only this option)\n  - Multi path upload\n    - Use a combination of individual files, wildcards or directories\n    - Support for excluding certain files\n- Upload an artifact without providing a name\n- Fix for artifact uploads sometimes not working with containers\n- Proxy support out of the box\n- Port entire action to typescript from a runner plugin so it is easier to collaborate and accept contributions\n\nRefer [here](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/tree/releases/v1) for the previous version\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n### Upload an Individual File\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- run: mkdir -p path/to/artifact\n\n- run: echo hello > path/to/artifact/world.txt\n\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/to/artifact/world.txt\n```\n\n### Upload an Entire Directory\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/to/artifact/ # or path/to/artifact\n```\n\n### Upload using a Wildcard Pattern\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/**/[abc]rtifac?/*\n```\n\n### Upload using Multiple Paths and Exclusions\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: |\n      path/output/bin/\n      path/output/test-results\n      !path/**/*.tmp\n```\n\nFor supported wildcards along with behavior and documentation, see [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) which is used internally to search for files.\n\nIf a wildcard pattern is used, the path hierarchy will be preserved after the first wildcard pattern:\n\n```\npath/to/*/directory/foo?.txt =>\n    \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/some/directory/foo1.txt\n    \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/some/directory/foo2.txt\n    \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/other/directory/foo1.txt\n\nwould be flattened and uploaded as =>\n    \xe2\x88\x9f some/directory/foo1.txt\n    \xe2\x88\x9f some/directory/foo2.txt\n    \xe2\x88\x9f other/directory/foo1.txt\n```\n\nIf multiple paths are provided as input, the least common ancestor of all the search paths will be used as the root directory of the artifact. Exclude paths do not affect the directory structure.\n\nRelative and absolute file paths are both allowed. Relative paths are rooted against the current working directory. Paths that begin with a wildcard character should be quoted to avoid being interpreted as YAML aliases.\n\nThe [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) package is used internally to handle most of the logic around uploading an artifact. There is extra documentation around upload limitations and behavior in the toolkit repo that is worth checking out.\n\n### Customization if no files are found\n\nIf a path (or paths), result in no files being found for the artifact, the action will succeed but print out a warning. In certain scenarios it may be desirable to fail the action or suppress the warning. The `if-no-files-found` option allows you to customize the behavior of the action if no files are found:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/to/artifact/\n    if-no-files-found: error # \'warn\' or \'ignore\' are also available, defaults to `warn`\n```\n\n### Conditional Artifact Upload\n\nTo upload artifacts only when the previous step of a job failed, use [`if: failure()`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  if: failure()\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/to/artifact/\n```\n\n### Uploading without an artifact name\n\nYou can upload an artifact without specifying a name\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    path: path/to/artifact/world.txt\n```\n\nIf not provided, `artifact` will be used as the default name which will manifest itself in the UI after upload.\n\n### Uploading to the same artifact\n\nWith the following example, the available artifact (named `artifact` by default if no name is provided) would contain both `world.txt` (`hello`) and `extra-file.txt` (`howdy`):\n\n```yaml\n- run: echo hi > world.txt\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    path: world.txt\n\n- run: echo howdy > extra-file.txt\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    path: extra-file.txt\n\n- run: echo hello > world.txt\n- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    path: world.txt\n```\n\nEach artifact behaves as a file share. Uploading to the same artifact multiple times in the same workflow can overwrite and append already uploaded files:\n\n```yaml\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n          node-version: [8.x, 10.x, 12.x, 13.x]\n    steps:\n        - name: Create a file\n          run: echo ${{ matrix.node-version }} > my_file.txt\n        - name: Accidentally upload to the same artifact via multiple jobs\n          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n          with:\n              name: my-artifact\n              path: ${{ github.workspace }}\n```\n\n> **_Warning:_** Be careful when uploading to the same artifact via multiple jobs as artifacts may become corrupted. When uploading a file with an identical name and path in multiple jobs, uploads may fail with 503 errors due to conflicting uploads happening at the same time. Ensure uploads to identical locations to not interfere with each other.\n\nIn the above example, four jobs will upload four different files to the same artifact but there will only be one file available when `my-artifact` is downloaded. Each job overwrites what was previously uploaded. To ensure that jobs don\'t overwrite existing artifacts, use a different name per job:\n\n```yaml\n          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n          with:\n              name: my-artifact ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n              path: ${{ github.workspace }}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables and Tilde Expansion\n\nYou can use `~` in the path input as a substitute for `$HOME`. Basic tilde expansion is supported:\n\n```yaml\n  - run: |\n      mkdir -p ~/new/artifact\n      echo hello > ~/new/artifact/world.txt\n  - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n    with:\n      name: Artifacts-V3\n      path: ~/new/**/*\n```\n\nEnvironment variables along with context expressions can also be used for input. For documentation see [context and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions):\n\n```yaml\n    env:\n      name: my-artifact\n    steps:\n    - run: |\n        mkdir -p ${{ github.workspace }}/artifact\n        echo hello > ${{ github.workspace }}/artifact/world.txt\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: ${{ env.name }}-name\n        path: ${{ github.workspace }}/artifact/**/*\n```\n\nFor environment variables created in other steps, make sure to use the `env` expression syntax\n\n```yaml\n    steps:\n    - run: | \n        mkdir testing\n        echo ""This is a file to upload"" > testing/file.txt\n        echo ""artifactPath=testing/file.txt"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: artifact\n        path: ${{ env.artifactPath }} # this will resolve to testing/file.txt at runtime\n```\n\n### Retention Period\n\nArtifacts are retained for 90 days by default. You can specify a shorter retention period using the `retention-days` input:\n\n```yaml\n  - name: Create a file\n    run: echo ""I won\'t live long"" > my_file.txt\n\n  - name: Upload Artifact\n    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n    with:\n      name: my-artifact\n      path: my_file.txt\n      retention-days: 5\n```\n\nThe retention period must be between 1 and 90 inclusive. For more information see [artifact and log retention policies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy).\n\n## Where does the upload go?\n\nAt the bottom of the workflow summary page, there is a dedicated section for artifacts. Here\'s a screenshot of something you might see:\n\n<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16109154/103645952-223c6880-4f59-11eb-8268-8dca6937b5f9.png"" width=""700"" height=""300"">\n\nThere is a trashcan icon that can be used to delete the artifact. This icon will only appear for users who have write permissions to the repository.\n\nThe size of the artifact is denoted in bytes. The displayed artifact size denotes the raw uploaded artifact size (the sum of all the individual files uploaded during the workflow run for the artifact), not the compressed size. When you click to download an artifact from the summary page, a compressed zip is created with all the contents of the artifact and the size of the zip that you download may differ significantly from the displayed size. Billing is based on the raw uploaded size and not the size of the zip.\n\n# Limitations\n\n### Zipped Artifact Downloads\n\nDuring a workflow run, files are uploaded and downloaded individually using the `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions. However, when a workflow run finishes and an artifact is downloaded from either the UI or through the [download api](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/artifacts/#download-an-artifact), a zip is dynamically created with all the file contents that were uploaded. There is currently no way to download artifacts after a workflow run finishes in a format other than a zip or to download artifact contents individually. One of the consequences of this limitation is that if a zip is uploaded during a workflow run and then downloaded from the UI, there will be a double zip created.\n\n### Permission Loss\n\n:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.\n\n### Case Insensitive Uploads\n\n:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.\n\n### Maintaining file permissions and case sensitive files\n\nIf file permissions and case sensitivity are required, you can `tar` all of your files together before artifact upload. Post download, the `tar` file will maintain file permissions and case sensitivity:\n\n```yaml\n  - name: Tar files\n    run: tar -cvf my_files.tar /path/to/my/directory\n\n  - name: Upload Artifact\n    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n    with:\n      name: my-artifact\n      path: my_files.tar\n```\n\n### Too many uploads resulting in 429 responses\n\nA very minute subset of users who upload a very very large amount of artifacts in a short period of time may see their uploads throttled or fail because of `Request was blocked due to exceeding usage of resource \'DBCPU\' in namespace` or `Unable to copy file to server StatusCode=TooManyRequests`.\n\nTo reduce the chance of this happening, you can reduce the number of HTTP calls made during artifact upload by zipping or archiving the contents of your artifact before an upload starts. As an example, imagine an artifact with 1000 files (each 10 Kb in size). Without any modification, there would be around 1000 HTTP calls made to upload the artifact. If you zip or archive the artifact beforehand, the number of HTTP calls can be dropped to single digit territory. Measures like this will significantly speed up your upload and prevent uploads from being throttled or in some cases fail.\n\n## Additional Documentation\n\nSee [Storing workflow data as artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) for additional examples and tips.\n\nSee extra documentation for the [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/artifact/docs/additional-information.md) package that is used internally regarding certain behaviors and limitations.\n\n# License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The default is `public`.\nOnly the contents of this dir are pushed to GitHub Pages branch, `gh-pages` by default.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./out  # default: public\n```\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Deploy to Subdirectory `destination_dir`\n\n*This feature is on beta.*\n*Any feedback is welcome at [Issue #324](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/324)*\n\nA destination subdirectory on a publishing branch.

(e.g. `public/CNAME`)\n\nFor more details about the `CNAME` file, read the official documentation: [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    cname: github.com\n```\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Enable Built-in Jekyll `enable_jekyll`\n\nIf you want GitHub Pages to process your site with the static site generator Jekyll, set `enable_jekyll` to true.\n\nBy default, this action signals to GitHub Pages that the site shall not be processed with Jekyll. This is done by adding an empty `.nojekyll` file on your publishing branch. When that file already exists, this action does nothing.\n\nBypassing Jekyll makes the deployment faster and is necessary if you are deploying files or directories that start with underscores, since Jekyll considers these to be special resources and does not copy them to the final site. You only need to set `enable_jekyll` to true when you want to deploy a Jekyll-powered website and let GitHub Pages do the Jekyll processing.\n\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    enable_jekyll: true\n```\n\nFor more details about `.nojekyll`: [Bypassing Jekyll on GitHub Pages - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/)\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Allow empty commits `allow_empty_commit`\n\nBy default, a commit will not be generated when no file changes. If you want to allow an empty commit, set the optional parameter `allow_empty_commit` to `true`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    allow_empty_commit: true\n```\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Keeping existing files `keep_files`\n\nBy default, existing files in the publish branch (or only in `destination_dir` if given) will be removed. If you want the action to add new files but leave existing ones untouched, set the optional parameter `keep_files` to `true`.\n\nNote that users who are using a Static Site Generator do not need this option in most cases. Please reconsider your project structure and building scripts, or use a built-in feature of a Static Site Generator before you enable this flag.\n\n- [Static Files | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/static-files/)\n- [Using the Static Folder | Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/static-folder/)\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    keep_files: true\n```\n\nWith the v3, this option does not support working with the force_orphan option. The next major release (version 4) will support this.\nSee [the issue #455](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/issues/455)\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Deploy to external repository `external_repository`\n\nBy default, your files are published to the repository which is running this action.\nIf you want to publish to another repository on GitHub, set the environment variable `external_repository` to `<username>/<external-repository>`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n    external_repository: username/external-repository\n    publish_branch: your-branch  # default: gh-pages\n    publish_dir: ./public\n```\n\nYou can use `deploy_key` or `personal_token`.\nWhen you use `deploy_key`, set your private key to the repository which includes this action and set your public key to your external repository.\n\n**Note that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has no permission to access to external repositories. Please create a personal access token and set it to `personal_token` like `personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}`.**\n\nUse case:\n\nA GitHub Free Plan account cannot use the GitHub Pages in a private repository. To make your source contents private and deploy it with the GitHub Pages, you can deploy your site from a private repository to a public repository using this option.\n\n- `peaceiris/homepage`: A private repository running this action with `external_repository: peaceiris/peaceiris.github.io`\n- `peaceiris/peaceiris.github.io`: A public repository using GitHub Pages\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Force orphan `force_orphan`\n\nWe can set the `force_orphan: true` option.\nThis allows you to make your publish branch with only the latest commit.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    force_orphan: true\n```\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set Git username and email\n\nSet custom `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.\nA commit is always created with the same user.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    user_name: \'github-actions[bot]\'\n    user_email: \'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\'\n```\n\n<img width=""400px"" alt=""Add GitHub Actions bot as a committer"" src=""./images/committer_github_actions_bot.jpg"">\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Set custom commit message\n\nSet a custom commit message.\nWhen we create a commit with a message `docs: Update some post`, a deployment commit will be generated with a message `docs: Update some post ${GITHUB_SHA}`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\n```\n\n<img width=""400px"" alt=""Set a custom commit message - GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages"" src=""./images/commit_message.jpg"">\n\nTo set a full custom commit message without a triggered commit hash,\nuse the `full_commit_message` option instead of the `commit_message` option.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n  with:\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n    publish_dir: ./public\n    full_commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\n```\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Create Git tag\n\nHere is an example workflow.\n\n```yaml\nname: GitHub Pages\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n    tags:\n      - \'v*.*.*\'\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    concurrency:\n      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Some build\n\n      - name: Prepare tag\n        id: prepare_tag\n        if: startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags/\')\n        run: |\n          echo ""DEPLOY_TAG_NAME=deploy-${TAG_NAME}"" >> ""${GITHUB_OUTPUT}""\n\n      - name: Deploy\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          publish_dir: ./public\n          tag_name: ${{ steps.prepare_tag.outputs.DEPLOY_TAG_NAME }}\n          tag_message: \'Deployment ${{ github.ref_name }}\'\n```\n\nCommands on a local machine.\n\n```console\n$ # On a main branch\n$ git tag -a ""v1.2.3"" -m ""Release v1.2.3""\n$ git push origin ""v1.2.3""\n\n$ # After deployment\n$ git fetch origin\n$ git tag\ndeploy-v1.2.3  # Tag on the gh-pages branch\nv1.2.3         # Tag on the main branch\n```\n\n<div align=""right"">\n<a href=""#table-of-contents"">Back to TOC \xe2\x98\x9d\xef\xb8\x8f</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n## Tips and FAQ\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f Create SSH Deploy Key\n\nGenerate your deploy key with the following command.\n\n```sh\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""$(git config user.email)"" -f gh-pages -N """"\n```\n\nYou will get 2 files:\n\n- `gh-pages.pub` is a public key\n- `gh-pages` is a private key\n\nNext, Go to **Repository Settings**\n\n- Go to **Deploy Keys** and add your public key with the **Allow write access**\n- Go to **Secrets** and add your private key as `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`\n\n| Add your public key | Success |\n|---|---|\n| ![](./images/deploy-keys-1.jpg) | ![](./images/deploy-keys-2.jpg) |\n\n| Add your private key | Success |\n|---|---|\n| ![](./images/secrets-1.jpg) | ![](./images/secrets-2.jpg) |\n\n### \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f First Deployment with `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limitations for the first deployment so we have to select the GitHub Pages branch on the repository settings tab.

This is to prevent the user from executing this action with a specific branch (like main).

Generate a RSA Key-Pair:\n\n### Generate rsa key\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n```\n\n### Generate ed25519 key\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n```\n\nAdd newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).\n\n### Add rsa key into Authorized keys\n\n```bash\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B \'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\'\n```\n\n### Add ed25519 key into Authorized keys\n\n```bash\ncat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh b@B \'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\'\n```\n\nCopy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.\n\n### Copy rsa Private key\n\n```bash\nclip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n### Copy ed25519 Private key\n\n```bash\nclip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nSee the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).\n\n**A note** from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:\n\n* Put the public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys2`\n* Change the permissions of `.ssh` to 700\n* Change the permissions of `.ssh/authorized_keys2` to 640\n\n### If you are using OpenSSH\n\nIf you are currently using OpenSSH and are getting the following error:\n\n```bash\nssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey]\n```\n\nMake sure that your key algorithm of choice is supported. On Ubuntu 20.04 or later you must explicitly allow the use of the ssh-rsa algorithm. Add the following line to your OpenSSH daemon file (which is either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or a drop-in file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):\n\n```bash\nCASignatureAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\n```\n\nAlternatively, `ed25519` keys are accepted by default in OpenSSH. You could use this instead of rsa if needed:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n```\n\n### Example\n\n#### Executing remote ssh commands using password\n\n```yaml\n- name: executing remote ssh commands using password\n  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    script: whoami\n```\n\n#### Using private key\n\n```yaml\n- name: executing remote ssh commands using ssh key\n  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    script: whoami\n```\n\n#### Multiple Commands\n\n```yaml\n- name: multiple command\n  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    script: |\n      whoami\n      ls -al\n```\n\n![result](./images/output-result.png)\n\n#### Multiple Hosts\n\n```diff\n  -

Before setting this up, run the command below to get your SSH host fingerprint. Remember to replace `ed25519` with your appropriate key type (`rsa`, `dsa`, etc.) that your server is using and `example.com` with your host.\n\nIn modern OpenSSH releases, the _default_ key types to be fetched are `rsa` (since version 5.1), `ecdsa` (since version 6.0), and `ed25519` (since version 6.7).\n\n```sh\nssh example.com ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | cut -d \' \' -f2\n```\n\nNow you can adjust you config:\n\n```diff\n  - name: ssh key passphrase\n    uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0\n    with:\n      host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n      username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n      key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n      port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n+     fingerprint: ${{ secrets.FINGERPRINT }}\n      script: |\n        whoami\n        ls -al\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would love for you to contribute to `appleboy/ssh-action`, pull requests are welcome!\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:\n   - untracked (new) files\n   - tracked (modified) files\n   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed\n2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.\n3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)\n- [Examples](docs/examples.md)\n- [Updating to v5](docs/updating.md)\n\n## Usage\n\n```yml\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      # Make changes to pull request here\n\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n```\n\nYou can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v5.x.x`\n\n### Workflow permissions\n\nFor this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests.\nThis setting can be found in a repository\'s settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.\n\nFor repositories belonging to an organization, this setting can be managed by admins in organization settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.\n\n### Action inputs\n\nAll inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.\n\n**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: push` or `on: pull_request` workflow then you cannot use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.\n\n| Name | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` |\n| `add-paths` | A comma or newline-separated list of file paths to commit. Paths should follow git\'s [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax. If no paths are specified, all new and modified files are added. See [Add specific paths](#add-specific-paths). | |\n| `commit-message` | The message to use when committing changes. | `[create-pull-request] automated change` |\n| `committer` | The committer name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. | `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` |\n| `author` | The author name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. | `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>` |\n| `signoff` | Add [`Signed-off-by`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. | `false` |\n| `branch` | The pull request branch name. | `create-pull-request/patch` |\n| `delete-branch` | Delete the `branch` when closing pull requests, and when undeleted after merging. | `false` |\n| `branch-suffix` | The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are `random`, `timestamp` and `short-commit-hash`. See [Alternative strategy](#alternative-strategy---always-create-a-new-pull-request-branch) for details. | |\n| `base` | Sets the pull request base branch. | Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow. |\n| `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork\'s branch into the parent\'s base. See [push pull request branches to a fork](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details. | |\n| `title` | The title of the pull request. | `Changes by create-pull-request action` |\n| `body` | The body of the pull request. | `Automated changes by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub action` |\n| `body-path` | The path to a file containing the pull request body.

It is not possible to change draft status after creation except through the web interface. | `false` |\n\nFor self-hosted runners behind a corporate proxy set the `https_proxy` environment variable.\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n        env:\n          https_proxy: http://<proxy_address>:<port>\n```\n\n### Action outputs\n\nThe following outputs can be used by subsequent workflow steps.\n\n- `pull-request-number` - The pull request number.\n- `pull-request-url` - The URL of the pull request.\n- `pull-request-operation` - The pull request operation performed by the action, `created`, `updated` or `closed`.\n- `pull-request-head-sha` - The commit SHA of the pull request branch.\n\nStep outputs can be accessed as in the following example.\nNote that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n      - name: Check outputs\n        if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}\n        run: |\n          echo ""Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}""\n          echo ""Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}""\n```\n\n### Action behaviour\n\nThe default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.\nChanges are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.\nAny subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.\n\nHow the action behaves:\n\n- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.\n- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.\n- If a pull request already exists it will be updated if necessary. Local changes in the Actions workspace, or changes on the base branch, can cause an update. If no update is required the action exits silently.\n- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.\n\nFor further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).\n\n#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch\n\nFor some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.\nThis strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.\n\nTo use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.\n\n- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`\n\n- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`\n\n- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`\n\n### Controlling committed files\n\nThe action defaults to adding all new and modified files.\nIf there are files that should not be included in the pull request, you can use the following methods to control the committed content.\n\n#### Remove files\n\nThe most straightforward way to handle unwanted files is simply to remove them in a step before the action runs.\n\n```yml\n      - run: |\n          rm -rf temp-dir\n          rm temp-file.txt\n```\n\n#### Ignore files\n\nIf there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.\n\n#### Add specific paths\n\nYou can control which files are committed with the `add-paths` input.\nPaths should follow git\'s [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax.\nFile changes that do not match one of the paths will be stashed and restored after the action has completed.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n        with:\n          add-paths: |\n            *.java\n            docs/*.md\n```\n\n#### Create your own commits\n\nAs well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.\nNote that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won\'t work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).\n\n```yml\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Create commits\n        run: |\n          git config user.name \'Peter Evans\'\n          git config user.email \'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com\'\n          date +%s > report.txt\n          git commit -am ""Modify tracked file during workflow""\n          date +%s > new-report.txt\n          git add -A\n          git commit -m ""Add untracked file during workflow""\n      - name: Uncommitted change\n        run: date +%s > report.txt\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n```\n\n### Create a project card\n\nTo create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n\n      - name: Create or Update Project Card\n        if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v2\n        with:\n          project-name: My project\n          column-name: My column\n          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}\n```\n\n### Auto-merge\n\nAuto-merge can be enabled on a pull request allowing it to be automatically merged once requirements have been satisfied.\nSee [enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) action for usage details.\n\n## Reference Example\n\nThe following workflow sets many of the action\'s inputs for reference purposes.\nCheck the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.\n\nSee [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  createPullRequest:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Make changes to pull request\n        run: date +%s > report.txt\n\n      - name: Create Pull Request\n        id: cpr\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commit-message: Update report\n          committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com>\n          author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>\n          signoff: false\n          branch: example-patches\n          delete-branch: true\n          title: \'[Example] Update report\'\n          body: |\n            Update report\n            - Updated with *today\'s* date\n            - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1]\n\n            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request\n          labels: |\n            report\n            automated pr\n          assignees: peter-evans\n          reviewers: peter-evans\n          team-reviewers: |\n            developers\n            qa-team\n          milestone: 1\n          draft: false\n```\n\nAn example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:\n\n![Pull Request Example](docs/assets/pull-request-example.png)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
8,"b'# Cache action\n\nThis action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.\n\n>Two other actions are available in addition to the primary `cache` action:\n>* [Restore action](./restore/README.md)\n>* [Save action](./save/README.md)\n\n[![Tests](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/cache/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [""Caching dependencies to speed up workflows""](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).\n\n## What\'s New\n\n### v3\n\n* Added support for caching in GHES 3.5+.\n* Fixed download issue for files > 2GB during restore.\n* Updated the minimum runner version support from node 12 -> node 16.\n* Fixed avoiding empty cache save when no files are available for caching.\n* Fixed tar creation error while trying to create tar with path as `~/` home folder on `ubuntu-latest`.\n* Fixed zstd failing on amazon linux 2.0 runners.\n* Fixed cache not working with github workspace directory or current directory.\n* Fixed the download stuck problem by introducing a timeout of 1 hour for cache downloads.\n* Fix zstd not working for windows on gnu tar in issues.\n* Allowing users to provide a custom timeout as input for aborting download of a cache segment using an environment variable `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS`. Default is 10 minutes.\n* New actions are available for granular control over caches - [restore](restore/action.yml) and [save](save/action.yml).\n* Support cross-os caching as an opt-in feature. See [Cross OS caching](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) for more info.\n* Added option to fail job on cache miss. See [Exit workflow on cache miss](./restore/README.md#exit-workflow-on-cache-miss) for more info.\n* Fix zstd not being used after zstd version upgrade to 1.5.4 on hosted runners\n* Added option to lookup cache without downloading it.\n* Reduced segment size to 128MB and segment timeout to 10 minutes to fail fast in case the cache download is stuck.\n\nSee the [v2 README.md](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/v2/README.md) for older updates.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your repository\'s `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-cache-workflow) is available below. For more information, see the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\nIf you are using this inside a container, a POSIX-compliant `tar` needs to be included and accessible from the execution path.\n\nIf you are using a `self-hosted` Windows runner, `GNU tar` and `zstd` are required for [Cross-OS caching](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache) to work. They are also recommended to be installed in general so the performance is on par with `hosted` Windows runners.\n\n### Inputs\n\n* `key` - An explicit key for a cache entry. See [creating a cache key](#creating-a-cache-key).\n* `path` - A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore. See [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) for supported patterns.\n* `restore-keys` - An ordered list of prefix-matched keys to use for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key.\n* `enableCrossOsArchive` - An optional boolean when enabled, allows Windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms. Default: `false`\n* `fail-on-cache-miss` - Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found. Default: `false`\n* `lookup-only` - If true, only checks if cache entry exists and skips download. Does not change save cache behavior. Default: `false`\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n* `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINS` - Segment download timeout (in minutes, default `10`) to abort download of the segment if not completed in the defined number of minutes.

For a partial key match via `restore-keys` or a cache miss, it will be set to `false`.\n\nSee [Skipping steps based on cache-hit](#skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit) for info on using this output\n\n### Cache scopes\n\nThe cache is scoped to the key, [version](#cache-version), and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches.\n\nSee [Matching a cache key](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key) for more info.\n\n### Example cache workflow\n\n#### Restoring and saving cache using a single action\n\n```yaml\nname: Caching Primes\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Cache Primes\n      id: cache-primes\n      uses: actions/cache@v3\n      with:\n        path: prime-numbers\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-primes\n\n    - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n      if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n      run: /generate-primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n\n    - name: Use Prime Numbers\n      run: /primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n```\n\nThe `cache` action provides a `cache-hit` output which is set to `true` when the cache is restored using the primary `key` and `false` when the cache is restored using `restore-keys` or no cache is restored.\n\n#### Using a combination of restore and save actions\n\n```yaml\nname: Caching Primes\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Restore cached Primes\n      id: cache-primes-restore\n      uses: actions/cache/restore@v3\n      with:\n        path: |\n          path/to/dependencies\n          some/other/dependencies\n        key: ${{ runner.os }}-primes\n    .\n    . //intermediate workflow steps\n    .\n    - name: Save Primes\n      id: cache-primes-save\n      uses: actions/cache/save@v3\n      with:\n        path: |\n          path/to/dependencies\n          some/other/dependencies\n        key: ${{ steps.cache-primes-restore.outputs.cache-primary-key }}\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> You must use the `cache` or `restore` action in your workflow before you need to use the files that might be restored from the cache. If the provided `key` matches an existing cache, a new cache is not created and if the provided `key` doesn\'t match an existing cache, a new cache is automatically created provided the job completes successfully.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nWith the introduction of the `restore` and `save` actions, a lot of caching use cases can now be achieved. Please see the [caching strategies](./caching-strategies.md) document for understanding how you can use the actions strategically to achieve the desired goal.\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\nEvery programming language and framework has its own way of caching.\n\nSee [Examples](examples.md) for a list of `actions/cache` implementations for use with:\n\n* [C# - NuGet](./examples.md#c---nuget)\n* [Clojure - Lein Deps](./examples.md#clojure---lein-deps)\n* [D - DUB](./examples.md#d---dub)\n* [Deno](./examples.md#deno)\n* [Elixir - Mix](./examples.md#elixir---mix)\n* [Go - Modules](./examples.md#go---modules)\n* [Haskell - Cabal](./examples.md#haskell---cabal)\n* [Haskell - Stack](./examples.md#haskell---stack)\n* [Java - Gradle](./examples.md#java---gradle)\n* [Java - Maven](./examples.md#java---maven)\n* [Node - npm](./examples.md#node---npm)\n* [Node - Lerna](./examples.md#node---lerna)\n* [Node - Yarn](./examples.md#node---yarn)\n* [OCaml/Reason - esy](./examples.md#ocamlreason---esy)\n* [PHP - Composer](./examples.md#php---composer)\n* [Python - pip](./examples.md#python---pip)\n* [Python - pipenv](./examples.md#python---pipenv)\n* [R - renv](./examples.md#r---renv)\n* [Ruby - Bundler](./examples.md#ruby---bundler)\n* [Rust - Cargo](./examples.md#rust---cargo)\n* [Scala - SBT](./examples.md#scala---sbt)\n* [Swift, Objective-C - Carthage](./examples.md#swift-objective-c---carthage)\n* [Swift, Objective-C - CocoaPods](./examples.md#swift-objective-c---cocoapods)\n* [Swift - Swift Package Manager](./examples.md#swift---swift-package-manager)\n* [Swift - Mint](./examples.md#swift---mint)\n\n## Creating a cache key\n\nA cache key can include any of the contexts, functions, literals, and operators supported by GitHub Actions.\n\nFor example, using the [`hashFiles`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#hashfiles) function allows you to create a new cache when dependencies change.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    with:\n      path: |\n        path/to/dependencies\n        some/other/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use arbitrary command output in a cache key, such as a date or software version:\n\n```yaml\n  # http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html\n  - name: Get Date\n    id: get-date\n    run: |\n      echo ""date=$(/bin/date -u ""+%Y%m%d"")"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n    shell: bash\n\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    with:\n      path: path/to/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ steps.get-date.outputs.date }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n```\n\nSee [Using contexts to create cache keys](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#using-contexts-to-create-cache-keys)\n\n## Cache Limits\n\nA repository can have up to 10GB of caches. Once the 10GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week will also be evicted.\n\n## Skipping steps based on cache-hit\n\nUsing the `cache-hit` output, subsequent steps (such as install or build) can be skipped when a cache hit occurs on the key.  It is recommended to install missing/updated dependencies in case of a partial key match when the key is dependent on the `hash` of the package file.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n  - uses: actions/cache@v3\n    id: cache\n    with:\n      path: path/to/dependencies\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/lockfiles\') }}\n\n  - name: Install Dependencies\n    if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n    run: /install.sh\n```\n\n> **Note** The `id` defined in `actions/cache` must match the `id` in the `if` statement (i.e. `steps.[ID].outputs.cache-hit`)\n\n## Cache Version\n\nCache version is a hash [generated](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/500d0b42fee2552ae9eeb5933091fe2fbf14e72d/packages/cache/src/internal/cacheHttpClient.ts#L73-L90) for a combination of compression tool used (Gzip, Zstd, etc. based on the runner OS) and the `path` of directories being cached. If two caches have different versions, they are identified as unique caches while matching. This, for example, means that a cache created on a `windows-latest` runner can\'t be restored on `ubuntu-latest` as cache `Version`s are different.\n\n> Pro tip: The [list caches](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache#list-github-actions-caches-for-a-repository) API can be used to get the version of a cache. This can be helpful to troubleshoot cache miss due to version.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Example</summary>\nThe workflow will create 3 unique caches with same keys. Ubuntu and windows runners will use different compression technique and hence create two different caches. And `build-linux` will create two different caches as the `paths` are different.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build-linux:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cache Primes\n        id: cache-primes\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: prime-numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes.sh -d prime-numbers\n\n      - name: Cache Numbers\n        id: cache-numbers\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-numbers.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes.sh -d numbers\n\n  build-windows:\n    runs-on: windows-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Cache Primes\n        id: cache-primes\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: prime-numbers\n          key: primes\n\n      - name: Generate Prime Numbers\n        if: steps.cache-primes.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        run: ./generate-primes -d prime-numbers\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Known practices and workarounds\n\nThere are a number of community practices/workarounds to fulfill specific requirements. You may choose to use them if they suit your use case. Note these are not necessarily the only solution or even a recommended solution.\n\n* [Cache segment restore timeout](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cache-segment-restore-timeout)\n* [Update a cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#update-a-cache)\n* [Use cache across feature branches](./tips-and-workarounds.md#use-cache-across-feature-branches)\n* [Cross OS cache](./tips-and-workarounds.md#cross-os-cache)\n* [Force deletion of caches overriding default cache eviction policy](./tips-and-workarounds.md#force-deletion-of-caches-overriding-default-cache-eviction-policy)\n\n### Windows environment variables\n\nPlease note that Windows environment variables (like `%LocalAppData%`) will NOT be expanded by this action. Instead, prefer using `~` in your paths which will expand to the HOME directory. For example, instead of `%LocalAppData%`, use `~\\AppData\\Local`. For a list of supported default environment variables, see the [Learn GitHub Actions: Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) page.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would love for you to contribute to `actions/cache`.

You can learn\nmore about our deprecation plan and the new uploader on our [blog](https://about.codecov.io/blog/introducing-codecovs-new-uploader/).\n\nWe will be restricting any updates to the `v1` Action to security updates and hotfixes.\n\n### Migration from `v1` to `v3`\nThe `v3` uploader has a few breaking changes for users\n- Multiple fields have not been transferred from the bash uploader or have been deprecated. Notably\nmany of the `functionalities` and `gcov_` arguments have been removed. Please check the documentation\nbelow for the full list.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo integrate Codecov with your Actions pipeline, specify the name of this repository with a tag number (`@v3` is recommended) as a `step` within your `workflow.yml` file.\n\nIf you have a *private repository*, this Action also requires you to [provide an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) from [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io) (tip: in order to avoid exposing your token, store it as a `secret`). Optionally, you can choose to include up to four additional inputs to customize the upload context. **For public repositories, no token is needed**\n\nInside your `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@master\n- uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3\n  with:\n    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}\n    files: ./coverage1.xml,./coverage2.xml # optional\n    flags: unittests # optional\n    name: codecov-umbrella # optional\n    fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)\n    verbose: true # optional (default = false)\n```\n>**Note**: This assumes that you've set your Codecov token inside *Settings > Secrets* as `CODECOV_TOKEN`. If not, you can [get an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) for your specific repo on [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io). Keep in mind that secrets are *not* available to forks of repositories.\n\n## Arguments\n\nCodecov's Action supports inputs from the user.

10,"b'# WordPress.org Plugin Deploy\n\n> Deploy your plugin to the WordPress.org repository using GitHub Actions.\n\n[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/blob/develop/LICENSE) [![Automated Tests](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n\nThis Action commits the contents of your Git tag to the WordPress.org plugin repository using the same tag name. It can exclude files as defined in either `.distignore` or `.gitattributes`, and moves anything from a `.wordpress-org` subdirectory to the top-level `assets` directory in Subversion (plugin banners, icons, and screenshots).\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e For updating the readme and items in the assets directory between releases, please see our [WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update)\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Required secrets\n\n* `SVN_USERNAME`\n* `SVN_PASSWORD`\n\n[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.\n\n### Optional environment variables\n\n* `SLUG` - Defaults to the repository name. This is customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.\n* `VERSION` - Defaults to the tag name.  We do not recommend setting this except for testing purposes.\n* `ASSETS_DIR` - Defaults to `.wordpress-org`. This is customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`).\n* `BUILD_DIR` - Defaults to `false`. Set this flag to the directory where you build your plugins files into, then the action will copy and deploy files from that directory. Both absolute and relative paths are supported. The relative path if provided will be concatenated with the repository root directory. All files and folders in the build directory will be deployed, `.disignore` or `.gitattributes` will be ignored.\n\n### Inputs\n\n* `generate-zip` - Defaults to `false`. Generate a ZIP file from the SVN `trunk` directory. Outputs a `zip-path` variable for use in further workflow steps.\n* `dry-run` - Defaults to `false`. Set this to `true` if you want to skip the final Subversion commit step (e.g., to debug prior to a non-dry-run commit).\n\n### Outputs\n\n* `zip-path` - The path to the ZIP file generated if `generate-zip` is set to `true`. Fully qualified including the filename, intended for use in further workflow steps such as uploading release assets.\n\n## Excluding files from deployment\n\nIf there are files or directories to be excluded from deployment, such as tests or editor config files, they can be specified in either a `.distignore` file or a `.gitattributes` file using the `export-ignore` directive. If a `.distignore` file is present, it will be used; if not, the Action will look for a `.gitattributes` file and barring that, will write a basic temporary `.gitattributes` into place before proceeding so that no Git/GitHub-specific files are included.\n\n`.distignore` is useful particularly when there are built files that are in `.gitignore`, and is a file that is used in [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/). For modern plugin setups with a build step and no built files committed to the repository, this is the way forward. `.gitattributes` is useful for plugins that don\'t run a build step as a part of the Actions workflow and also allows for GitHub\'s generated ZIP files to contain the same contents as what is committed to WordPress.org. If you would like to attach a ZIP file with the proper contents that decompresses to a folder name without version number as WordPress generally expects, you can add steps to your workflow that generate the ZIP and attach it to the GitHub release (concrete examples to come).\n\n### Sample baseline files\n\n#### `.distignore`\n\n**Notes:** `.distignore` is for files to be ignored **only**; it does not currently allow negation like `.gitignore`. This comes from its current expected syntax in WP-CLI\'s [`wp dist-archive` command](https://github.com/wp-cli/dist-archive-command/). It is possible that this Action will allow for includes via something like a `.distinclude` file in the future, or that WP-CLI itself makes a change that this Action will reflect for consistency.

11,"b'# WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update\n\n> Deploy readme and asset updates to the WordPress Plugin Repository.\n\n[![Support Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-active-green.svg)](#support-level) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/releases/latest) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update.svg)](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/LICENSE)\n\nThis Action commits any readme and WordPress.org-specific assets changes in your specified branch to the WordPress.org plugin repository if no other changes have been made since the last deployment to WordPress.org. This is useful for updating things like screenshots or `Tested up to` separately from functional changes, provided your Git branching methodology avoids changing anything else in the specified branch between functional releases. It is **highly recommended** that you use a stable branch where you only merge readme/asset commits in between larger functional merges that only occur when preparing for a release (often implemented as `trunk` vs. `develop`).\n\nBecause the WordPress.org plugin repository shows information from the readme in the specified `Stable tag`, this Action also attempts to parse out the stable tag from your readme and deploy to there as well as `trunk`. If your stable tag is `trunk` or a tag that does not exist in the `tags` subfolder, it will skip that part of the update and only update `trunk` and/or `assets`.\n\n**Important note:** If your development process leads to a situation where `trunk` (or other specified branch) only contains changes to the readme or assets directory since the last sync to the plugin directory and those changes are in preparation for the next release, those changes will go live and potentially be misleading to users. Usage of this Action assumes a fairly traditional Git methodology that involves merging all changes to `trunk` when functional changes are ready and that this seemingly unlikely situation will therefore not happen in your repo; there are no safeguards against syncing changes based on readme/asset content, as that cannot be predicted.\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e This Action is meant to be used in tandem with our [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy)\n\n### \xe2\x98\x9e Check out our [collection of WordPress-focused GitHub Actions](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress)\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Required secrets\n\n* `SVN_USERNAME`\n* `SVN_PASSWORD`\n\n[Secrets are set in your repository settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). They cannot be viewed once stored.\n\n### Optional environment variables\n\n* `SLUG` - defaults to the respository name, customizable in case your WordPress repository has a different slug or is capitalized differently.\n* `ASSETS_DIR` - defaults to `.wordpress-org`, customizable for other locations of WordPress.org plugin repository-specific assets that belong in the top-level `assets` directory (the one on the same level as `trunk`). And if you ever want not to update assets and you don\'t have any assets directory, use `SKIP_ASSETS : true`\n* `README_NAME` - defaults to `readme.txt`, customizable in case you use `README.md` instead, which is now quietly supported in the WordPress.org plugin repository.\n* `IGNORE_OTHER_FILES` - defaults to `false`, which means that all your files are copied (as in [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy), respecting `.distignore` and `.gitattributes`), and the Action will bail if anything except assets and `readme.txt` are modified. See ""Important note"" above. If you set this variable to `true`, then only assets and `readme.txt` will be copied, and changes to other files will be ignored and not committed.\n\n## Example Git Workflow\n\nFor this example, Git\'s `main` branch (the default on new repositories) corresponds directly to Subversion\'s `trunk` and is considered the ""release"" branch.\n\nIn general, the expected workflow when using the [WordPress.org Plugin Deploy Action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy) is as follows:\n\n1. Create a new branch for feature x\n2. When the feature is ready for release, merge it onto `main`\n3. On `main`, update the `readme.txt` to reflect the change, e.g.: set the ""Stable tag"", update the changelog, etc. (although some of this could be done on the feature branch prior to merging)\n4. Update any assets in `.wordpress-org`\n5. Tag `main` with the new version number, e.g.: `1.1.0`\n\nAt this point, the [deploy action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy) will push the tag as a Subversion branch to the WordPress svn repository and your new version will be live.\n\nAnd this is where _this_ action comes in\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nAs `main` is our ""release"" branch, changes to anything other than the `readme.txt` and `.wordpress-org` can only be made live by tagging `main`.\n\nIf, however, you need to update the `readme.txt` or assets folder (`.wordpress-org`) for any reason, you should do that directly on `main` and then push your changes. This action will verify that only the `readme.txt` and `.wordpress-org` contain changes and if so, will push them directly to `trunk` on the WordPress svn repository.\n\n## Example Workflow File\n\n```yml\nname: Plugin asset/readme update\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - trunk\njobs:\n  trunk:\n    name: Push to trunk\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - name: WordPress.org plugin asset/readme update\n      uses: 10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update@stable\n      env:\n        SVN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SVN_PASSWORD }}\n        SVN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SVN_USERNAME }}\n```\n\n### Known issues\n\n* It would be more efficient to additionally use the `paths` filter for the `push` action to reduce the number of runs. So far in testing it is possible to limit it to pushes that include readme/asset files as specified, but not ones that *only* include those files. The Action itself still needs to run as written because it compares the totality of changes in the branch against what\'s in SVN and not just the contents of the current push.\n\n## Changelog\n\nA complete listing of all notable changes to WordPress.org Plugin Readme/Assets Update are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWant to help?

12,"b'# Setup Java\n\n[![Basic validation](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml)\n[![Validate Java e2e](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-versions.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-versions.yml)\n[![Validate cache](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-cache.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/actions/workflows/e2e-cache.yml)\n\nThe `setup-java` action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions runners:\n- Downloading and setting up a requested version of Java. See [Usage](#Usage) for a list of supported distributions.\n- Extracting and caching custom version of Java from a local file.\n- Configuring runner for publishing using Apache Maven.\n- Configuring runner for publishing using Gradle.\n- Configuring runner for using GPG private key.\n- Registering problem matchers for error output.\n- Caching dependencies managed by Apache Maven.\n- Caching dependencies managed by Gradle.\n- Caching dependencies managed by sbt.\n- [Maven Toolchains declaration](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) for specified JDK versions.\n\nThis action allows you to work with Java and Scala projects.\n\n## V2 vs V1\n\n- V2 supports custom distributions and provides support for Azul Zulu OpenJDK, Eclipse Temurin and AdoptOpenJDK  out of the box. V1 supports only Azul Zulu OpenJDK.\n- V2 requires you to specify distribution along with the version. V1 defaults to Azul Zulu OpenJDK, only version input is required. Follow [the migration guide](docs/switching-to-v2.md) to switch from V1 to V2.\n\n## Usage\n\n  - `java-version`: The Java version that is going to be set up. Takes a whole or [semver](#supported-version-syntax) Java version. If not specified, the action will expect `java-version-file` input to be specified.\n\n  - `java-version-file`: The path to the `.java-version` file. See more details in [about `.java-version` file](docs/advanced-usage.md#Java-version-file).\n   \n  - `distribution`: _(required)_ Java [distribution](#supported-distributions).\n\n  - `java-package`: The packaging variant of the chosen distribution. Possible values: `jdk`, `jre`, `jdk+fx`, `jre+fx`. Default value: `jdk`.\n\n  - `architecture`: The target architecture of the package. Possible values: `x86`, `x64`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `ppc64le`. Default value: Derived from the runner machine.\n\n  - `jdkFile`: If a use-case requires a custom distribution setup-java uses the compressed JDK from the location pointed by this input and will take care of the installation and caching on the VM.\n\n  - `check-latest`: Setting this option makes the action to check for the latest available version for the version spec.\n\n  - `cache`: Quick [setup caching](#caching-packages-dependencies) for the dependencies managed through one of the predefined package managers. It can be one of ""maven"", ""gradle"" or ""sbt"".\n\n  #### Maven options\n  The action has a bunch of inputs to generate maven\'s [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) on the fly and pass the values to Apache Maven GPG Plugin as well as Apache Maven Toolchains. See [advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) for more.\n\n  - `overwrite-settings`: By default action overwrites the settings.xml. In order to skip generation of file if it exists, set this to `false`.\n\n  - `server-id`: ID of the distributionManagement repository in the pom.xml file. Default is `github`.\n\n  - `server-username`: Environment variable name for the username for authentication to the Apache Maven repository. Default is GITHUB_ACTOR.\n\n  - `server-password`: Environment variable name for password or token for authentication to the Apache Maven repository. Default is GITHUB_TOKEN.\n\n  - `settings-path`: Maven related setting to point to the directory where the settings.xml file will be written. Default is ~/.m2.\n\n  - `gpg-private-key`: GPG private key to import. Default is empty string.\n\n  - `gpg-passphrase`: Environment variable name for the GPG private key passphrase. Default is GPG_PASSPHRASE.\n\n  - `mvn-toolchain-id`: Name of Maven Toolchain ID if the default name of `${distribution}_${java-version}` is not wanted.\n\n  - `mvn-toolchain-vendor`: Name of Maven Toolchain Vendor if the default name of `${distribution}` is not wanted.\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\n#### Eclipse Temurin\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'temurin\' # See \'Supported distributions\' for available options\n    java-version: \'17\'\n- run: java HelloWorldApp.java\n```\n\n#### Azul Zulu OpenJDK\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'zulu\' # See \'Supported distributions\' for available options\n    java-version: \'17\'\n- run: java HelloWorldApp.java\n```\n\n#### Supported version syntax\nThe `java-version` input supports an exact version or a version range using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) notation:\n- major versions: `8`, `11`, `16`, `17`\n- more specific versions: `17.0`, `11.0`, `11.0.4`, `8.0.232`, `8.0.282+8`\n- early access (EA) versions: `15-ea`, `15.0.0-ea`, `15.0.0-ea.2`, `15.0.0+2-ea`\n\n#### Supported distributions\nCurrently, the following distributions are supported:\n| Keyword | Distribution | Official site | License\n|-|-|-|-|\n| `temurin` | Eclipse Temurin | [Link](https://adoptium.net/) | [Link](https://adoptium.net/about.html)\n| `zulu` | Azul Zulu OpenJDK | [Link](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk) | [Link](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-and-zulu-enterprise/zulu-terms-of-use/) |\n| `adopt` or `adopt-hotspot` | AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/about.html) |\n| `adopt-openj9` | AdoptOpenJDK OpenJ9 | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) | [Link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/about.html) |\n| `liberica` | Liberica JDK | [Link](https://bell-sw.com/) | [Link](https://bell-sw.com/liberica_eula/) |\n| `microsoft` | Microsoft Build of OpenJDK | [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) | [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/faq)\n| `corretto` | Amazon Corretto Build of OpenJDK | [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) | [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/faqs/)\n| `semeru` | IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition | [Link](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/) | [Link](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html) |\n| `oracle` | Oracle JDK | [Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) | [Link](https://java.com/freeuselicense)\n\n**NOTE:** The different distributors can provide discrepant list of available versions / supported configurations. Please refer to the official documentation to see the list of supported versions.\n\n**NOTE:** AdoptOpenJDK got moved to Eclipse Temurin and won\'t be updated anymore. It is highly recommended to migrate workflows from `adopt` and `adopt-openj9`, to `temurin` and `semeru` respectively, to keep receiving software and security updates. See more details in the [Good-bye AdoptOpenJDK post](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/08/goodbye-adoptopenjdk-hello-adoptium/).\n\n**NOTE:** For Azul Zulu OpenJDK architectures x64 and arm64 are mapped to x86 / arm with proper hw_bitness.\n\n### Caching packages dependencies\nThe action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under hood for caching dependencies but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are gradle, maven and sbt. The format of the used cache key is `setup-java-${{ platform }}-${{ packageManager }}-${{ fileHash }}`, where the hash is based on the following files:\n- gradle: `**/*.gradle*`, `**/gradle-wrapper.properties`, `buildSrc/**/Versions.kt`, `buildSrc/**/Dependencies.kt`, `gradle/*.versions.toml`, and `**/versions.properties`\n- maven: `**/pom.xml`\n- sbt: all sbt build definition files `**/*.sbt`, `**/project/build.properties`, `**/project/**.scala`, `**/project/**.sbt`\n\nThe workflow output `cache-hit` is set to indicate if an exact match was found for the key [as actions/cache does](https://github.com/actions/cache/tree/main#outputs).\n\nThe cache input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.\n\n#### Caching gradle dependencies\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'temurin\'\n    java-version: \'17\'\n    cache: \'gradle\'\n- run: ./gradlew build --no-daemon\n```\n\n#### Caching maven dependencies\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'temurin\'\n    java-version: \'17\'\n    cache: \'maven\'\n- name: Build with Maven\n  run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml\n```\n\n#### Caching sbt dependencies\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'temurin\'\n    java-version: \'17\'\n    cache: \'sbt\'\n- name: Build with SBT\n  run: sbt package\n```\n\n### Check latest\n\nIn the basic examples above, the `check-latest` flag defaults to `false`. When set to `false`, the action tries to first resolve a version of Java from the local tool cache on the runner. If unable to find a specific version in the cache, the action will download a version of Java. Use the default or set `check-latest` to `false` if you prefer a faster more consistent setup experience that prioritizes trying to use the cached versions at the expense of newer versions sometimes being available for download.\n\nIf `check-latest` is set to `true`, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally cached version is not the most up-to-date, the latest version of Java will be downloaded. Set `check-latest` to `true` if you want the most up-to-date version of Java to always be used. Setting `check-latest` to `true` has performance implications as downloading versions of Java is slower than using cached versions.\n\nFor Java distributions that are not cached on Hosted images, `check-latest` always behaves as `true` and downloads Java on-flight. Check out [Hosted Tool Cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#Hosted-Tool-Cache) for more details about pre-cached Java versions.\n\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n  with:\n    distribution: \'temurin\'\n    java-version: \'17\'\n    check-latest: true\n- run: java HelloWorldApp.java\n```\n\n### Testing against different Java versions\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        java: [ \'8\', \'11\', \'17\' ]\n    name: Java ${{ matrix.Java }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Setup java\n        uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n        with:\n          distribution: \'<distribution>\'\n          java-version: ${{ matrix.java }}\n      - run: java HelloWorldApp.java\n```\n\n### Install multiple JDKs\n\nAll versions are added to the PATH. The last version will be used and available globally. Other Java versions can be accessed through env variables with such specification as \'JAVA_HOME_{{ MAJOR_VERSION }}_{{ ARCHITECTURE }}\'.\n\n```yaml\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n        with:\n          distribution: \'<distribution>\'\n          java-version: |\n            8\n            11\n            15\n```\n\n### Using Maven Toolchains\nIn the example above multiple JDKs are installed for the same job. The result after the last JDK is installed is a Maven Toolchains declaration containing references to all three JDKs. The values for `id`, `version`, and `vendor` of the individual Toolchain entries are the given input values for `distribution` and `java-version` (`vendor` being the combination of `${distribution}_${java-version}`) by default.\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n- [Selecting a Java distribution](docs/advanced-usage.md#Selecting-a-Java-distribution)\n  - [Eclipse Temurin](docs/advanced-usage.md#Eclipse-Temurin)\n  - [Adopt](docs/advanced-usage.md#Adopt)\n  - [Zulu](docs/advanced-usage.md#Zulu)\n  - [Liberica](docs/advanced-usage.md#Liberica)\n  - [Microsoft](docs/advanced-usage.md#Microsoft)\n  - [Amazon Corretto](docs/advanced-usage.md#Amazon-Corretto)\n  - [Oracle](docs/advanced-usage.md#Oracle)\n- [Installing custom Java package type](docs/advanced-usage.md#Installing-custom-Java-package-type)\n- [Installing custom Java architecture](docs/advanced-usage.md#Installing-custom-Java-architecture)\n- [Installing custom Java distribution from local file](docs/advanced-usage.md#Installing-Java-from-local-file)\n- [Testing against different Java distributions](docs/advanced-usage.md#Testing-against-different-Java-distributions)\n- [Testing against different platforms](docs/advanced-usage.md#Testing-against-different-platforms)\n- [Publishing using Apache Maven](docs/advanced-usage.md#Publishing-using-Apache-Maven)\n- [Publishing using Gradle](docs/advanced-usage.md#Publishing-using-Gradle)\n- [Hosted Tool Cache](docs/advanced-usage.md#Hosted-Tool-Cache)\n- [Modifying Maven Toolchains](docs/advanced-usage.md#Modifying-Maven-Toolchains)\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

13,"b'# Execute Gradle builds in GitHub Actions workflows\n\nThis GitHub Action can be used to configure Gradle and optionally execute a Gradle build on any platform supported by GitHub Actions.\n\n## Use the action to setup Gradle\n\nIf you have an existing workflow invoking Gradle, you can add an initial ""Setup Gradle"" Step to benefit from caching, \nbuild-scan capture and other features of the gradle-build-action.\n\nAll subsequent Gradle invocations will benefit from this initial setup, via `init` scripts added to the Gradle User Home.\n\n```yaml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n        \n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    \n    - name: Execute Gradle build\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\n## Why use the `gradle-build-action`?\n\nIt is possible to directly invoke Gradle in your workflow, and the `actions/setup-java@v3` action provides a simple way to cache Gradle dependencies. \n\nHowever, the `gradle-build-action` offers a number of advantages over this approach:\n\n- Easily [run the build with different versions of Gradle](#use-a-specific-gradle-version) using the `gradle-version` parameter. Gradle distributions are automatically downloaded and cached. \n- More sophisticated and more efficient caching of Gradle User Home between invocations, compared to `setup-java` and most custom configurations using `actions/cache`. [More details below](#caching).\n- Detailed reporting of cache usage and cache configuration options allow you to [optimize the use of the GitHub actions cache](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness).\n- [Automatic capture of Build Scan\xc2\xae links](#build-scans) from the build, making these easier to locate for workflow run.\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` is designed to provide these benefits with minimal configuration. \nThese features work both when Gradle is executed via the `gradle-build-action` and for any Gradle execution in subsequent steps.\n\nWhen using `gradle-build-action` we recommend that you _not_ use `actions/cache` or `actions/setup-java@v3` to explicitly cache the Gradle User Home. Doing so may interfere with the caching provided by this action.\n\n## Use a specific Gradle version\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` can download and install a specified Gradle version, adding this installed version to the PATH.\nDownloaded Gradle versions are stored in the GitHub Actions cache, to avoid requiring downloading again later.\n\n```yaml\n - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n   with:\n     gradle-version: 6.5\n```\n\nThe `gradle-version` parameter can be set to any valid Gradle version.\n\nMoreover, you can use the following aliases:\n\n| Alias | Selects |\n| --- |---|\n| `wrapper`           | The Gradle wrapper\'s version (default, useful for matrix builds) |\n| `current`           | The current [stable release](https://gradle.org/install/) |\n| `release-candidate` | The current [release candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate/) if any, otherwise fallback to `current` |\n| `nightly`           | The latest [nightly](https://gradle.org/nightly/), fails if none. |\n| `release-nightly`   | The latest [release nightly](https://gradle.org/release-nightly/), fails if none.      |\n\nThis can be handy to automatically verify your build works with the latest release candidate of Gradle:\n\n```yaml\nname: Test latest Gradle RC\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: 0 0 * * * # daily\njobs:\n  gradle-rc:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n    - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        gradle-version: release-candidate\n    - run: gradle build --dry-run # just test build configuration\n```\n\n## Gradle Execution\n\nIf the action is configured with an `arguments` input, then Gradle will execute a Gradle build with the arguments provided.\n\nIf no `arguments` are provided, the action will not execute Gradle, but will still cache Gradle state and configure build-scan capture for all subsequent Gradle executions.\n\n```yaml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3\n      with:\n        distribution: temurin\n        java-version: 11\n    \n    - name: Setup and execute Gradle \'test\' task\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        arguments: test\n```\n\n### Multiple Gradle executions in the same Job\n\nIt is possible to configure multiple Gradle executions to run sequentially in the same job. \nThe initial Action step will perform the Gradle setup.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: assemble\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: check\n```\n\n### Gradle command-line arguments\n\nThe `arguments` input can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to the `gradle` command line.\nArguments can be supplied in a single line, or as a multi-line input.\n\nHere are some valid examples:\n```yaml\narguments: build\narguments: check --scan\narguments: some arbitrary tasks\narguments: build -PgradleProperty=foo\narguments: |\n    build\n    --scan\n    -PgradleProperty=foo\n    -DsystemProperty=bar\n```\n\nIf you need to pass environment variables, use the GitHub Actions workflow syntax:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  env:\n    CI: true\n  with:\n    arguments: build\n```\n\n### Gradle build located in a subdirectory\n\nBy default, the action will execute Gradle in the root directory of your project. \nUse the `build-root-directory` input to target a Gradle build in a subdirectory.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n  with:\n    arguments: build\n    build-root-directory: some/subdirectory\n```\n\n### Using a specific Gradle executable\n\nThe action will first look for a Gradle wrapper script in the root directory of your project. \nIf not found, `gradle` will be executed from the PATH.\nUse the `gradle-executable` input to execute using a specific Gradle installation.\n\n```yaml\n - uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n   with:\n     arguments: build\n     gradle-executable: /path/to/installed/gradle\n```\n\nThis mechanism can also be used to target a Gradle wrapper script that is located in a non-default location.\n\n## Caching\n\nBy default, this action aims to cache any and all reusable state that may be speed up a subsequent build invocation. \n\nThe state that is cached includes:\n- Any distributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter ;\n- A subset of the Gradle User Home directory, including downloaded dependencies, wrapper distributions, and the local build cache ;\n\nTo reduce the space required for caching, this action makes a best effort to reduce duplication in cache entries.\n\nCaching is enabled by default. You can disable caching for the action as follows:\n```yaml\ncache-disabled: true\n```\n### Cache keys\n\nDistributions downloaded to satisfy a `gradle-version` parameter are stored outside of Gradle User Home and cached separately. The cache key is unique to the downloaded distribution and will not change over time.\n\nThe state of the Gradle User Home is highly dependent on the Gradle execution, so the cache key is composed of the current commit hash and the GitHub actions job id.\nAs such, the cache key is likely to change on each subsequent run of GitHub actions. \nThis allows the most recent state to always be available in the GitHub actions cache.\n\nTo reduce duplication between cache entries, certain artifacts are cached independently based on their identity.\nArtifacts that are cached independently include downloaded dependencies, downloaded wrapper distributions and generated Gradle API jars.\nFor example, this means that all jobs executing a particular version of the Gradle wrapper will share common entries for wrapper distributions and for generated Gradle API jars.\n\n### Using the caches read-only\n\nBy default, the `gradle-build-action` will only write to the cache from Jobs on the default (`main`/`master`) branch.\nJobs on other branches will read entries from the cache but will not write updated entries. \nSee [Optimizing cache effectiveness](#optimizing-cache-effectiveness) for a more detailed explanation.\n\nIn some circumstances it makes sense to change this default, and to configure a workflow Job to read existing cache entries but not to write changes back.\n\nYou can configure read-only caching for the `gradle-build-action` as follows:\n\n```yaml\n# Only write to the cache for builds on the \'main\' and \'release\' branches. (Default is \'main\' only.)\n# Builds on other branches will only read existing entries from the cache.\ncache-read-only: ${{ github.ref != \'refs/heads/main\' && github.ref != \'refs/heads/release\' }}\n```\n\n### Stopping the Gradle daemon\n\nBy default, the action will stop all running Gradle daemons in the post-action step, prior to saving the Gradle User Home state. \nThis allows for any Gradle User Home cleanup to occur, and avoid file-locking issues on Windows.\n\nIf caching is unavailable or the cache is in read-only mode, the daemon will not be stopped and will continue running after the job is completed.\n\n### Gradle User Home cache tuning\n\nAs well as any wrapper distributions, the action will attempt to save and restore the `caches` and `notifications` directories from Gradle User Home.\n\nThe contents to be cached can be fine tuned by including and excluding certain paths with Gradle User Home.\n\n```yaml\n# Cache downloaded JDKs in addition to the default directories.\ngradle-home-cache-includes: |\n    caches\n    notifications\n    jdks\n# Exclude the local build-cache and keyrings from the directories cached.\ngradle-home-cache-excludes: |\n    caches/build-cache-1\n    caches/keyrings\n```\n\nYou can specify any number of fixed paths or patterns to include or exclude. \nFile pattern support is documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#patterns-to-match-file-paths.\n\n### Cache debugging and analysis\n\nGradle User Home state will be restored from the cache during the first `gradle-build-action` step for any workflow job. \nThis state will be saved back to the cache at the end of the job, after all Gradle executions have completed.\nA report of all cache entries restored and saved is printed to the Job Summary when saving the cache entries. \nThis report can provide valuable insignt into how much cache space is being used.\n\nIt is possible to enable additional debug logging for cache operations. You do via the `GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED` environment variable:\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  GRADLE_BUILD_ACTION_CACHE_DEBUG_ENABLED: true\n```\n\nNote that this setting will also prevent certain cache operations from running in parallel, further assisting with debugging.\n\n### Optimizing cache effectiveness\n\nCache storage space for GitHub actions is limited, and writing new cache entries can trigger the deletion of existing entries.\nEviction of shared cache entries can reduce cache effectiveness, slowing down your `gradle-build-action` steps.\n\nThere are a number of actions you can take if your cache use is less effective due to entry eviction.\n\n#### Select branches that should write to the cache\n\nGitHub cache entries are not shared between builds on different branches. \nThis means that each PR branch will have it\'s own Gradle User Home cache, and will not benefit from cache entries written by other PR branches.\nAn exception to this is that cache entries written in parent and upstream branches are visible to child branches, and cache entries for the default (`master`/`main`) branch can be read by actions invoked for any other branch.\n\nBy default, the `gradle-build-action` will only _write_ to the cache for builds run on the default (`master`/`main`) branch. \nJobs run on other branches will only read from the cache. In most cases, this is the desired behaviour, \nbecause Jobs run against other branches will benefit from the cache Gradle User Home from `main`, \nwithout writing private cache entries that could lead to evicting shared entries.\n\nIf you have other long-lived development branches that would benefit from writing to the cache, \nyou can configure these by overriding the `cache-read-only` action parameter. \nSee [Using the caches read-only](#using-the-caches-read-only) for more details.\n\nSimilarly, you could use `cache-read-only` for certain jobs in the workflow, and instead have these jobs reuse the cache content from upstream jobs.\n\n#### Exclude content from Gradle User Home cache\n\nEach build is different, and some builds produce more Gradle User Home content than others.\n[Cache debugging ](#cache-debugging-and-analysis) can provide insight into which cache entries are the largest,\nand you can selectively [exclude content using `gradle-home-cache-exclude`](#gradle-user-home-cache-tuning).\n\n#### Removing unused files from Gradle User Home before saving to cache\n\nThe Gradle User Home directory has a tendency to grow over time. When you switch to a new Gradle wrapper version or upgrade a dependency version\nthe old files are not automatically and immediately removed. While this can make sense in a local environment, in a GitHub Actions environment\nit can lead to ever-larger Gradle User Home cache entries being saved and restored.\n\nIn order to avoid this situation, the `gradle-build-action` supports the `gradle-home-cache-cleanup` parameter. \nWhen enabled, this feature will attempt to delete any files in the Gradle User Home that were not used by Gradle during the GitHub Actions workflow, \nprior to saving the Gradle User Home to the GitHub Actions cache.\n\nGradle Home cache cleanup is disabled by default.  You can enable this feature for the action as follows:\n```yaml\ngradle-home-cache-cleanup: true\n```\n\n## Build reporting\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` collects information about any Gradle executions that occur in a workflow, and reports these via\na Job Summary, visible in the GitHub Actions UI. For each Gradle execution, details about the invocation are listed, together with\na link to any Build Scan\xc2\xae published.\n\nGeneration of a Job Summary is enabled by default. If this is not desired, it can be disable as follows:\n```yaml\ngenerate-job-summary: false\n```\n\nNote that the action collects information about Gradle invocations via an [Initialization Script](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html#sec:using_an_init_script)\nlocated at `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/build-result-capture.init.gradle`.\nIf you are using init scripts for the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise) like\n[`scans-init.gradle` or `gradle-enterprise-init.gradle`](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#scans_gradle_com),\nyou\'ll need to ensure these files are applied prior to `build-result-capture.init.gradle`.\nSince Gradle applies init scripts in alphabetical order, one way to ensure this is via file naming.\n\n### Build Scan\xc2\xae link as Step output\n\nAs well as reporting the [Build Scan](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) link in the Job Summary,\nthe `gradle-build-action` action makes this link available as a Step output named `build-scan-url`.\n\nYou can then use that link in subsequent actions of your workflow. For example:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/gradle-build-pr.yml\nname: Run Gradle on PRs\non: pull_request\njobs:\n  gradle:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout project sources\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    - name: Run build with Gradle wrapper\n      id: gradle\n      run: ./gradlew build --scan\n    - name: ""Add Build Scan URL as PR comment""\n      uses: actions/github-script@v5\n      if: github.event_name == \'pull_request\' && failure()\n      with:\n        github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n        script: |\n          github.rest.issues.createComment({\n            issue_number: context.issue.number,\n            owner: context.repo.owner,\n            repo: context.repo.repo,\n            body: \'\xe2\x9d\x8c ${{ github.workflow }} failed: ${{ steps.gradle.outputs.build-scan-url }}\'\n          })\n```\n\n### Saving build outputs\n\nBy default, a GitHub Actions workflow using `gradle-build-action` will record the log output and any Build Scan links for your build,\nbut any output files generated by the build will not be saved.\n\nTo save selected files from your build execution, you can use the core [Upload-Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\njobs:   \n  gradle:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout project sources\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n    - name: Run build with Gradle wrapper\n      run: ./gradlew build --scan\n    - name: Upload build reports\n      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: build-reports\n        path: build/reports/\n```\n\n## Support for GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)\n\nYou can use the `gradle-build-action` on GitHub Enterprise Server, and benefit from the improved integration with Gradle. Depending on the version of GHES you are running, certain features may be limited:\n- Build Scan links are captured and displayed in the GitHub Actions UI\n- Easily run your build with different versions of Gradle\n- Save/restore of Gradle User Home (requires GHES v3.5+ : GitHub Actions cache was introduced in GHES 3.5)\n- Support for GitHub Actions Job Summary (requires GHES 3.6+ : GitHub Actions Job Summary support was introduced in GHES 3.6). In earlier versions of GHES the build-results summary and caching report will be written to the workflow log, as part of the post-action step.\n\n# GitHub Dependency Graph support\n\nThe `gradle-build-action` has experimental support for submitting a [GitHub Dependency Graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph) snapshot via the [GitHub Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-submission?apiVersion=2022-11-28).\n\nThe dependency graph snapshot is generated via integration with the [GitHub Dependency Graph Gradle Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.github-dependency-graph-gradle-plugin), and saved as a workflow artifact. The generated snapshot files can be submitted either in the same job, or in a subsequent job (in the same or a dependent workflow).\n\nThe generated dependency graph snapshot reports all of the dependencies that were resolved during a bulid execution, and is used by GitHub to generate [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) for vulnerable dependencies, as well as to populate the [Dependency Graph insights view](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph).\n \nYou enable GitHub Dependency Graph support by setting the `dependency-graph` action parameter. Valid values are:\n\n|<div style=""width:290px"">Option</div> | Behaviour |\n| --- |---|\n| `disabled`           | Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations.<p>This is the default. |\n| `generate`           | Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact. |\n| `generate-and-submit` | As per `generate`, but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job. |\n| `download-and-submit` | Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step. |\n\n- \'disabled\': Do not generate a dependency graph for any build invocations. This is the default.\n- \'generate\': Generate a dependency graph snapshot for each build invocation, saving as a workflow artifact.\n- \'generate-and-submit\': As per \'generate\', but any generated dependency graph snapshots will be submitted at the end of the job.\n- \'download-and-submit\': Download any previously saved dependency graph snapshots, submitting them via the Dependency Submission API. This can be useful to collect all snapshots in a matrix of builds and submit them in one step.\n\nDependency Graph _submission_ (but not generation) requires the `contents: write` permission, which may need to be explicitly enabled in the workflow file.\n\nExample of a simple workflow that generates and submits a dependency graph:\n```yaml\nname: Submit dependency graph\non:\n  push:\n  \npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph snapshot which will be submitted\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\n### Filtering which Gradle Configurations contribute to the dependency graph\n\nIf you do not want to include every dependency configuration in every project in your build, you can limit the\ndependency extraction to a subset of these.\n\nTo restrict which Gradle subprojects contribute to the report, specify which projects to include via a regular expression.\nYou can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_PROJECTS` environment variable or system property.\n\nTo restrict which Gradle configurations contribute to the report, you can filter configurations by name using a regular expression.\nYou can provide this value via the `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS` environment variable or system property.\n\nExample of a simple workflow that limits the dependency graph to `RuntimeClasspath` configuration:\n```yaml\nname: Submit dependency graph\non:\n  push:\n  \npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate-and-submit\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph from \'RuntimeClasspath\' configurations\n      run: ./gradlew build -DDEPENDENCY_GRAPH_INCLUDE_CONFIGURATIONS=RuntimeClasspath\n```\n\n### Gradle version compatibility\n\nThe plugin should be compatible with all versions of Gradle >= 5.0, and has been tested against \nGradle versions ""5.6.4"", ""6.9.4"", ""7.0.2"", ""7.6.2"", ""8.0.2"" and the current Gradle release.\n\nThe plugin is compatible with running Gradle with the configuration-cache enabled. However, this support is\nlimited to Gradle ""8.1.0"" and later:\n- With Gradle ""8.0"", the build should run successfully, but an empty dependency graph will be generated.\n- With Gradle <= ""7.6.4"", the plugin will cause the build to fail with configuration-cache enabled.\n\nTo use this plugin with versions of Gradle older than ""8.1.0"", you\'ll need to invoke Gradle with the\nconfiguration-cache disabled.\n\n### Dependency snapshots generated for pull requests\n\nThis `contents: write` permission is not available for any workflow that is triggered by a pull request submitted from a forked repository, since it would permit a malicious pull request to make repository changes. \n\nBecause of this restriction, it is not possible to `generate-and-submit` a dependency graph generated for a pull-request that comes from a repository fork. In order to do so, 2 workflows will be required:\n1. The first workflow runs directly against the pull request sources and will generate the dependency graph snapshot.\n2. The second workflow is triggered on `workflow_run` of the first workflow, and will submit the previously saved dependency snapshots.\n\nNote: when `download-and-submit` is used in a workflow triggered via [workflow_run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run), the action will download snapshots saved in the triggering workflow.\n\n***Main workflow file***\n```yaml\nname: run-build-and-generate-dependency-snapshot\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup Gradle to generate and submit dependency graphs\n      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: generate # Only generate in this job\n    - name: Run a build, generating the dependency graph snapshot which will be submitted\n      run: ./gradlew build\n```\n\n***Dependent workflow file***\n```yaml\nname: submit-dependency-snapshot\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\'run-build-and-generate-dependency-snapshot\']\n    types: [completed]\n\njobs:\n  submit-snapshots:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Retrieve dependency graph artifact and submit\n        uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n      with:\n        dependency-graph: download-and-submit\n```\n\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
14,"b'# microsoft/setup-msbuild\r\nThis action will help discover where the `MSBuild` tool is and automatically add it to the `PATH` environment variables for you so future steps in your Actions workflow can just initiate `msbuild` commands without knowing the full path.\r\n\r\n> Please note this tool does NOT add other Visual Studio tools (like VSTest, cl, cmake, or others) to `PATH`\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Add msbuild to PATH\r\n  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.1\r\n\r\n- name: Build app for release\r\n  run: msbuild src\\YourProjectFile.csproj -t:rebuild -verbosity:diag -property:Configuration=Release\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optional Parameters\r\nThere are a few additional parameters that can be set if you need them. These are optional and should only be set if you know that you need them or what you are doing.\r\n\r\n### Specifying specific versions of Visual Studio (optional)\r\nYou may have a situation where your Actions runner has multiple versions of Visual Studio and you need to find a specific version of the tool.  Simply add the `vs-version` input to specify the range of versions to find.  If looking for a specific version, specify the minimum and maximum versions as shown in the example below, which will look for just 16.4.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Add msbuild to PATH\r\n  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.1\r\n  with:\r\n    vs-version: \'[16.4,16.5)\'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax is the same used for Visual Studio extensions, where square brackets like ""["" mean inclusive, and parenthesis like ""("" mean exclusive. A comma is always required, but eliding the minimum version looks for all older versions and eliding the maximum version looks for all newer versions. See the [vswhere wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere/wiki) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Use pre-release versions of Visual Studio (optional)\r\nIf you need your Actions runner to target a pre-release version of Visual Studio, simply add the `vs-prerelease` input.  This is necessary if you want to run an action on a virtual environment that contains a pre-release version of Visual Studio or self-hosted images that you may have that also have pre-release versions of Visual Studio installed.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Add msbuild to PATH\r\n  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.1\r\n  with:\r\n    vs-prerelease: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specifying MSBuild architecture (optional)\r\nBy default the action will use the x86 architecture for MSBuild, but it is possible to target the x64 versions instead. Simply add the `msbuild-architecture` input. Valid input values are `x86` (default), `x64`, and `arm64`. Note that the success of these will rely on the runner OS.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Add msbuild to PATH\r\n  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.1\r\n  with:\r\n    msbuild-architecture: x64\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How does this work?\r\nThis makes use of the vswhere tool which is a tool delivered by Microsoft to help in identifying Visual Studio installs and various components.  This tool is installed on the hosted Windows runners for GitHub Actions.  If you are using a self-hosted runner, you either need to make sure vswhere.exe is in your agent\'s PATH or specify a full path to the location using:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Add msbuild to PATH\r\n  uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.1\r\n  with:\r\n    vswhere-path: \'C:\\path\\to\\your\\tools\\\'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes on arguments\r\nWhile the Action enables you to specify a `vswhere` path as well as a `vs-version`, these are more advanced options and when using GitHub-hosted runners you should not need these and is recommended you don\'t specify them as they are optional.  Using these require you to fully understand the runner environment, updates to the tools on the runner, and can cause failures if you are out of sync.  For GitHub-hosted runners, omitting these arguments is the preferred usage.\r\n\r\n## Building this repo\r\nAs with most GitHub Actions, this requires NodeJS development tools.  After installing NodeJS, you can build this by executing:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run build\r\nnpm run pack\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will modify/create the /dist folder with the final index.js output\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\nThank you to [Warren Buckley](https://github.com/warrenbuckley) for being a core contributor to this Action for the benefit of all developers!\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

16,"b'# setup-ruby\n\nThis action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.\n\nIt is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.\nNo extra packages need to be installed.\n\n**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.\nIf you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit\nwill be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).\n\n### Supported Versions\n\nThis action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:\n\n| Interpreter | Versions |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| `ruby` | 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.9, 2.2, all versions from 2.3.0 until 3.3.0-preview1, head, debug, mingw, mswin, ucrt |\n| `jruby` | 9.1.17.0 - 9.4.3.0, head |\n| `truffleruby` | 19.3.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n| `truffleruby+graalvm` | 21.2.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n\n`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  \n\nRegarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64\nbuilds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.\n\nPreview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).\nHowever, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,\nas it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.\n\nOnly release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)\nare available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10\non other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.\n\nNote that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,\nwhich means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.\n\n| Operating System | Supported |\n| ---------------- | --------- |\n| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |\n| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |\n| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |\n\nThe prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)\nand on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).\nThe `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).\n`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),\n`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),\n`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)\nand `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).\nThe full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)\nfor Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Single Job\n\n```yaml\nname: My workflow\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    -

uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n```\n\nNote that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.\n\nThis caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  \nIt needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  \nIf there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.\n\nTo use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level\nas shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\n\n#### bundle config\n\nWhen using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.\nThese can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.\nThey should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\nTo find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.\nYou might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.\n\nTo perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  \nTherefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).\n\n#### How it Works\n\nWhen there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.\nIn other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.\nThe hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.\n\n#### Dealing with a corrupted cache\n\nIn some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system\nat the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.\nIn order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value\nif you have already used it before.)\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n        cache-version: 1\n```\n\n#### Caching `bundle install` manually\n\nIt is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.\nThere are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).\nSo, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.\n\n## Windows\n\nNote that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.\nIt is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.\n\n* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.\n* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).\n* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.\n* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.\n* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.\n* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).\n* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).\n\n## Versioning\n\nIt is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.\nThis will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.\n\nIf you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and\nit will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.\nMake sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.\n\nThis action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.\nThis follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.\n\n## Using self-hosted runners\n\nThis action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)\nif the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:\n\n* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.\n* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.\n* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed\n* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,\n  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.\n  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.\n* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.\n\nIn other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case\n(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).\nYou could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.\n\n## History\n\nThis action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.\nPlease [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe current maintainer of this action is @eregon.\nMost of the Windows logic is based on work by MSP-Greg.\nMany thanks to MSP-Greg and Lars Kanis for the help with Ruby Installer.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

See [nightly build setup](#nightly-build-setup) for more information.\n- To use JIT on `PHP 8.0` and above, refer to the [JIT configuration](#jit-configuration) section.\n\n## :heavy_plus_sign: PHP Extension Support\n\nPHP extensions can be set up using the `extensions` input. It accepts a `string` in csv-format.\n\n- On `Ubuntu`, extensions which are available as a package, available on `PECL` or a git repository can be set up.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with PECL extension\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: imagick, swoole\n```\n\n- On `Windows`, extensions available on `PECL` which have the `DLL` binary can be set up.\n\n- On `macOS`, extensions available on `PECL` or a git repository can be set up.\n\n- On `Ubuntu` and `macOS` to compile and install an extension from a git repository follow this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Add-extension-from-source ""Guide to compile and install PHP extensions in setup-php"").\n\n- Extensions installed along with PHP if specified are enabled.\n\n- Specific versions of extensions available on `PECL` can be set up by suffixing the extension\'s name with the version. This is useful for installing old versions of extensions which support end of life PHP versions.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with specific version of PECL extension\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'5.4\'\n    extensions: swoole-1.9.3\n```\n\n- Extensions with pre-release versions available on `PECL` can be set up by suffixing the extension\'s name with its state i.e `alpha`, `beta`, `devel` or `snapshot`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with pre-release PECL extension\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: xdebug-beta\n```\n\n- On `Ubuntu` and `macOS` to compile and install an extension from PECL with libraries or custom configuration follow this [guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Add-extension-from-PECL-with-libraries-and-custom-configuration ""Guide to compile and install PHP extensions using PECL with libraries and custom configuration in setup-php"").\n\n- Shared extensions can be disabled by prefixing them with a `:`. All extensions depending on the specified extension will also be disabled.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP and disable opcache\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: :opcache\n```\n\n- All shared extensions can be disabled by specifying `none`. When `none` is specified along with other extensions, it is hoisted to the start of the input. So, all the shared extensions will be disabled first, then rest of the extensions in the input will be processed.\n\n**Note:** This disables all core and third-party shared extensions and thus, can break some tools which need them. Required extensions are enabled again when the tools are set up on a best-effort basis. So it is recommended to add the extensions required for your tools after `none` in the `extensions` input to avoid any issues.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP without any shared extensions except mbstring\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: none, mbstring\n```\n\n- Extension `intl` can be set up with specific `ICU` version for `PHP 5.6` and above in `Ubuntu` workflows by suffixing `intl` with the `ICU` version. `ICU 50.2` and newer versions are supported. Refer to [`ICU builds`](https://github.com/shivammathur/icu-intl#icu4c-builds) for the specific versions supported.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with intl\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: intl-70.1\n```\n\n- Extensions loaded by default after `setup-php` runs can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki).\n\n- These extensions have custom support:\n  - `cubrid` and `pdo_cubrid` on `Ubuntu`.\n  - `event`, `gearman`, `geos` and `relay` on `Ubuntu` and `macOS`.\n  - `blackfire`, `couchbase`, `ioncube`, `oci8`, `pdo_firebird`, `pdo_oci`, `pecl_http`, `phalcon3`, `phalcon4`, `phalcon5`, and `zephir_parser` on all supported OS.\n\n- By default, extensions which cannot be added or disabled gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the execution is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set `fail-fast` flag to `true`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with fail-fast\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: oci8\n  env:\n    fail-fast: true\n```\n\n## :wrench: Tools Support\n\nThese tools can be set up globally using the `tools` input. It accepts a string in csv-format.\n\n[`behat`], [`blackfire`], [`blackfire-player`], [`castor`], [`churn`], [`codeception`], [`composer`], [`composer-normalize`], [`composer-prefetcher`], [`composer-require-checker`], [`composer-unused`], [`cs2pr`], [`deployer`], [`flex`], [`grpc_php_plugin`], [`infection`], [`parallel-lint`], [`pecl`], [`phan`], [`phing`], [`phinx`], [`phive`], [`php-config`], [`php-cs-fixer`], [`phpcbf`], [`phpcpd`], [`phpcs`], [`phpdoc`] or [`phpDocumentor`], [`phpize`], [`phplint`], [`phpmd`], [`phpspec`], [`phpstan`], [`phpunit`], [`phpunit-bridge`], [`phpunit-polyfills`], [`pint`], [`prestissimo`], [`protoc`], [`psalm`], [`rector`], [`symfony`] or [`symfony-cli`], [`vapor`] or [`vapor-cli`], [`wp`] or [`wp-cli`]\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with tools\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit\n```\n\n- In addition to above tools any composer tool or package can also be set up globally by specifying it as `vendor/package` matching the listing on Packagist. This format accepts the same [version constraints](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#writing-version-constraints ""Composer version constraints"") as `composer`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with tools\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: vimeo/psalm\n```\n\n- To set up a particular version of a tool, specify it in the form `tool:version`.\n  \n  Version can be in the following format:\n    - Semver. For example `tool:1.2.3` or `tool:1.2.3-beta1`.\n    - Major version. For example `tool:1` or `tool:1.x`.\n    - Major and minor version. For example `tool:1.2` or `tool:1.2.x`.\n  \n  When you specify just the major version or the version in `major.minor` format, the latest patch version matching the input will be setup. \n\n  With the exception of major versions of `composer`, if you specify only the `major` version or the version in `major.minor` format for a tool you can get rate limited by GitHub\'s API. To avoid this, it is recommended to provide a [`GitHub` OAuth token](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php#composer-github-oauth ""Composer GitHub OAuth"").\n  You can do that by setting `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. The `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `GITHUB_TOKEN` and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with tools\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: php-cs-fixer:3.5, phpunit:9.5\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n- The latest stable version of `composer` is set up by default. You can set up the required `composer` version by specifying the major version `v1` or `v2`, or the version in `major.minor` or `semver` format. Additionally, for composer `snapshot` and `preview` can also be specified to set up the respective releases.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with composer v2\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: composer:v2\n```\n\n- If you do not use composer in your workflow, you can specify `tools: none` to skip it.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP without composer\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: none\n```\n\n- Tools `pear`, `pecl`, `phpize` and `php-config` are set up by default for all supported PHP versions on Linux and macOS.\n\n- The latest version of `blackfire` cli is set up when `blackfire` is specified in tools input. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/ci/github-actions ""Blackfire.io documentation for GitHub Actions"") for using `blackfire` with GitHub Actions.\n\n- Tools `prestissimo` and `composer-prefetcher` will be skipped unless `composer:v1` is also specified in tools input. It is recommended to drop `prestissimo` and use `composer v2`.\n\n- By default, except `composer` tools which cannot be set up gracefully leave an error message in the logs, the execution is not interrupted. To change this behaviour you can set `fail-fast` flag to `true`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with fail-fast\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: deployer\n  env:\n    fail-fast: true\n```\n\n**Notes**\n- Input `tools` is useful to set up tools which are only used in CI workflows, thus keeping your `composer.json` tidy.\n- If you do not want to use all your dev-dependencies in workflow, you can run composer with `--no-dev` and install required tools using `tools` input to speed up your workflow.\n- By default, `COMPOSER_NO_INTERACTION` is set to `1` and `COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT` is set to `0`. In effect, this means that Composer commands in your scripts do not need to specify `--no-interaction`.\n- Also, `COMPOSER_NO_AUDIT` is set to `1`. So if you want to audit your dependencies for security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to add a `composer audit` step before you install them.\n\n## :signal_strength: Coverage Support\n\n### Xdebug\n\nSpecify `coverage: xdebug` to use `Xdebug` and disable `PCOV`.  \nRuns on all [PHP versions supported](#tada-php-support ""List of PHP versions supported on this GitHub Action"").\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with Xdebug\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    coverage: xdebug\n```\n\n- When you specify `coverage: xdebug`, the latest version of Xdebug compatible with the PHP version is set up by default.\n- If you need Xdebug 2.x on PHP 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, you can specify `coverage: xdebug2`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with Xdebug 2.x\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'7.4\'\n    coverage: xdebug2\n```\n\n**Note**: Xdebug is enabled by default on Ubuntu GitHub Actions images, so if you are not using it in your workflow it is recommended to disable it as that will have a positive impact on your PHP performance. Please refer to the [disable coverage](#disable-coverage) section for details.\n\n### PCOV\n\nSpecify `coverage: pcov` to use `PCOV` and disable `Xdebug`.  \nRuns on PHP 7.1 and newer PHP versions.\n\n- If your source code directory is other than `src`, `lib` or, `app`, specify `pcov.directory` using the `ini-values` input.  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with PCOV\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    ini-values: pcov.directory=api #optional, see above for usage.\n    coverage: pcov\n```\n\n- PHPUnit 8.x and above supports PCOV out of the box.  \n- If you are using PHPUnit 5.x, 6.x or 7.x, you need to set up `pcov/clobber` before executing your tests.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PCOV\n  run: |\n    composer require pcov/clobber\n    vendor/bin/pcov clobber\n```\n\n### Disable Coverage\n\nSpecify `coverage: none` to disable both `Xdebug` and `PCOV`.\n\nDisable coverage for these reasons:\n\n- You are not generating coverage reports while testing.\n- You are using `phpdbg` for running your tests.\n- You are profiling your code using `blackfire`.\n- You are using PHP in JIT mode. Please refer to [JIT configuration](#jit-configuration) section for more details.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with no coverage driver\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    coverage: none\n```\n\n## :memo: Usage\n\n### Inputs\n\n> Specify using `with` keyword\n\n#### `php-version` (optional)\n\n- Specify the PHP version you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'8.0\'`.\n- Accepts `latest` to set up the latest stable PHP version.\n- Accepts `nightly` to set up a nightly build from the master branch of PHP.\n- Accepts the format `d.x`, where `d` is the major version. For example `5.x`, `7.x` and `8.x`.  \n- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.\n- If not specified, it looks for `php-version-file` input.\n\n#### `php-version-file` (optional)\n\n- Specify a file with the PHP version you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string`. For example `\'.phpenv-version\'`.\n- See [PHP support](#tada-php-support) for the supported PHP versions.\n- By default, `.php-version` file is used.\n- If not specified and the default `.php-version` file is not found, the latest stable PHP version is set up.\n\n#### `extensions` (optional)\n\n- Specify the extensions you want to add or disable.\n- Accepts a `string` in csv-format. For example `mbstring, :opcache`.\n- Accepts `none` to disable all shared extensions.\n- Shared extensions prefixed with `:` are disabled.\n- See [PHP extension support](#heavy_plus_sign-php-extension-support) for more info.\n\n#### `ini-file` (optional)\n\n- Specify the base `php.ini` file.\n- Accepts `production`, `development` or `none`.\n- By default, production `php.ini` file is used.\n\n#### `ini-values` (optional)\n\n- Specify the values you want to add to `php.ini`. \n- Accepts a `string` in csv-format. For example `post_max_size=256M, max_execution_time=180`.\n- Accepts ini values with commas if wrapped in quotes. For example `xdebug.mode=""develop,coverage""`.  \n\n#### `coverage` (optional)\n\n- Specify the code-coverage driver you want to set up.\n- Accepts `xdebug`, `pcov` or `none`.\n- See [coverage support](#signal_strength-coverage-support) for more info.\n\n#### `tools` (optional)\n\n- Specify the tools you want to set up.\n- Accepts a `string` in csv-format. For example: `phpunit, phpcs`\n- See [tools support](#wrench-tools-support) for tools supported.\n\n### Outputs\n\n#### `php-version`\n\nOn GitHub Actions you can assign the `setup-php` step an `id`, you can use the same to get the outputs in a later step.\n\n- Provides the PHP version in semver format.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  id: setup-php\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n\n- name: Print PHP version\n  run: echo ${{ steps.setup-php.outputs.php-version }}\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n> Specify using `env` keyword\n\n#### `fail-fast` (optional)\n\n- Specify to mark the workflow as failed if an extension or tool fails to set up.\n- This changes the default mode from graceful warnings to fail-fast.\n- By default, it is set to `false`.\n- Accepts `true` and `false`.\n\n#### `phpts` (optional)\n\n- Specify to set up a thread-safe build of PHP on Linux and Windows.\n- Accepts `ts` and `nts`.\n- By default, it is set to `nts`.\n- See [thread safe setup](#thread-safe-setup) for more info.\n\n#### `update` (optional)\n\n- Specify to update PHP on the runner to the latest patch version.\n- Accepts `true` and `false`.\n- By default, it is set to `false`.\n- See [force update setup](#force-update-setup) for more info.\n\nSee below for more info.\n\n### Basic Setup\n\n> Set up a particular PHP version.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    extensions: mbstring, intl\n    ini-values: post_max_size=256M, max_execution_time=180\n    coverage: xdebug\n    tools: php-cs-fixer, phpunit\n```\n\n### Matrix Setup\n\n> Set up multiple PHP versions on multiple operating systems.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.operating-system }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        operating-system: [\'ubuntu-latest\', \'windows-latest\', \'macos-latest\']\n        php-versions: [\'8.1\', \'8.2\', \'8.3\']\n        phpunit-versions: [\'latest\']\n        include:\n          -

These have compatible `Nodejs` installed for `setup-php`.\n- Currently, for `ARM` based setup, you will need [self-hosted runners](#self-hosted-setup).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container: shivammathur/node:latest-${{ matrix.arch }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        arch: [""amd64"", ""i386""]\n    steps:\n      - name: Install PHP\n        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n        with:\n          php-version: \'8.2\'\n```\n\n### Self Hosted Setup\n\n> Set up PHP on a self-hosted runner.\n\n- To set up a containerised self-hosted runner, refer to the following guides as per your base operating system.\n  - [Linux](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Linux)\n  - [Windows](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Dockerized-self-hosted-runner-on-Windows)\n\n- To set up the runner directly on the host OS or in a virtual machine, follow this [requirements guide](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Requirements-for-self-hosted-runners ""Requirements guide for self-hosted runner to run setup-php"") before setting up the self-hosted runner.\n- If your workflow uses [service containers](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idservices ""GitHub Actions Services""), then set up the runner on a Linux host or in a Linux virtual machine. GitHub Actions does not support nested virtualization on Linux, so services will not work in a dockerized container.\n\nIt is recommended to specify the environment variable `runner` with the value `self-hosted` for self-hosted environments.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: self-hosted\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        php-versions: [\'5.6\', \'7.0\', \'7.1\', \'7.2\', \'7.3\', \'7.4\', \'8.0\', \'8.1\', \'8.2\']\n    name: PHP ${{ matrix.php-versions }}\n    steps:\n    - name: Setup PHP\n      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n      with:\n        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-versions }}\n      env:\n        runner: self-hosted\n```\n\n**Notes**\n- Do not set up multiple self-hosted runners on a single server instance as parallel workflow will conflict with each other.\n- Do not set up self-hosted runners on the side on your development environment or your production server.\n- Avoid using the same labels for your `self-hosted` runners which are used by `GitHub-hosted` runners.\n\n### Local Testing Setup\n\n> Test your `Ubuntu` workflow locally using [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act ""Project to test GitHub Actions locally"").\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Setup PHP\n      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n      with:\n        php-version: \'8.2\'\n```\n\nRun the workflow locally with `act` using [`shivammathur/node`](https://github.com/shivammathur/node-docker ""Docker image to run setup-php"") docker images.\n\nChoose the image tag which matches the `runs-on` property in your workflow. For example, if you are using `ubuntu-20.04` in your workflow, run `act -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:2004`.\n\n```bash\n# For runs-on: ubuntu-latest\nact -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest\n\n# For runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\nact -P ubuntu-22.04=shivammathur/node:2204\n\n# For runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\nact -P ubuntu-20.04=shivammathur/node:2004\n```\n\n### JIT Configuration\n\n> Enable Just-in-time (JIT) on PHP 8.0 and above.\n\n- To enable JIT, enable `opcache` in cli mode by setting `opcache.enable_cli=1`.\n- JIT conflicts with `Xdebug`, `PCOV`, and other extensions which override `zend_execute_ex` function, so set `coverage: none` and disable any such extension if added.\n- By default, `opcache.jit=1235` and `opcache.jit_buffer_size=256M` are set which can be changed using `ini-values` input.\n- For detailed information about JIT related directives refer to the [`official PHP documentation`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.jit ""opcache.jit documentation"").\n\nFor example to enable JIT in `tracing` mode with buffer size of `64 MB`. \n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP with JIT in tracing mode\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    coverage: none\n    ini-values: opcache.enable_cli=1, opcache.jit=tracing, opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M\n```\n\n### Cache Extensions\n\nYou can cache PHP extensions using `shivammathur/cache-extensions` and `action/cache` GitHub Actions. Extensions which take very long to set up when cached are available in the next workflow run and are enabled directly. This reduces the workflow execution time.  \nRefer to [`shivammathur/cache-extensions`](https://github.com/shivammathur/cache-extensions ""GitHub Action to cache php extensions"") for details.\n\n### Cache Composer Dependencies\n\nIf your project uses composer, you can persist the composer\'s internal cache directory. Dependencies cached are loaded directly instead of downloading them while installation. The files cached are available across check-runs and will reduce the workflow execution time.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Get composer cache directory\n  id: composer-cache\n  run: echo ""dir=$(composer config cache-files-dir)"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n- name: Cache dependencies\n  uses: actions/cache@v3\n  with:\n    path: ${{ steps.composer-cache.outputs.dir }}\n    key: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles(\'**/composer.lock\') }}\n    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-\n\n- name: Install dependencies\n  run: composer install --prefer-dist\n```\n\n**Notes**\n- Please do not cache `vendor` directory using `action/cache` as that will have side effects.\n- If you do not commit `composer.lock`, you can use the hash of `composer.json` as the key for your cache.\n```yaml\nkey: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ hashFiles(\'**/composer.json\') }}\n```\n\n- If you support a range of `composer` dependencies and use `prefer-lowest` and `prefer-stable` options, you can store them in your matrix and add them to the keys.\n```yaml\nkey: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ matrix.prefer }}-${{ hashFiles(\'**/composer.lock\') }}\nrestore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-composer-${{ matrix.prefer }}-\n```\n\n### GitHub Composer Authentication\n\nIf you have a number of workflows which set up multiple tools or have many composer dependencies, you might hit the GitHub\'s rate limit for composer. Also, if you specify only the major version or the version in `major.minor` format, you can hit the rate limit. To avoid this you can specify an `OAuth` token by setting `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. You can use [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token ""GITHUB_TOKEN documentation"") secret for this purpose.\n\nThe `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable has been deprecated in favor of `GITHUB_TOKEN` and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Private Packagist Authentication\n\nIf you use Private Packagist for your private composer dependencies, you can set the `PACKAGIST_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n  env:\n    PACKAGIST_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGIST_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Manual Composer Authentication\n\nIn addition to GitHub or Private Packagist, if you want to authenticate private repositories hosted elsewhere, you can set the `COMPOSER_AUTH_JSON` environment variable with the authentication methods and the credentials in json format.\nPlease refer to the authentication section in [`composer documentation`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md ""composer documentation"") for more details.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n  env:\n    COMPOSER_AUTH_JSON: |\n      {\n        ""http-basic"": {\n          ""example.org"": {\n            ""username"": ""${{ secrets.EXAMPLE_ORG_USERNAME }}"",\n            ""password"": ""${{ secrets.EXAMPLE_ORG_PASSWORD }}""\n          }\n        }\n      }\n```\n\n### Inline PHP Scripts\n\nIf you have to run multiple lines of PHP code in your workflow, you can do that easily without saving it to a file.\n\nPut the code in the run property of a step and specify the shell as `php {0}`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n\n- name: Run PHP code\n  shell: php {0}\n  run: |\n    <?php\n    $welcome = ""Hello, world"";\n    echo $welcome;\n```\n\n### Problem Matchers\n\nProblem matchers are `json` configurations which identify errors and warnings in your logs and surface them prominently in the GitHub Actions UI by highlighting them and creating code annotations.\n\n#### PHP\n\nSetup problem matchers for your `PHP` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup problem matchers for PHP\n  run: echo ""::add-matcher::${{ runner.tool_cache }}/php.json""\n```\n\n#### PHPUnit\n\nSetup problem matchers for your `PHPUnit` output by adding this step after the `setup-php` step.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup problem matchers for PHPUnit\n  run: echo ""::add-matcher::${{ runner.tool_cache }}/phpunit.json""\n```\n\n#### PHPStan\n\nPHPStan supports error reporting in GitHub Actions, so it does not require problem matchers.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: phpstan\n\n- name: Run PHPStan\n  run: phpstan analyse src\n```\n\n#### Psalm\n\nPsalm supports error reporting in GitHub Actions with an output format `github`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: psalm\n\n- name: Run Psalm\n  run: psalm --output-format=github\n```\n\n#### Tools with checkstyle support\n\nFor tools that support `checkstyle` reporting like `phpstan`, `psalm`, `php-cs-fixer` and `phpcs` you can use `cs2pr` to annotate your code.  \nFor examples refer to the [cs2pr documentation](https://github.com/staabm/annotate-pull-request-from-checkstyle).\n\n> Here is an example with `phpcs`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup PHP\n  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n  with:\n    php-version: \'8.2\'\n    tools: cs2pr, phpcs\n\n- name: Run phpcs\n  run: phpcs -q --report=checkstyle src | cs2pr\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples of using `setup-php` with various PHP frameworks

It is a rolling tag and is synced with the latest minor and patch releases. With `v2` you automatically get the bug fixes, security patches, new features and support for latest PHP releases.\n- Semantic release versions can also be used. It is recommended to [use dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-github-dependabot ""Setup Dependabot with GitHub Actions"") with semantic versioning to keep the actions in your workflows up to date.\n- Commit SHA can also be used, but are not recommended. They have to be updated with every release manually, without which you will not get any bug fixes, security patches or new features.\n- For debugging any issues `verbose` tag can be used temporarily. It outputs all the logs and is also synced with the latest releases.\n- It is highly discouraged to use the `master` branch as version, it might break your workflow after major releases as they have breaking changes.\n- If you are using the `v1` tag or a `1.x.y` version, you should [switch to v2](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/wiki/Switch-to-v2 ""Guide for switching from setup-php v1 to v2"") as `v1` only gets critical bug fixes. Maintenance support for `v1` will be dropped with the last `PHP 8.0` release.\n\n## :scroll: License\n\n- The scripts and documentation in this project are under the [MIT License](LICENSE ""License for shivammathur/setup-php""). \n- This project has multiple [dependencies](#package-dependencies ""Dependencies for this PHP Action"").

Installed versions are subject to change. Please refer to the\ndocumentation:\n[Software installed on github hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software)\nfor .NET SDK versions that are currently available.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n**Basic**:\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: \'3.1.x\'\n- run: dotnet build <my project>\n```\n> **Warning**: Unless a concrete version is specified in the [`global.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file, **_the latest .NET version installed on the runner (including preinstalled versions) will be used [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection#the-sdk-uses-the-latest-installed-version)_**. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software) for the currently preinstalled .NET SDK versions.\n\n**Multiple version installation**:\n```yml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- name: Setup dotnet\n  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: | \n      3.1.x\n      5.0.x\n- run: dotnet build <my project>\n```\n## Supported version syntax\n\nThe `dotnet-version` input supports following syntax:\n\n- **A.B.C** (e.g 6.0.400, 7.0.100-preview.7.22377.5) - installs exact version of .NET SDK\n- **A.B** or **A.B.x** (e.g. 3.1, 3.1.x) - installs the latest patch version of .NET SDK on the channel `3.1`, including prerelease versions (preview, rc)\n- **A** or **A.x** (e.g. 3, 3.x) - installs the latest minor version of the specified major tag, including prerelease versions (preview, rc)\n- **A.B.Cxx** (e.g. 6.0.4xx) - available since `.NET 5.0` release. Installs the latest version of the specific SDK release, including prerelease versions (preview, rc). \n\n\n## Using the `dotnet-quality` input\nThis input sets up the action to install the latest build of the specified quality in the channel. The possible values of `dotnet-quality` are: **daily**, **signed**, **validated**, **preview**, **ga**.\n\n> **Note**: `dotnet-quality` input can be used only with .NET SDK version in \'A.B\', \'A.B.x\', \'A\', \'A.x\' and \'A.B.Cxx\' formats where the major version is higher than 5. In other cases, `dotnet-quality` input will be ignored.\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: \'6.0.x\'\n    dotnet-quality: \'preview\'\n- run: dotnet build <my project>\n```\n\n## Using the `global-json-file` input\n`setup-dotnet` action can read .NET SDK version from a `global.json` file. Input `global-json-file` is used for specifying the path to the `global.json`. If the file that was supplied to `global-json-file` input doesn\'t exist, the action will fail with error.\n\n>**Note**: In case both `dotnet-version` and `global-json-file` inputs are used, versions from both inputs will be installed.\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    global-json-file: csharp/global.json\n- run: dotnet build <my project>\n  working-directory: csharp\n```\n\n## Caching NuGet Packages\nThe action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood for caching global packages data but requires less configuration settings. The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.\n\nThe action searches for [NuGet Lock files](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) (`packages.lock.json`) in the repository root, calculates their hash and uses it as a part of the cache key. If lock file does not exist, this action throws error. Use `cache-dependency-path` for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.\n\n> **Warning**: Caching NuGet packages is available since .NET SDK 2.1.500 and 2.2.100 as the NuGet lock file [is available](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) only for NuGet 4.9 and above.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: 6.x\n    cache: true\n- run: dotnet restore --locked-mode\n```\n\n> **Note**: This action will only restore `global-packages` folder, so you will probably get the [NU1403](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu1403) error when running `dotnet restore`.\n> To avoid this, you can use [`DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder`](https://github.com/dotnet/reproducible-builds/blob/abfe986832aa28597d3340b92469d1a702013d23/Documentation/Reproducible-MSBuild/Techniques/DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder.md) option.\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n  <DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>true</DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n### Reduce caching size\n\n> **Note**: Use [`NUGET_PACKAGES`](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-environment-variables) environment variable if available. Some action runners already has huge libraries. (ex. Xamarin)\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  NUGET_PACKAGES: ${{ github.workspace }}/.nuget/packages\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: 6.x\n    cache: true\n- run: dotnet restore --locked-mode\n```\n\n### Caching NuGet packages in monorepos\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  NUGET_PACKAGES: ${{ github.workspace }}/.nuget/packages\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: 6.x\n    cache: true\n    cache-dependency-path: subdir/packages.lock.json\n- run: dotnet restore --locked-mode\n```\n\n## Matrix Testing\nUsing `setup-dotnet` it\'s possible to use [matrix syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) to install several versions of .NET SDK:\n```yml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        dotnet: [ \'2.1.x\', \'3.1.x\', \'5.0.x\' ]\n    name: Dotnet ${{ matrix.dotnet }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Setup dotnet\n        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n        with:\n          dotnet-version: ${{ matrix.dotnet }}\n      - name: Execute dotnet\n        run: dotnet build <my project>\n```\n>**Note**: Unless a concrete version is specified in the [`global.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file, the latest .NET version installed on the runner (including preinstalled versions) will be used [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection#the-sdk-uses-the-latest-installed-version). To control this behavior you may want to use temporary `global.json` files:\n\n**Matrix testing with temporary global.json creation**\n```yml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        dotnet: [ \'2.1.x\', \'3.1.x\', \'5.0.x\' ]\n    name: Dotnet ${{ matrix.dotnet }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Setup dotnet\n        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n        id: stepid\n        with:\n          dotnet-version: ${{ matrix.dotnet }}\n      - name: Create temporary global.json\n        run: echo \'{""sdk"":{""version"": ""${{ steps.stepid.outputs.dotnet-version }}""}}\' > ./global.json\n      - name: Execute dotnet\n        run: dotnet build <my project>\n```\n## Setting up authentication for nuget feeds\n\n### Github Package Registry (GPR)\n```yml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: \'3.1.x\'\n    source-url: https://nuget.pkg.github.com/<owner>/index.json\n  env:\n    NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n- run: dotnet build <my project>\n- name: Create the package\n  run: dotnet pack --configuration Release <my project>\n- name: Publish the package to GPR\n  run: dotnet nuget push <my project>/bin/Release/*.nupkg\n```\n\n### Azure Artifacts\n```yml\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    source-url: https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<your-organization>/_packaging/<your-feed-name>/nuget/v3/index.json\n  env:\n    NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT}} # Note, create a secret with this name in Settings\n- name: Publish the package to Azure Artifacts\n  run: dotnet nuget push <my project>/bin/Release/*.nupkg\n```\n\n### nuget.org\n```yml\n- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: 3.1.x\n- name: Publish the package to nuget.org\n  run: dotnet nuget push */bin/Release/*.nupkg -k $NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\n  env:\n    NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NUGET_TOKEN }}\n```\n> **Note**: It\'s the only way to push a package to nuget.org feed for macOS/Linux machines due to API key config store limitations.\n\n# Outputs and environment variables\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `dotnet-version`\n\nUsing the **dotnet-version** output it\'s possible to get the installed by the action .NET SDK version. \n\n**Single version installation**\n\nIn case of a single version installation, the `dotnet-version` output contains the version that is installed by the action.\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n      id: stepid\n      with:\n        dotnet-version: 3.1.422\n    - run: echo \'${{ steps.stepid.outputs.dotnet-version }}\' # outputs 3.1.422\n```\n\n**Multiple version installation**\n\nIn case of a multiple version installation, the `dotnet-version` output contains the latest version that is installed by the action.\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n      id: stepid\n      with:\n        dotnet-version: | \n          3.1.422\n          5.0.408\n    - run: echo \'${{ steps.stepid.outputs.dotnet-version }}\' # outputs 5.0.408\n```\n**Installation from global.json**\n\nWhen the `dotnet-version` input is used along with the `global-json-file` input, the `dotnet-version` output contains the version resolved from the `global.json`.\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n      id: stepid\n      with:\n        dotnet-version: | \n          3.1.422\n          5.0.408\n        global-json-file: ""./global.json"" # contains version 2.2.207\n    - run: echo \'${{ steps.stepid.outputs.dotnet-version }}\' # outputs 2.2.207\n```\n\n### `cache-hit`\nA boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the cache key (follows [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache#outputs))\n\n## Environment variables\n\nSome environment variables may be necessary for your particular case or to improve logging. Some examples are listed below, but the full list with complete details can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables\n\n| **Env.variable**      | **Description** | **Default value** |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR      |Specifies a directory where .NET SDKs should be installed by the action.|*default value for each OS* |\n| DOTNET_NOLOGO      |Removes logo and telemetry message from first run of dotnet cli|*false*|\n| DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT   |Opt-out of telemetry being sent to Microsoft|*false*|\n| DOTNET_MULTILEVEL_LOOKUP   |Configures whether the global install location is used as a fall-back|*true*|\n| NUGET_PACKAGES |Configures a path to the [NuGet `global-packages` folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders)|*default value for each OS* |\n\nThe default values of the `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` and `NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variables depend on the operation system which is used on a runner:\n| **Operation system** | `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` | `NUGET_PACKAGES` |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| **Windows** | `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet` | `%userprofile%\\.nuget\\packages` |\n| **Ubuntu** | `/usr/share/dotnet` | `~/.nuget/packages` |\n| **macOS** | `/Users/runner/.dotnet` | `~/.nuget/packages` |\n\n**Example usage of environment variable**:\n```yml\nbuild:\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  env:\n    DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR: ""path/to/directory""\n    NUGET_PACKAGES: ${{ github.workspace }}/.nuget/packages\n  steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@main\n    - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n      with:\n        dotnet-version: \'3.1.x\'\n        cache: true\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

20,"b'This action is a part of [GitHub Actions Library](https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-library/) created by [rtCamp](https://github.com/rtCamp/).\n\n# Slack Notify - GitHub Action\n[![Project Status: Active \xe2\x80\x93 The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)\n\n\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to send a message to a Slack channel.\n\n**Screenshot**\n\n<img width=""485"" alt=""action-slack-notify-rtcamp"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54996943-9d38c700-4ff0-11e9-9d35-7e2c16ef0d62.png"">\n\nThe `Site` and `SSH Host` details are only available if this action is run after [Deploy WordPress GitHub action](https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress).\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use this action after any other action. Here is an example setup of this action:\n\n1. Create a `.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml` file in your GitHub repo.\n2. Add the following code to the `slack-notify.yml` file.\n\n```yml\non: push\nname: Slack Notification Demo\njobs:\n  slackNotification:\n    name: Slack Notification\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Slack Notification\n      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2\n      env:\n        SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}\n```\n\n3. Create `SLACK_WEBHOOK` secret using [GitHub Action\'s Secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can [generate a Slack incoming webhook token from here](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).\n\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nBy default, action is designed to run with minimal configuration but you can alter Slack notification using following environment variables:\n\nVariable          | Default                                               | Purpose\n------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSLACK_CHANNEL     | Set during Slack webhook creation                     | Specify Slack channel in which message needs to be sent\nSLACK_USERNAME    | `rtBot`                                               | Custom Slack Username sending the message. Does not need to be a ""real"" username.\nSLACK_MSG_AUTHOR  | `$GITHUB_ACTOR` (The person who triggered action).    | GitHub username of the person who has triggered the action. In case you want to modify it, please specify corrent GitHub username.\nSLACK_ICON        | ![rtBot Avatar](https://github.com/rtBot.png?size=32) | User/Bot icon shown with Slack message. It uses the URL supplied to this env variable to display the icon in slack message.\nSLACK_ICON_EMOJI  | -                                                     | User/Bot icon shown with Slack message, in case you do not wish to add a URL for slack icon as above, you can set slack emoji in this env variable. Example value: `:bell:` or any other valid slack emoji.\nSLACK_COLOR       | `good` (green)                                        | You can pass `${{ job.status }}` for automatic coloring or an RGB value like `#efefef` which would change color on left side vertical line of Slack message.\nSLACK_LINK_NAMES  | -                                                     | If set to `true`, enable mention in Slack message. \nSLACK_MESSAGE     | Generated from git commit message.                    | The main Slack message in attachment. It is advised not to override this.\nSLACK_TITLE       | Message                                               | Title to use before main Slack message.\nSLACK_FOOTER      | Powered By rtCamp\'s GitHub Actions Library            | Slack message footer.\nMSG_MINIMAL       | -                                                     | If set to `true`, removes: `Ref`, `Event`,  `Actions URL` and `Commit` from the message. You can optionally whitelist any of these 4 removed values by passing it comma separated to the variable instead of `true`. (ex: `MSG_MINIMAL: event` or `MSG_MINIMAL: ref,actions url`, etc.)\n\nYou can see the action block with all variables as below:\n\n```yml\n    - name: Slack Notification\n      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2\n      env:\n        SLACK_CHANNEL: general\n        SLACK_COLOR: ${{ job.status }} # or a specific color like \'good\' or \'#ff00ff\'\n        SLACK_ICON: https://github.com/rtCamp.png?size=48\n        SLACK_MESSAGE: \'Post Content :rocket:\'\n        SLACK_TITLE: Post Title\n        SLACK_USERNAME: rtCamp\n        SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}\n```\n\nBelow screenshot help you visualize message part controlled by different variables:\n\n<img width=""600"" alt=""Screenshot_2019-03-26_at_5_56_05_PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54997488-d1f94e00-4ff1-11e9-897f-a35ab90f525f.png"">\n\nThe `Site` and `SSH Host` details are only available if this action is run after [Deploy WordPress GitHub action](https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress).\n\n## Hashicorp Vault (Optional)\n\nThis GitHub action supports [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).\n\nTo enable Hashicorp Vault support, please define following GitHub secrets:\n\nVariable      | Purpose                                                                       | Example Vaule\n--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------\n`VAULT_ADDR`  | [Vault server address](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#vault_addr) | `https://example.com:8200`\n`VAULT_TOKEN` | [Vault token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html)          | `s.gIX5MKov9TUp7iiIqhrP1HgN`\n\nYou will need to change `secrets` line in `slack-notify.yml` file to look like below.\n\n```yml\non: push\nname: Slack Notification Demo\njobs:\n  slackNotification:\n    name: Slack Notification\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - name: Slack Notification\n      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2\n      env:\n        VAULT_ADDR: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ADDR }}\n        VAULT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nGitHub action uses `VAULT_TOKEN` to connect to `VAULT_ADDR` to retrieve slack webhook from Vault.\n\nIn the Vault, the Slack webhook should be setup as field `webhook` on path `secret/slack`.\n\n## Credits\nSource: [technosophos/slack-notify](https://github.com/technosophos/slack-notify)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE) \xc2\xa9 2022 rtCamp\n\n## Does this interest you?\n\n<a href=""https://rtcamp.com/""><img src=""https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/github-banner@2x.png"" alt=""Join us at rtCamp, we specialize in providing high performance enterprise WordPress solutions""></a>\n'","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Default: Current repository\n\n#### `body_path`\nThe `body_path` is valuable for dynamically creating a `.md` within code commits and even within the Github Action steps leading up to the `create-release`.\n\n### Outputs\nFor more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-4) for an example of what these outputs look like\n\n- `id`: The release ID\n- `html_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`\n- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action\n\n### Example workflow - create a release\nOn every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release):\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags\n    tags:\n      - \'v*\' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10\n\nname: Create Release\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Create Release\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Create Release\n        id: create_release\n        uses: actions/create-release@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This token is provided by Actions, you do not need to create your own token\n        with:\n          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}\n          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}\n          body: |\n            Changes in this Release\n            - First Change\n            - Second Change\n          draft: false\n          prerelease: false\n```\n\nThis will create a [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases), as well as a [`release` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#releaseevent), which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset) GitHub Action. This uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by the [virtual environment](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret), so no new token is needed.\n\n## Contributing\nWe would love you to contribute to `@actions/create-release`, pull requests are welcome!

23,"b'# `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda`\n\nThis action sets up a `base`\n[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment by one of:\n\n- locating the `conda` installation [bundled] with the available runners and\n  available in `$CONDA`\n- installing a specific (or latest) version of\n  - [Miniconda3][miniconda-repo]\n  - [Miniforge][miniforge-releases] (or Mambaforge)\n  - any [constructor]-based installer by or URL or filesystem path\n\nA `conda-build-version` or `mamba-version` may be provided to install into\n`base`.\n\nThe base `condabin/` folder is added to `$PATH` and shell integration is\ninitialized across all platforms.\n\nBy default, this action will then create, and _activate_, an environment by one\nof:\n\n- creating a mostly-empty `test` environment, containing only the latest\n  `python-version` and its dependencies\n- creating an `test` environment described in a given `environment-file`:\n  - an `environment.yml`-like file (which can be patched with `python-version`)\n    - the patched environment will be cleaned up unless\n      `clean-patched-environment-file: false` is given\n  - a [lockfile](#example-7-lockfiles)\n\nThis action correctly handles activation of environments and offers the\npossibility of automatically activating the `test` environment on all shells.\n\n> **Please** see the **[IMPORTANT](#important)**

by default activate an environment called `test`, _not_\nactivate the `base` environment. This encourages the practice of not using the\n`base` environment to install packages used for the workflow and leave the\n`base` environment untouched, with only `conda` (and/or `mamba`) in it.\n\n## Inputs and outputs\n\nFor a full list of available _inputs_ and _outputs_ for this action see\n[action.yml](action.yml).\n\n### Use a different environment name or path\n\nYou can change the default `test` environment to have a different name or path\nby setting the `activate-environment` input option.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    activate-environment: whatever\n```\n\nThis will be create a _named_ env in `$CONDA/envs/whatever`, where `$CONDA` is\nthe path to the infrequently-updated, but **very fast** to start, ""bundled""\nMiniconda installation.\n\n> - If `activate-environment` contains either POSIX or Windows slashes, it will\n>   be interpreted as a path, or `prefix` in `conda` terminology.

On this example an\nenvironment named `test` will be created with the specific `python-version`\ninstalled for each opearating system, resulting on 6 build workers.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-1:\n    name: Ex1 (${{ matrix.python-version }}, ${{ matrix.os }})\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu-latest"", ""macos-latest"", ""windows-latest""]\n        python-version: [""3.7"", ""2.7""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          auto-update-conda: true\n          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n      - name: Conda info\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: conda info\n      - name: Conda list\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: conda list\n```\n\n### Example 2: Other shells\n\nThis example shows how to use all other available shells for specific operating\nsystems. On this example we select to download the latest anaconda version\navailable and create and activate by default an environment named `foo`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-2-linux:\n    name: Ex2 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-mac:\n    name: Ex2 Mac\n    runs-on: ""macos-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Sh\n        shell: sh -l {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n\n  example-2-win:\n    name: Ex2 Windows\n    runs-on: ""windows-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          miniconda-version: ""latest""\n          activate-environment: foo\n      - name: Bash\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell\n        shell: powershell\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: PowerShell Core\n        shell: pwsh\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n      - name: Cmd.exe\n        shell: cmd /C CALL {0}\n        run: >-\n          conda info && conda list\n```\n\n### Example 3: Other options\n\nThis example shows how to use [environment.yml](etc/example-environment.yml) for\neasier creation of test/build environments and\n[.condarc](etc/example-condarc.yml) files for fine grained configuration\nmanagement. On this example we use a custom configuration file, install an\nenvironment from a yaml file and disable autoactivating the base environment\nbefore activating the `anaconda-client-env`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-3:\n    name: Ex3 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          python-version: 3.5\n          condarc-file: etc/example-condarc.yml\n          auto-activate-base: false\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n```\n\n### Example 4: Conda options\n\nThis example shows how to use `channels` option and other extra options. The\npriority will be set by the order of the channels. In this example it will\nresult in:\n\n- conda-forge\n- spyder-ide\n- defaults\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-4:\n    name: Ex4 Linux\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: foo\n          python-version: 3.6\n          channels: conda-forge,spyder-ide\n          allow-softlinks: true\n          channel-priority: flexible\n          show-channel-urls: true\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n```\n\n### Example 5: Custom installer\n\nAny installer created with [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)\nwhich includes `conda` can be used in place of Miniconda. For example,\n[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) maintains additional builds of\n[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases) for platforms not\nyet supported by Miniconda. For more, see [Example 10](#example-10-miniforge).\n\n> Notes:\n>\n> - Installer downloads are cached based on their full URL: adding some\n>   non-functional salt to the URL will prevent this behavior, e.g.\n>   `#${{ github.run_number }}`\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-5:\n    name: Ex5 Miniforge for PyPy\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          installer-url: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/download/4.8.3-2/Miniforge-pypy3-4.8.3-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n          allow-softlinks: true\n          show-channel-urls: true\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n```\n\n### Example 6: Mamba\n\nExperimental! Use `mamba` to handle conda installs in a faster way.\n`mamba-version` accepts a version string `x.y` (including `""*""`). It requires\nyou specify `conda-forge` as part of the channels, ideally with the highest\npriority.\n\n> Notes:\n>\n> - If a [custom installer](#example-5-custom-installer) provides `mamba`, it\n>   can be prioritized wherever possible (including installing `mamba-version`)\n>   with `use-mamba: true`.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-6:\n    name: Ex6 Mamba\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.6\n          mamba-version: ""*""\n          channels: conda-forge,defaults\n          channel-priority: true\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n      - shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n          printenv | sort\n      - shell: bash -el {0}\n        run: mamba install jupyterlab\n```\n\n### Example 7: Lockfiles\n\n`conda list --explicit` and [conda-lock][] support generating [explicit\nenvironment specifications][explicit-spec], which skip the environment solution\nstep altogether, as they contain the _ordered_ list of exact URLs needed to\nreproduce the environment.\n\nThis means explicitly-defined environments...\n\n- are _much faster_ to install, as several expensive steps are skipped:\n  - channels are not queried for their repo data\n  - no solver is run\n- are not cross-platform, as the URLs almost always contain\n  platform/architecture information\n- can become broken if any file becomes unavailable\n\nThis approach can be useful as part of a larger system e.g. a separate workflow\nthat runs `conda-lock` for all the platforms needed in a separate job.\n\n[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock\n[explicit-spec]:\n  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-7:\n    name: Ex7 Explicit\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          auto-update-conda: false\n          activate-environment: explicit-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-explicit.conda.lock\n      - run: |\n          conda info\n          conda list\n          conda config --show-sources\n          conda config --show\n          printenv | sort\n```\n\n### Example 10: Miniforge\n\n[Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) provides a number of\nalternatives to Miniconda, built from the ground up with `conda-forge` packages\nand with only `conda-forge` in its default channels.\n\nIf only `miniforge-version` is provided, `Miniforge3` will be used.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-10-miniforge:\n    name: Ex10 (${{ matrix.os }}, Miniforge)\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu"", ""macos"", ""windows""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          miniforge-version: latest\n```\n\nIn addition to `Miniforge3` with `conda` and `CPython`, for each of its many\nsupported platforms and architectures, additional variants including\n`Mambaforge` (which comes pre-installed `mamba` in addition to `conda` on all\nplatforms) and `Miniforge-pypy3`/`Mamabaforge-pypy3` (which replace `CPython`\nwith `pypy3` on Linux/MacOS) are available.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-10-mambaforge:\n    name: Ex10 (${{ matrix.os }}, Mambaforge)\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""ubuntu"", ""macos"", ""windows""]\n        include:\n          - os: ubuntu\n            environment-file: etc/example-environment-no-name.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n            miniforge-version: 4.9.2-4\n          - os: macos\n            environment-file: etc/example-empty-channels-environment.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge-pypy3\n          - os: windows\n            environment-file: etc/example-explicit.Windows.conda.lock\n            condarc-file: etc/example-condarc.yml\n            miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          condarc-file: ${{ matrix.condarc-file }}\n          environment-file: ${{ matrix.environment-file }}\n          miniforge-variant: ${{ matrix.miniforge-variant }}\n          miniforge-version: ${{ matrix.miniforge-version }}\n          use-mamba: true\n```\n\n### Example 11: Alternative Architectures\n\nIn addition to the default 64-bit builds of Miniconda, 32-bit versions are\navailable for Windows. Note that although some x86 builds are available for\nLinux and MacOS, these are too old (<4.6) to be supported by this action.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  example-11:\n    name:\n      Ex11 (os=${{ matrix.os }} architecture=${{ matrix.architecture }}\n      miniconda-version=${{ matrix.miniconda-version }})\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [""windows-latest""]\n        architecture: [""x86""]\n        miniconda-version: [""latest""]\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: ./\n        with:\n          architecture: ${{ matrix.architecture }}\n          miniconda-version: $${{ matrix.miniconda-version }}\n          auto-update-conda: true\n          python-version: ""3.8""\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n### Caching packages\n\nIf you want to enable package caching for conda you can use the\n[cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache) using `~/conda_pkgs_dir` as\npath for conda packages.\n\nThe cache will use a explicit key for restoring and saving the cache.\n\nThis can be based in the contents of files like:\n\n- `setup.py`\n- `requirements.txt`\n- `environment.yml`\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  caching-example:\n    name: Caching\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Cache conda\n        uses: actions/cache@v2\n        env:\n          # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n          CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n        with:\n          path: ~/conda_pkgs_dir\n          key:\n            ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}-${{\n            hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment.yml\') }}\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          channel-priority: strict\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment.yml\n          use-only-tar-bz2: true # IMPORTANT: This needs to be set for caching to work properly!\n```\n\nIf you are using pip to resolve any dependencies in your conda environment then\nyou may want to\n[cache those dependencies separately](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#caching-dependencies),\nas they are not included in the conda package cache.\n\n### Caching environments\n\nThe first installation step should setup a Miniconda variant without specifying\na environment file.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup Mambaforge\n  uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n  with:\n    miniforge-variant: Mambaforge\n    miniforge-version: latest\n    activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n    use-mamba: true\n```\n\nIt\'s a good idea to refresh the cache every 24 hours to avoid inconsistencies of\npackage versions between the CI pipeline and local installations. Here we ensure\nthat this happens by adding the current date to the cache key. You can remove\nthe ""Get Date"" step below if you use a resolved environment file product of\n`conda env export` or `conda list --explicit`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Get Date\n  id: get-date\n  run: echo ""today=$(/bin/date -u \'+%Y%m%d\')"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n  shell: bash\n\n- name: Cache Conda env\n  uses: actions/cache@v2\n  with:\n    path: ${{ env.CONDA }}/envs\n    key:\n      conda-${{ runner.os }}--${{ runner.arch }}--${{\n      steps.get-date.outputs.today }}-${{\n      hashFiles(\'etc/example-environment-caching.yml\') }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER\n      }}\n  env:\n    # Increase this value to reset cache if etc/example-environment.yml has not changed\n    CACHE_NUMBER: 0\n  id: cache\n```\n\nKeep in mind that hashing `etc/example-environment-caching.yml` is not the same\nas hashing a resolved environment file. `conda` (and `mamba`) resolves the\ndependencies declared in the YAML file according to the packages available on\nthe channels at installation time. Since packages are updated all the time, you\nwill not see these changes reflected in the cache until the key gets updated by\ndate.\n\n**This means that the same environment file can make your tests pass locally but\nfail on CI, or the other way around. In that case, reset the cache manually to\nsee if that leads to consistent results, or use a resolved environment file.**\n\nFinally, update the environment based on the environment file if the cache does\nnot exist.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Update environment\n  run:\n    mamba env update -n anaconda-client-env -f\n    etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n  if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n```\n\n### Use a default shell\n\nAssuming you are using the bash shell, now adding to `shell: bash -el {0}` to\nevery single step can be avoided if your workflow uses the same shell for all\nthe steps.\n\nBy adding a `defaults` section and specifying the `bash -el {0}`, all steps in\nthe job will default to that value.\n\nFor other shells, make sure to use the right `shell` parameter as the default\nvalue. Check the [section below](#important) for some examples.\n\nMore information the\n[Github help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  default-shell:\n    name: Default shell\n    runs-on: ""ubuntu-latest""\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash -el {0}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2\n        with:\n          activate-environment: anaconda-client-env\n          environment-file: etc/example-environment-caching.yml\n      - run: conda info\n      - run: conda list\n      - run: conda config --show\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\n- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: bash -el {0}` on steps that need to be\n  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are\n  executed with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated\n  on bash profile files made by `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell)\n  and\n  [thread](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/How-to-share-shell-profile-between-steps-or-how-to-use-nvm-rvm/td-p/33185).\n- Sh shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: sh -l {0}` on steps that need to be properly\n  activated (or use a default shell). This is because sh shells are executed\n  with `sh -e {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash profile files made by\n  `conda init bash`. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be\n  explicitely declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be\n  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are\n  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C ""CALL ""{0}""""` and the `/D` flag\n  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which\n  is what `conda init cmd.exe` sets. See\n  [Github Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n- For caching to work properly, you will need to set the `use-only-tar-bz2`\n  option to `true`.\n- Some options (e.g. `use-only-tar-bz2`) are not available on the default conda\n  installed on Windows VMs, be sure to use `auto-update-conda` or provide a\n  version of conda compatible with the option.\n- If you plan to use a `environment.yaml` file to set up the environment, the\n  action will read the `channels`listed in the key (if found). If you provide\n  the `channels` input in the action they must not conflict with what was\n  defined in `environment.yaml`, otherwise the conda solver might find conflicts\n  and result in very long install times.\n- Conda activation does not correctly work on `sh`.

24,"b""# Download-Artifact v3\n\nThis downloads artifacts from your build\n\nSee also [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).\n\n# What's new\n\n- Download all artifacts at once\n- Output parameter for the download path\n- Port entire action to typescript from a runner plugin so it is easier to collaborate and accept contributions\n\nRefer [here](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/tree/v2) for the previous version\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n# Download a Single Artifact\n\nBasic (download to the current working directory):\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    \n- name: Display structure of downloaded files\n  run: ls -R\n```\n\nDownload to a specific directory:\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: path/to/artifact\n    \n- name: Display structure of downloaded files\n  run: ls -R\n  working-directory: path/to/artifact\n```\n\nBasic tilde expansion is supported for the `path` input:\n```yaml\n  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n    with:\n      name: my-artifact\n      path: ~/download/path\n```\n\n## Compatibility between `v1` and `v2`/`v3`\n\nWhen using `download-artifact@v1`, a directory denoted by the name of the artifact would be created if the `path` input was not provided. All of the contents would be downloaded to this directory.\n```\n   current/working/directory/\n      my-artifact/\n          ... contents of my-artifact\n```\n\nWith `v2` and `v3`, when an artifact is specified by the `name` input, there is no longer an extra directory that is created if the `path` input is not provided. All the contents are downloaded to the current working directory.\n```\n   current/working/directory/\n      ... contents of my-artifact\n```\n\nTo maintain the same behavior for `v2` and `v3`, you can set the `path` to the name of the artifact so an extra directory gets created.\n```\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v2\n  with:\n    name: my-artifact\n    path: my-artifact\n```\n\n\n# Download All Artifacts\n\nIf the `name` input parameter is not provided, all artifacts will be downloaded. **To differentiate between downloaded artifacts, a directory denoted by the artifacts name will be created for each individual artifact.**\nExample, if there are two artifacts `Artifact-A` and `Artifact-B`, and the directory is `etc/usr/artifacts/`, the directory structure will look like this:\n```\n  etc/usr/artifacts/\n      Artifact-A/\n          ... contents of Artifact-A\n      Artifact-B/\n          ... contents of Artifact-B\n```\n\nDownload all artifacts to a specific directory\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n  with:\n    path: path/to/artifacts\n    \n- name: Display structure of downloaded files\n  run: ls -R\n  working-directory: path/to/artifacts\n```\n\nDownload all artifacts to the current working directory\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n\n- name: Display structure of downloaded files\n  run: ls -R\n```\n\n# Download path output\n\nThe `download-path` step output contains information regarding where the artifact was downloaded to. This output can be used for a variety of purposes such as logging or as input to other actions. Be aware of the extra directory that is created if downloading all artifacts (no name specified).\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n- uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n  id: download\n  with:\n    name: 'my-artifact'\n    path: path/to/artifacts\n\n- name: 'Echo download path'\n  run: echo ${{steps.download.outputs.download-path}}\n```\n\n> Note: The `id` defined in the `download/artifact` step must match the `id` defined in the `echo` step (i.e `steps.[ID].outputs.download-path`)\n\n# Limitations\n\n### Permission Loss\n\n:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.\n\n### Case Insensitive Uploads\n\n:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.\n\n### Maintaining file permissions and case sensitive files\n\nIf file permissions and case sensitivity are required, you can `tar` all of your files together before artifact upload. Post download, the `tar` file will maintain file permissions and case sensitivity.\n\n```yaml\n  - name: 'Tar files'\n    run: tar -cvf my_files.tar /path/to/my/directory\n\n  - name: 'Upload Artifact'\n    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n    with:\n      name: my-artifact\n      path: my_files.tar    \n```\n\n# @actions/artifact package\n\nInternally the [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) NPM package is used to interact with artifacts.

25,"b'[![SWUbanner]][SWUdocs]\n\n[![\xf0\x9f\xa7\xaa GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow tests badge]][GHA workflow runs list]\n[![pre-commit.ci status badge]][pre-commit.ci results page]\n\n# PyPI publish GitHub Action\n\nThis action allows you to upload your [Python distribution packages]\nin the `dist/` directory to PyPI.\nThis text suggests a minimalistic usage overview. For more detailed\nwalkthrough check out the [PyPA guide].\n\nIf you have any feedback regarding specific action versions, please leave\ncomments in the corresponding [per-release announcement discussions].\n\n\n## \xf0\x9f\x8c\x87 `master` branch sunset \xe2\x9d\x97\n\nThe `master` branch version has been sunset. Please, change the GitHub\nAction version you use from `master` to `release/v1` or use an exact\ntag, or opt-in to [use a full Git commit SHA] and Dependabot.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Trusted publishing\n\n> **NOTE**: Trusted publishing is sometimes referred to by its\n> underlying technology -- OpenID Connect, or OIDC for short.\n> If you see references to ""OIDC publishing"" in the context of PyPI,\n> this is what they\'re referring to.\n\nThis example jumps right into the current best practice. If you want to\nuse API tokens directly or a less secure username and password, check out\n[how to specify username and password].\n\nThis action supports PyPI\'s [trusted publishing]\nimplementation, which allows authentication to PyPI without a manually\nconfigured API token or username/password combination. To perform\n[trusted publishing] with this action, your project\'s\npublisher must already be configured on PyPI.\n\nTo enter the trusted publishing flow, configure this action\'s job with the\n`id-token: write` permission and **without** an explicit username or password:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml\njobs:\n  pypi-publish:\n    name: Upload release to PyPI\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    environment:\n      name: pypi\n      url: https://pypi.org/p/<your-pypi-project-name>\n    permissions:\n      id-token: write  # IMPORTANT: this permission is mandatory for trusted publishing\n    steps:\n    # retrieve your distributions here\n\n    - name: Publish package distributions to PyPI\n      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1\n```\n\n> **Pro tip**: instead of using branch pointers, like `unstable/v1`, pin\nversions of Actions that you use to tagged versions or sha1 commit identifiers.\nThis will make your workflows more secure and better reproducible, saving you\nfrom sudden and unpleasant surprises.\n\nOther indices that support trusted publishing can also be used, like TestPyPI:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish package distributions to TestPyPI\n  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1\n  with:\n    repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n```\n_(don\'t forget to update the environment name to `testpypi` or similar!)_\n\n> **Pro tip**: only set the `id-token: write` permission in the job that does\n> publishing, not globally. Also, try to separate building from publishing\n> \xe2\x80\x94 this makes sure that any scripts maliciously injected into the build\n> or test environment won\'t be able to elevate privileges while flying under\n> the radar.\n\nA common use case is to upload packages only on a tagged commit, to do so add a\nfilter to the job:\n\n```yml\n    if: github.event_name == \'push\' && startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags\')\n```\n\n\n## Non-goals\n\nThis GitHub Action [has nothing to do with _building package\ndistributions_]. Users are responsible for preparing dists for upload\nby putting them into the `dist/` folder prior to running this Action.\n\n> **IMPORTANT**: Since this GitHub Action is docker-based, it can only\n> be used from within GNU/Linux based jobs in GitHub Actions CI/CD\n> workflows. This is by design and is unlikely to change due to a number\n> of considerations we rely on.\n>\n> This should not stop one from publishing platform-specific\n> distribution packages, though. It is strongly advised to separate jobs\n> for building the OS-specific wheels from the publish job. This allows\n> one to (1) test exactly the same artifacts that are about to be\n> uploaded to PyPI, (2) prevent parallel unsynchronized jobs from\n> publishing only part of the dists asynchronously (in case when part of\n> the jobs fail and others succeed ending up with an incomplete release\n> on PyPI) and (3) make an atomic upload to PyPI (when part of the dists\n> appear on PyPI, installers like pip will use that version for the\n> dependency resolution but this may cause some environments to use\n> sdists while the wheel for their runtime is not yet available).\n>\n> To implement this sort of orchestration, please use\n> `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions for\n> sharing the built dists across stages and jobs. Then, use the `needs`\n> setting to order the build, test and publish stages.\n\n\n## Advanced release management\n\nFor best results, figure out what kind of workflow fits your\nproject\'s specific needs.\n\nFor example, you could implement a parallel job that\npushes every commit to TestPyPI or your own index server,\nlike `devpi`. For this, you\'d need to (1) specify a custom\n`repository-url` value and (2) generate a unique version\nnumber for each upload so that they\'d not create a conflict.\nThe latter is possible if you use `setuptools_scm` package but\nyou could also invent your own solution based on the distance\nto the latest tagged commit.\n\nYou\'ll need to create another token for a separate host and then [save it as a\nGitHub repo secret][Creating & using secrets] under an environment used in\nyour job. Though, passing a password would disable the secretless [trusted\npublishing] so it\'s better to configure it instead, when publishing to TestPyPI\nand not something custom.\n\nThe action invocation in this case would look like:\n```yml\n- name: Publish package to TestPyPI\n  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1\n  with:\n    password: ${{ secrets.TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN }}\n    repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n```\n\n### Customizing target package dists directory\n\nYou can change the default target directory of `dist/`\nto any directory of your liking. The action invocation\nwould now look like:\n\n```yml\n- name: Publish package to PyPI\n  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1\n  with:\n    packages-dir: custom-dir/\n```\n\n### Disabling metadata verification\n\nIt is recommended that you run `twine check` just after producing your files,\nbut this also runs `twine check` before upload. You can also disable the twine\ncheck with:\n\n```yml\n   with:\n     verify-metadata: false\n```\n\n### Tolerating release package file duplicates\n\nSometimes, when you publish releases from multiple places, your workflow\nmay hit race conditions. For example, when publishing from multiple CIs\nor even having workflows with the same steps triggered within GitHub\nActions CI/CD for different events concerning the same high-level act.\n\nTo facilitate this use-case, you may use `skip-existing` (disabled by\ndefault) setting as follows:\n\n```yml\n   with:\n     skip-existing: true\n```\n\n> **Pro tip**: try to avoid enabling this setting where possible. If you\nhave steps for publishing to both PyPI and TestPyPI, consider only using\nit for the latter, having the former fail loudly on duplicates.\n\n### For Debugging\n\nSometimes, `twine upload` can fail and to debug use the `verbose` setting as follows:\n\n```yml\n   with:\n     verbose: true\n```\n\n### Showing hash values of files to be uploaded\n\nYou may want to verify whether the files on PyPI were automatically uploaded by CI script.\nIt will show SHA256, MD5, BLAKE2-256 values of files to be uploaded.\n\n```yml\n  with:\n    print-hash: true\n```\n\n### Specifying a different username\n\nThe default username value is `__token__`. If you publish to a custom\nregistry that does not provide API tokens, like `devpi`, you may need to\nspecify a custom username and password pair. This is how it\'s done.\n\n```yml\n  with:\n    user: guido\n    password: ${{ secrets.DEVPI_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\nThe secret used in `${{ secrets.DEVPI_PASSWORD }}` needs to be created on the\nenvironment page under the settings of your project on GitHub.\nSee [Creating & using secrets].\n\nIn the past, when publishing to PyPI, the most secure way of the access scoping\nfor automatic publishing was to use the [API tokens][PyPI API token] feature of\nPyPI. One would make it project-scoped and save as an environment-bound secret\nin their GitHub repository settings, naming it `${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}`,\nfor example. See [Creating & using secrets]. While still secure,\n[trusted publishing] is now encouraged over API tokens as a best practice\non supported platforms (like GitHub).\n\n## License\n\nThe Dockerfile and associated scripts and documentation in this project\nare released under the [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n[\xf0\x9f\xa7\xaa GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow tests badge]:\nhttps://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/actions/workflows/self-smoke-test-action.yml/badge.svg?branch=unstable%2Fv1&event=push\n[GHA workflow runs list]:\nhttps://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/actions/workflows/self-smoke-test-action.yml?query=branch%3Aunstable%2Fv1\n\n[pre-commit.ci results page]:\nhttps://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/unstable/v1\n[pre-commit.ci status badge]:\nhttps://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/unstable/v1.svg\n\n[use a full Git commit SHA]:\nhttps://julienrenaux.fr/2019/12/20/github-actions-security-risk/\n\n[per-release announcement discussions]:\nhttps://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/discussions/categories/announcements\n\n[Creating & using secrets]:\nhttps://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets\n[has nothing to do with _building package distributions_]:\nhttps://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/issues/11#issuecomment-530480449\n[PyPA guide]:\nhttps://packaging.python.org/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/\n[PyPI API token]: https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken\n[Python distribution packages]:\nhttps://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package\n[SWUbanner]:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/banner-direct-single.svg\n[SWUdocs]:\nhttps://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/blob/main/docs/README.md\n\n[warehouse#12965]: https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/12965\n[trusted publishing]: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/\n\n[how to specify username and password]: #specifying-a-different-username\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
26,"b'# Commitlint Github Action\n\nLints Pull Request commits with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate a github workflow in the `.github` folder, e.g. `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Lint Commit Messages\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  commitlint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run on other event types such as `on: [push]`. In that case the action will lint the push event\'s commit(s) instead of linting commits from a pull request. You can also combine `push` and `pull_request` together in the same workflow.\n\n## Inputs\n\nYou can supply these inputs to the `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` step.\n\n### `configFile`\n\nThe path to your commitlint config file.\n\nDefault: `commitlint.config.js`\n\nIf the config file doesn\'t exist, [config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) settings will be loaded as a default fallback.\n\nDetails on the configuration file can be found on [the commitlint website](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-configuration).\n\n### `failOnWarnings`\n\nWhether you want to fail on warnings or not.\n\nDefault: `false`\n\n### `failOnErrors`\n\nWhether you want to fail on errors or not. Still outputs the results, just forces the action to pass even if errors are detected.\n\nDefault: `true`\n\n### `helpURL`\n\nLink to a page explaining your commit message convention.\n\ndefault: `https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint`\n\n### `commitDepth`\n\nWhen set to a valid Integer value - X, considers only the latest X number of commits.\n\ndefault: `null` (Equivalent to linting all commits)\n\n### `token`\n\nPersonal access token (PAT) used to interact with the GitHub API.\nBy default, the automatic token provided by GitHub is used.\nYou can see more info about GitHub\'s default token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token).\n\ndefault: `${{ github.token }}`\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `results`\n\nThe error and warning messages for each one of the analyzed commits. This is useful if you want to use the commitlint results in a JSON format in other jobs. See [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#fromjson) on how to read JSON information from outputs.\n\nBelow you can see an example text output together with its corresponding JSON output:\n\n```\nYou have commit messages with errors\n\n\xe2\xa7\x97   input: wrong message\n\xe2\x9c\x96   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]\n\xe2\x9c\x96   type may not be empty [type-empty]\n\n\xe2\x9c\x96   found 2 problems, 0 warnings\n\xe2\x93\x98   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint\n\n\xe2\xa7\x97   input: chore: my message\n\xe2\x9a\xa0   body must have leading blank line [body-leading-blank]\n\n\xe2\x9a\xa0   found 0 problems, 1 warnings\n\xe2\x93\x98   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint\n```\n\n```JSON\n[\n  {\n    ""hash"": ""cb0f846f13b490c2fd17bd5ed0b6f65ba9b86c75"",\n    ""message"": ""wrong message"",\n    ""valid"": false,\n    ""errors"": [""subject may not be empty"", ""type may not be empty""],\n    ""warnings"": [],\n  },\n  {\n    ""hash"": ""cb14483cbde23b61322ffb8d3fcdc87f514a3141"",\n    ""message"": ""chore: my message\\n\\nsome context without leading blank line"",\n    ""valid"": true,\n    ""errors"": [],\n    ""warnings"": [""body must have leading blank line""],\n  },\n]\n```\n\n## About `extends` in your config file\n\nThis is a [`Docker` action](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/e2adf403d6d14a9ca7474976ccaca20f72ff8209/docs/action-types.md#why-would-i-choose-a-docker-action), and was made like this so that you can run it with minimum setup, regardless of your repo\'s environment. It comes packed with the most famous shared configurations that you can use in your commitlint config\'s `extends` field:\n\n- [@commitlint/config-angular](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-angular)\n- [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)\n- [@commitlint/config-lerna-scopes](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-lerna-scopes)\n- [@commitlint/config-patternplate](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-patternplate)\n- [conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical](https://github.com/gajus/conventional-changelog-lint-config-canonical)\n- [commitlint-config-jira](https://github.com/Gherciu/commitlint-jira)\n- [commitlint-config-function-rules](https://github.com/vidavidorra/commitlint-plugin-function-rules#readme)\n\nApart from the shared configurations that are included by default, you can also include extra dependencies for other configs and plugins that you want to use.\n\nIn order to do so, you can use `NODE_PATH` env var to make the action take those dependencies into account. Below is an example workflow that does that.\n\n```yaml\nname: Lint Commit Messages\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  commitlint:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: \'14\'\n      - run: npm install\n      # Run the commitlint action, considering its own dependencies and yours as well \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n      # `github.workspace` is the path to your repository.\n      - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5\n        env:\n          NODE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/node_modules\n```\n\n---\n\n\xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 You can see other ways to install your dependencies (including private ones) in [the Setup Node action\'s docs](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).\n\n---\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The legal values of each is a three digit number corresponding to *nix file permissions, e.g. 664, or 775.\n* **configuration** - Any additional custom configuration for server in JSON format.\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Servers](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#servers)\n\n### `mirrors`\n\n* **id** - The unique identifier of this mirror. The `id` is used to differentiate between mirror elements and to pick the corresponding credentials from the `<servers>` section when connecting to the mirror.\n* **mirrorOf** - The `id` of the repository that this is a mirror of. For example, to point to a mirror of the Maven central repository (`https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/`), set this element to `central`. More advanced mappings like `repo1,repo2` or `*,!inhouse` are also possible. This must not match the mirror `id`.\n* **url** - The base URL of this mirror. The build system will use this URL to connect to a repository rather than the original repository URL.\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Mirrors](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#mirrors)\n\n### `repositories`\n**Optional** json array of repositories to add to settings.xml\n* **id** - The ID of the repository that matches the id element of the server.\n* **name** - Name of the repository.\n* **url** - URL to connect to repository.\n* **releases.enabled** - Enable release policy.\n* **snapshots.enabled** - Enable snapshot policy.\n\nWhen not `repostories` is empty or null, the Maven Central repository is applied by default:\n\n```yaml\nrepositories: |\n  [\n    {\n      ""id"": ""central"",\n      ""name"": ""Maven Central"",\n      ""url"": ""https://repo1.maven.org/maven2"",\n      ""releases"": {\n        ""enabled"": ""true""\n      },\n      ""snapshots"": {\n        ""enabled"": ""false""\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Repositories](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#repositories)\n\n### `plugin_repositories`\n**Optional** json array of repositories to add to settings.xml\n* **id** - The ID of the repository that matches the id element of the server.\n* **name** - Name of the repository.\n* **url** - URL to connect to repository.\n* **releases.enabled** - Enable release policy.\n* **snapshots.enabled** - Enable snapshot policy.\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Plugin Repositories](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Plugin_Repositories)\n\n### `plugin_groups`\n**Optional** json array of plugin groups to add to settings.xml\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Plugin Groups](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Plugin_Groups)\n\n### `profiles`\n**Optional** json array of profiles to add to settings.xml\n\nThe `profile` element in the `settings.xml` is a truncated version of the `pom.xml` `profile` element. It consists of the `activation`, `repositories`, `pluginRepositories` and `properties` elements. The `profile` elements only include these four elements because they concerns themselves with the build system as a whole (which is the role of the `settings.xml` file), not about individual project object model settings.\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Profiles](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#profiles)\n\n### `active_profiles`\n**Optional** json array of active profiles to add to settings.xml\n\nSet of `activeProfile` elements, which each have a value of a `profile` `id`. Any `profile` `id` defined as an `activeProfile` will be active, regardless of any environment settings. If no matching profile is found nothing will happen. For example, if `env-test` is an `activeProfile`, a profile in a `pom.xml` (or `profile.xml`) with a corresponding `id` will be active. If no such profile is found then execution will continue as normal.\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Active Profiles](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Active_Profiles)\n\n### `proxies`\n\n**Optional** json array of proxies to add to settings.xml.\n* **id** - The unique identifier for this proxy. This is used to differentiate between proxy elements.\n* **active** - true if this proxy is active. This is useful for declaring a set of proxies, but only one may be active at a time.\n* **protocol, host, port** - The protocol://host:port of the proxy, separated into discrete elements.\n* **username, password** - These elements appear as a pair denoting the login and password required to authenticate to this proxy server.\n* **nonProxyHosts** - This is a list of hosts which should not be proxied. The delimiter of the list is the expected type of the proxy server; the example above is pipe delimited - comma delimited is also common.\n\n\nReference: [Maven Settings > Proxies](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#proxies)\n\n### `output_file`\n**Optional** String path of to generate `settings.xml`. By default, `~/.m2/settings.xml` is used. \n\nWhen using a custom `output_file`, for example:\n```yaml\n- uses: whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action@v20\n  with:\n    output_file: foo/custom.xml\n```\n\nThe generated `settings.xml` will be created at `/home/runner/work/{repo}/foo/custom.xml`, which can be referenced in maven steps using `mvn --settings foo/custom.xml {goal}`.\n\n---\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n````yaml\n- name: maven-settings-xml-action\n  uses: whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action@v20\n  with:\n    repositories: \'[{ ""id"": ""some-repository"", ""url"":

You can use it to remove false-positives by specifying replacement patterns and ignore patterns. The filename is interpreted relative to the repository root.|`mlc_config.json`|\n|`folder-path` |By default the `github-action-markdown-link-check` action checks for all markdown files in your repository. Use this option to limit checks to only specific folders. Use comma separated values for checking multiple folders. |`.` |\n|`max-depth` |Specify how many levels deep you want to check in the directory structure. The default value is `-1` which means check all levels.|`-1` |\n|`check-modified-files-only` |Use this variable to only check modified markdown files instead of checking all markdown files. The action uses `git` to find modified markdown files. Only use this variable when you run the action to check pull requests.|`no`|\n|`base-branch`|Use this variable to specify the branch to compare when finding modified markdown files. |`master`|\n|`file-extension`|By default the `github-action-markdown-link-check` action checks files in your repository with the `.md` extension. Use this option to specify a different file extension such as `.markdown` or `.mdx`.|`.md`|\n|`file-path` | Specify additional files (with complete path and extension) you want to check. Use comma separated values for checking multiple files.

See\n[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions - on.schedule](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule)\nfor more details.\n\n#### Sample workflow with scheduled job\n\n```yml\nname: Check Markdown links\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\n  schedule:\n  # Run everyday at 9:00 AM (See https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07)\n  - cron: ""0 9 * * *""\n\njobs:\n  markdown-link-check:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1\n      with:\n        use-quiet-mode: \'yes\'\n        use-verbose-mode: \'yes\'\n        config-file: \'mlc_config.json\'\n        folder-path: \'docs/markdown_files\'\n```\n\n### Disable check for some links\nYou can include the following HTML comments into your markdown files to disable\nchecking for certain links in a markdown document.\n\n1. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->` and `<!-- markdown-link-check-enable-->`: Use these to disable links for all links appearing between these\n    comments.\n   - Example:\n     ```md\n     <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->\n     ## Section\n\n     Disbale link checking in this section. Ignore this [Bad Link](https://exampleexample.cox)\n     <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->\n     ```\n2. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->` Use this comment to disable link checking for the next line.\n3. `<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->` Use this comment to disable link\n   checking for the current line.\n\n### Check only modified files in a pull request\n\nUse the following workflow to only check links in modified markdown files in a\npull request.\n\nWhen\nyou use this variable, the action finds modified files between two commits:\n- latest commit in you PR\n- latest commit in the `master` branch. If you are suing a different branch to\n  merge PRs, specify the branch using `base-branch`.\n\n> **NOTE**: We can also use GitHub API to get all modified files in a PR, but that\n> would require tokens and stuff, create an issue or PR if you need that.\n\n```yml\non: [pull_request]\nname: Check links for modified files\njobs:\n  markdown-link-check:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1\n      with:\n        use-quiet-mode: \'yes\'\n        use-verbose-mode: \'yes\'\n        check-modified-files-only: \'yes\'\n\n```\n\n### Check multiple directories and files\n\n```yml\non: [pull_request]\nname: Check links for modified files\njobs:\n  markdown-link-check:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1\n      with:\n        use-quiet-mode: \'yes\'\n        folder-path: \'md/dir1, md/dir2\'\n        file-path: \'./README.md, ./LICENSE, ./md/file4.markdown\'\n```\n\n### Too many requests\nUse `retryOn429`, `retry-after`, `retryCount`, and `fallbackRetryDelay` in your custom configuration file.\nSee https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check#config-file-format for details.\n\nOr mark 429 status code as alive:\n```json\n{\n  ""aliveStatusCodes"": [429, 200]\n}\n```\n\n### GitHub links failure fix\nUse the following `httpHeaders` in your custom configuration file to fix GitHub links failure.\n\n```json\n{\n  ""httpHeaders"": [\n    {\n      ""urls"": [""https://github.com/"", ""https://guides.github.com/"", ""https://help.github.com/"", ""https://docs.github.com/""],\n      ""headers"": {\n        ""Accept-Encoding"": ""zstd, br, gzip, deflate""\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\nConsider a workflow file that checks for the status of hyperlinks on push to the master branch,\n\n``` yml\nname: Check .md links\n\non:\n  push: [master]\n\njobs:\n  markdown-link-check:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # check out the latest version of the code\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    # Checks the status of hyperlinks in .md files in verbose mode\n    - name: Check links\n      uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1\n      with:\n        use-verbose-mode: \'yes\'\n```\nA file `test.md` exists, containing\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53875297/159135478-87194037-f3d6-4ca9-9da8-f01dac482fbc.png)\n\nOn running the workflow described above, the output shown below is obtained\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53875297/159135426-9f439d39-8bb3-40f0-9255-9efe2b493c1a.png)\n\n\n## Versioning\nGitHub Action - Markdown link check follows the [GitHub recommended versioning strategy](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md).\n\n1. To use a specific released version of the action ([Releases](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check/releases)):\n   ```yml\n   - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@1.0.1\n   ```\n1. To use a major version of the action:\n   ```yml\n   - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1\n   ```\n1. You can also specify a [specific commit SHA](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check/commits/master) as an action version:\n   ```yml\n   - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@44a942b2f7ed0dc101d556f281e906fb79f1f478\n   ```\n\n<hr>\n<p align=""center"">\n <a name=""coffee"" href=""https://ko-fi.com/gauravnelson"">\n  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/1Q1YoHz.gif"" alt=""Buy me a coffee."">\n </a>\n</p>\n\n\nSee https://pubsadasdsadasdasdasdas.aasasdas.odasdarg/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If not supplied, the node version from PATH will be used. However, it is recommended to always specify Node.js version and don\'t rely on the system one.\n\nThe action will first check the local cache for a semver match. If unable to find a specific version in the cache, the action will attempt to download a version of Node.js. It will pull LTS versions from [node-versions releases](https://github.com/actions/node-versions/releases) and on miss or failure will fall back to the previous behavior of downloading directly from [node dist](https://nodejs.org/dist/).\n\nFor information regarding locally cached versions of Node.js on GitHub hosted runners, check out [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).\n\n### Supported version syntax\n\nThe `node-version` input supports the Semantic Versioning Specification, for more detailed examples please refer to [the semver package documentation](https://github.com/npm/node-semver).\n\nExamples:\n\n - Major versions: `14`, `16`, `18`\n - More specific versions: `10.15`, `16.15.1` , `18.4.0`\n - NVM LTS syntax: `lts/erbium`, `lts/fermium`, `lts/*`, `lts/-n`\n - Latest release: `*` or `latest`/`current`/`node`\n\n**Note:** Like the other values, `*` will get the latest [locally-cached Node.js version](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md#nodejs), or the latest version from [actions/node-versions](https://github.com/actions/node-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json), depending on the [`check-latest`](docs/advanced-usage.md#check-latest-version) input.\n\n`current`/`latest`/`node` always resolve to the latest [dist version](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json).\nThat version is then downloaded from actions/node-versions if possible, or directly from Node.js if not.\nSince it will not be cached always, there is possibility of hitting rate limit when downloading from dist\n\n### Checking in lockfiles\n\nIt\'s **always** recommended to commit the lockfile of your package manager for security and performance reasons. For more information consult the ""Working with lockfiles"" section of the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md#working-with-lockfiles) guide.\n\n## Caching global packages data\n\nThe action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring dependencies. It uses [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) under the hood for caching global packages data but requires less configuration settings. Supported package managers are `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` (v6.10+). The `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.\n\nThe action defaults to search for the dependency file (`package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `yarn.lock`) in the repository root, and uses its hash as a part of the cache key. Use `cache-dependency-path` for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories.\n\n**Note:** The action does not cache `node_modules`\n\nSee the examples of using cache for `yarn`/`pnpm` and `cache-dependency-path` input in the [Advanced usage](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-data) guide.\n\n**Caching npm dependencies:**\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n  with:\n    node-version: 16\n    cache: \'npm\'\n- run: npm ci\n- run: npm test\n```\n\n**Caching npm dependencies in monorepos:**\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n  with:\n    node-version: 16\n    cache: \'npm\'\n    cache-dependency-path: subdir/package-lock.json\n- run: npm ci\n- run: npm test\n```\n\n## Matrix Testing\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node: [ 14, 16, 18 ]\n    name: Node ${{ matrix.node }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Setup node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n```\n\n## Using `setup-node` on GHES\n\n`setup-node` comes pre-installed on the appliance with GHES if Actions is enabled. When dynamically downloading Nodejs distributions, `setup-node` downloads distributions from [`actions/node-versions`](https://github.com/actions/node-versions) on github.com (outside of the appliance). These calls to `actions/node-versions` are made via unauthenticated requests, which are limited to [60 requests per hour per IP](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If more requests are made within the time frame, then you will start to see rate-limit errors during downloading that looks like: `##[error]API rate limit exceeded for...`. After that error the action will try to download versions directly from the official site, but it also can have rate limit so it\'s better to put token.\n\nTo get a higher rate limit, you can [generate a personal access token on github.com](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and pass it as the `token` input for the action:\n\n```yaml\nuses: actions/setup-node@v3\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GH_DOTCOM_TOKEN }}\n  node-version: 16\n```\n\nIf the runner is not able to access github.com, any Nodejs versions requested during a workflow run must come from the runner\'s tool cache. See ""[Setting up the tool cache on self-hosted runners without internet access](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)"" for more information.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n - [Check latest version](docs/advanced-usage.md#check-latest-version)\n - [Using a node version file](docs/advanced-usage.md#node-version-file)\n - [Using different architectures](docs/advanced-usage.md#architecture)\n - [Using v8 canary versions](docs/advanced-usage.md#v8-canary-versions)\n - [Using nightly versions](docs/advanced-usage.md#nightly-versions)\n - [Using rc versions](docs/advanced-usage.md#rc-versions)\n - [Caching packages data](docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-data)\n - [Using multiple operating systems and architectures](docs/advanced-usage.md#multiple-operating-systems-and-architectures)\n - [Publishing to npmjs and GPR with npm](docs/advanced-usage.md#publish-to-npmjs-and-gpr-with-npm)\n - [Publishing to npmjs and GPR with yarn](docs/advanced-usage.md#publish-to-npmjs-and-gpr-with-yarn)\n - [Using private packages](docs/advanced-usage.md#use-private-packages)\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

pull requests |\n| closed-issues-prs | List of all closed issues and pull requests |\n\n### Detailed options\n\n#### repo-token\n\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) that allows the stale workflow to authenticate and perform API calls to GitHub.  \nUnder the hood, it uses the [@actions/github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/github) package.\n\nDefault value: `${{ github.token }}`\n\n#### days-before-stale\n\nThe idle number of days before marking the issues or the pull requests as stale (by adding a label).  \nThe issues or the pull requests will be marked as stale if the last update (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) is older than the idle number of days.  \nIt means that any updates made, or any comments added to the issues or to the pull requests will restart the counter of days before marking as stale.  \nHowever, if you wish to ignore this behaviour so that the creation date (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `created_at`) only matters, you can disable the [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) option.\n\nIf set to a negative number like `-1`, no issues or pull requests will be marked as stale automatically.  \nIn that case, you can still add the stale label manually to mark as stale.\n\nThe label used to stale is defined by these two options:\n\n- [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label)\n- [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label)\n\nA comment can also be added to notify about the stale and is defined by these two options:\n\n- [stale-issue-message](#stale-issue-message)\n- [stale-pr-message](#stale-pr-message)\n\nYou can fine tune which issues or pull requests should be marked as stale based on the milestones, the assignees, the creation date and the missing/present labels from these options:\n\n- [exempt-issue-labels](#exempt-issue-labels)\n- [exempt-pr-labels](#exempt-pr-labels)\n- [only-labels](#only-labels)\n- [any-of-labels](#any-of-labels)\n- [start-date](#start-date)\n- [exempt-milestones](#exempt-milestones)\n- [exempt-all-milestones](#exempt-all-milestones)\n- [exempt-assignees](#exempt-assignees)\n- [exempt-all-assignees](#exempt-all-assignees)\n- [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates)\n\nDefault value: `60`\n\n#### days-before-issue-stale\n\nUseful to override [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) but only for the idle number of days before marking the issues as stale.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### days-before-pr-stale\n\nUseful to override [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) but only for the idle number of days before marking the pull requests as stale.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### days-before-close\n\nThe idle number of days before closing the stale issues or the stale pull requests (due to the stale label).  \nThe issues or the pull requests will be closed if the last update (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) is older than the idle number of days.  \nSince adding the stale label will alter the last update date, we can calculate the number of days from this date.\n\nIf set to a negative number like `-1`, the issues or the pull requests will never be closed automatically.\n\nThe label used to stale is defined by these two options:\n\n- [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label)\n- [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label)\n\nDefault value: `7`\n\n#### days-before-issue-close\n\nOverride [days-before-close](#days-before-close) but only for the idle number of days before closing the stale issues.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### days-before-pr-close\n\nOverride [days-before-close](#days-before-close) but only for the idle number of days before closing the stale pull requests.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### stale-issue-message\n\nThe message that will be added as a comment to the issues when the stale workflow marks it automatically as stale with a label.\n\nYou can skip the comment sending by passing an empty string.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write`\n\n#### stale-pr-message\n\nThe message that will be added as a comment to the pull requests when the stale workflow marks it automatically as stale with a label.\n\nYou can skip the comment sending by passing an empty string.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### close-issue-message\n\nThe message that will be added as a comment to the issues when the stale workflow closes it automatically after being stale for too long.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write`\n\n#### close-pr-message\n\nThe message that will be added as a comment to the pull requests when the stale workflow closes it automatically after being stale for too long.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### stale-issue-label\n\nThe label that will be added to the issues when automatically marked as stale.  \nIf you wish to speedup the stale workflow for the issues, you can add this label manually to mark as stale.\n\nDefault value: `Stale`  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write`\n\n#### close-issue-label\n\nThe label that will be added to the issues when closed automatically.  \nIt will be automatically removed if the issues are no longer closed nor locked.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write`\n\n#### close-issue-reason\n\nSpecify the [reason](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-the-new-github-issues-may-19th-update/) used when closing issues. Valid values are `completed` and `not_planned`.\n\nDefault value: `not_planned`\n\n#### stale-pr-label\n\nThe label that will be added to the pull requests when automatically marked as stale.  \nIf you wish to speedup the stale workflow for the pull requests, you can add this label manually to mark as stale.\n\nDefault value: `Stale`  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### close-pr-label\n\nThe label that will be added to the pull requests when closed automatically.  \nIt will be automatically removed if the pull requests are no longer closed nor locked.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### exempt-issue-labels\n\nComma separated list of labels that can be assigned to issues to exclude them from being marked as stale\n(e.g: `question,bug`)\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-pr-labels\n\nComma separated list of labels that can be assigned to pull requests to exclude them from being marked as stale\n(e.g: `need-help,WIP`)\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### only-labels\n\nAn allow-list of label(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that contain all these label(s).  \nIt can be a comma separated list of labels (e.g: `answered,needs-rebase`).\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nIf you wish to only check that the issues or the pull requests contain one of these label(s), use instead [any-of-labels](#any-of-labels).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### only-issue-labels\n\nOverride [only-labels](#only-labels) but only to process the issues that contain all these label(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### only-pr-labels\n\nOverride [only-labels](#only-labels) but only to process the pull requests that contain all these label(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### any-of-labels\n\nAn allow-list of label(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that contain one of these label(s).  \nIt can be a comma separated list of labels (e.g: `answered,needs-rebase`).\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nIf you wish to only check that the issues or the pull requests contain all these label(s), use instead [only-labels](#only-labels).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### any-of-issue-labels\n\nOverride [any-of-labels](#any-of-labels) but only to process the issues that contain one of these label(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### any-of-pr-labels\n\nOverride [any-of-labels](#any-of-labels) but only to process the pull requests that contain one of these label(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### operations-per-run\n\n_Context:_  \nThis action performs some API calls to GitHub to fetch or close issues and pull requests, set or update labels, add comments, delete branches, etc.  \nThese operations are made in a very short period of time \xe2\x80\x94 because the action is very fast to run \xe2\x80\x94 and can be numerous based on your project action configuration and the quantity of issues and pull requests within it.  \nGitHub has a [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) and if reached will block these API calls for one hour (or API calls from other actions using the same user (a.k.a.: the github-token from the [repo-token](#repo-token) option)).  \nThis option helps you to stay within the GitHub rate limits, as you can use this option to limit the number of operations for a single run.\n\n_Purpose:_  \nThis option aims to limit the number of operations made with the GitHub API to avoid reaching the [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting).\n\nBased on your project, your GitHub business plan and the date of the cron job you set for this action, you can increase this limit to a higher number.\nIf you are not sure which is the right value for you or if the default value is good enough, you could enable the logs and look at the end of the stale action.  \nIf you reached the limit, you will see a warning message in the logs, telling you that you should increase the number of operations.\nIf you choose not to increase the limit, you might end up with unprocessed issues or pull requests after a stale action run.\n\nWhen [debugging](#Debugging), you can set it to a much higher number like `1000` since there will be fewer operations made with the GitHub API.  \nOnly the [actor](#repo-token) and the batch of issues (100 per batch) will consume the operations.\n\nDefault value: `30`\n\n#### remove-stale-when-updated\n\nAutomatically remove the stale label when the issues or the pull requests are updated (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) or commented.\n\nDefault value: `true`  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### remove-issue-stale-when-updated\n\nOverride [remove-stale-when-updated](#remove-stale-when-updated) but only to automatically remove the stale label when the issues are updated (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) or commented.\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `issues: write`\n\n#### remove-pr-stale-when-updated\n\nOverride [remove-stale-when-updated](#remove-stale-when-updated) but only to automatically remove the stale label when the pull requests are updated (based on [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`) or commented.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### labels-to-add-when-unstale\n\nA comma delimited list of labels to add when a stale issue or pull request receives activity and has the [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label) or [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label) removed from it.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### labels-to-remove-when-stale\n\nA comma delimited list of labels to remove when an issue or pull request becomes stale and has the [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label) or [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label) added to it.\n\nWarning: each label results in a unique API call which can drastically consume the limit of [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run).\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### labels-to-remove-when-unstale\n\nA comma delimited list of labels to remove when a stale issue or pull request receives activity and has the [stale-issue-label](#stale-issue-label) or [stale-pr-label](#stale-pr-label) removed from it.\n\nWarning: each label results in a unique API call which can drastically consume the limit of [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run).\n\nDefault value: unset  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write`\n\n#### debug-only\n\nRun the stale workflow as dry-run.  \nNo GitHub API calls that can alter your issues and pull requests will happen.  \nUseful to debug or when you want to configure the stale workflow safely.\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n#### ascending\n\nChange the order used to fetch the issues and pull requests from GitHub:\n\n- `true` is for ascending.\n- `false` is for descending.\n\nIt can be useful if your repository is processing so many issues and pull requests that you reach the [operations-per-run](#operations-per-run) limit.  \nBased on the order, you could prefer to focus on the new content or on the old content of your repository.\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n#### start-date\n\nThe start date is used to ignore the issues and pull requests created before the start date.  \nParticularly useful when you wish to add this stale workflow on an existing repository and only wish to stale the new issues and pull requests.\n\nIf set, the date must be formatted following the `ISO 8601` or `RFC 2822` standard.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### delete-branch\n\nIf set to `true`, the stale workflow will automatically delete the GitHub branches related to the pull requests automatically closed by the stale workflow.\n\nDefault value: `false`  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: write` and `contents: write`\n\n#### exempt-milestones\n\nA white-list of milestone(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that does not contain one of these milestone(s).  \nIt can be a comma separated list of milestones (e.g: `V1,next`).\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-issue-milestones\n\nOverride [exempt-milestones](#exempt-milestones) but only to process the issues that does not contain one of these milestone(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-pr-milestones\n\nOverride [exempt-milestones](#exempt-milestones) but only to process the pull requests that does not contain one of these milestone(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-all-milestones\n\nIf set to `true`, the issues or the pull requests with a milestone will not be marked as stale automatically.\n\nPriority over [exempt-milestones](#exempt-milestones).\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n#### exempt-all-issue-milestones\n\nOverride [exempt-all-milestones](#exempt-all-milestones) but only to exempt the issues with a milestone to be marked as stale automatically.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-all-pr-milestones\n\nOverride [exempt-all-milestones](#exempt-all-milestones) but only to exempt the pull requests with a milestone to be marked as stale automatically.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-assignees\n\nAn allow-list of assignee(s) to only process the issues or the pull requests that does not contain one of these assignee(s).  \nIt can be a comma separated list of assignees (e.g: `marco,polo`).\n\nIf unset (or an empty string), this option will not alter the stale workflow.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-issue-assignees\n\nOverride [exempt-assignees](#exempt-assignees) but only to process the issues that does not contain one of these assignee(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-pr-assignees\n\nOverride [exempt-assignees](#exempt-assignees) but only to process the pull requests that does not contain one of these assignee(s).\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-all-assignees\n\nIf set to `true`, the issues or the pull requests with an assignee will not be marked as stale automatically.\n\nPriority over [exempt-assignees](#exempt-assignees).\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n#### exempt-all-issue-assignees\n\nOverride [exempt-all-assignees](#exempt-all-assignees) but only to exempt the issues with an assignee to be marked as stale automatically.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-all-pr-assignees\n\nOverride [exempt-all-assignees](#exempt-all-assignees) but only to exempt the pull requests with an assignee to be marked as stale automatically.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### exempt-draft-pr\n\nIf set to `true`, the pull requests currently in draft will not be marked as stale automatically.  \n\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This option consume one operation per pull request to process because we need to fetch the pull request with the GitHub API to know if it\'s a draft one or not.\n\nDefault value: `false`  \nRequired Permission: `pull-requests: read`\n\n#### enable-statistics\n\nCollects and display statistics at the end of the stale workflow logs to get a summary of what happened during the run.  \nThis option is only useful if the debug output secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` is set to `true` in your repository to display the logs.\n\nDefault value: `true`\n\n#### ignore-updates\n\nThe option [days-before-stale](#days-before-stale) will define the number of days before considering the issues or the pull requests as stale.  \nIn most cases, the purpose of this action is to only stale when necessary so if any update occurs or if a comment is added to them, the counter will restart.  \nNonetheless, if you don\'t care about this, and you prefer to stick to this number of days no matter the update, you can enable this option.  \nInstead of comparing the number of days based on the [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `updated_at`, it will be based on the [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues) field `created_at`.\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n#### ignore-issue-updates\n\nUseful to override [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) but only to ignore the updates for the issues.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### ignore-pr-updates\n\nUseful to override [ignore-updates](#ignore-updates) but only to ignore the updates for the pull requests.\n\nDefault value: unset\n\n#### include-only-assigned\n\nIf set to `true`, only the issues or the pull requests with an assignee will be marked as stale automatically.\n\nDefault value: `false`\n\n### Usage\n\nSee also [action.yml](./action.yml) for a comprehensive list of all the options.\n\nBasic:\n\n```yaml\nname: \'Close stale issues and

It can either be the current job status\nusing:\n\n      with:\n        status: ${{ job.status }}\n\nor a hardcoded custom status such as ""starting"" or ""in progress"":\n\n      with:\n        status: in progress\n\n#### `steps` (optional)\n\nThe individual status of job steps can be included in the Slack\nmessage using:\n\n      with:\n        status: ${{ job.status }}\n        steps: ${{ toJson(steps) }}\n\n**Note: Only steps that have a ""step id"" will be reported on. See example below.**\n\n#### `channel` (optional)\n\nTo override the channel or to send the Slack message to an individual\nuse:\n\n      with:\n        status: ${{ job.status }}\n        channel: \'#workflows\'\n\n**Note: To override the channel the Slack webhook URL must be an\nIncoming Webhook URL. See https://api.slack.com/faq#incoming_webhooks**\n\n### `message` (optional)\n\nTo override the slack message use:\n\n      with:\n        status: ${{ job.status }}\n        channel: \'#workflows\'\n        message: Deploying {{ env.GITHUB_REF_NAME }} branch\n\n### `config` (optional)\n\nA configuration file can be used to customise the following Slack message fields:\n\n  - `username`\n  - `icon_url`\n  - `pretext`\n  - `title` and `title_link`\n  - `text`\n  - `fallback` plain text summary used for dumb clients and notifications\n  - `fields` title, value and short/long\n  - `blocks` including `actions`, `context`, `divider`, `file`,  `header`, `image`, `input` and `section` blocks\n  - message `footer`\n  - border `colors` based job status `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`. valid colors are `good` (green), `warning` (yellow), `danger` (red) or any hex color code eg. `#439FE0`\n  - `icons` for step status `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, and a default\n\nDefault: `.github/slack.yml`\n\n      with:\n        status: ${{ job.status }}\n        config: .github/config/slack.yml\n\nThe following Slack [message fields](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments) and\n[block layouts](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) support templating using\n[Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) format:\n\n- `pretext`\n- `title`\n- `text` and `message`\n- `fallback`\n- `fields` `title` and `value`\n- `blocks`\n\n**Supported Template variables**\n\n`env.*`, `payload.*`, `jobName`, `jobStatus`, `jobSteps`,\n`eventName`, `workflow`, `workflowUrl`, `workflowRunUrl`, `repositoryName`, `repositoryUrl`, `runId`, `runNumber`, `sha`, `shortSha`, `branch`, `actor`, `action`, `ref`, `refType`, `refUrl`, `diffRef`, `diffUrl`, `description`, `sender`\n\n**Helper Functions**\n\nApart from the [standard helper functions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#if) such as `#if` and `#each` there are also a few custom\nones:\n\n- `icon` converts a job status into an icon eg. `{{icon jobStatus}}`\n- `json` dumps the value as a JSON string eg. `{{json payload.commits}}`\n- `truncate` cuts the string at the limit eg. `{{truncate sha 8}}`\n- `default` allows a alternative or default value eg. `{{default headRef ""master""}}`\n- `pluralize` outputs different text based on item count eg. `{{pluralize requested_reviewers ""reviewer"" ""reviewers""}}` (if only singular form is given plural is derived by adding an ""s"")\n\n- `eq`, `neq`, `not`, `and`, and `or` can be used as logical operators eg. `{{#if (and (not has_issues) (or has_pages has_wiki))}}yes{{else}}no{{/if}}`\n- `#ifeq` and `#ifneq` test for variable equality or not eg. `{{#ifneq event_name ""create""}}yes{{else}}no{{/ifneq}}`\n\n**Example Using Config File**\n\nTo generate the message format below use the `slack.yml` configuration file that follows.\n\n<img src=""./docs/images/example3.png"" width=""540"" title=""Slack Example #1"">\n\n*Example Configuration File: slack.yml*\n\n```\nusername: GitHub-CI\nicon_url: https://octodex.github.com/images/mona-the-rivetertocat.png\n\npretext: Triggered via {{eventName}} by {{actor}} {{or action ""action""}} {{ref}} `{{diffRef}}`\ntitle: GitHub Actions\ntitle_link: https://support.github.com\n\ntext: |\n  *<{{workflowRunUrl}}|Workflow _{{workflow}}_ job _{{jobName}}_ triggered by _{{eventName}}_ is _{{jobStatus}}_>* for <{{refUrl}}|`{{ref}}`>\n  {{#if description}}<{{diffUrl}}|`{{diffRef}}`> -

42,"b'# Octokit Request Action\n\n> A GitHub Action to send queries to GitHub\'s GraphQL API\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/octokit/graphql-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octokit/graphql-action/actions)\n\n## Usage\n\nMinimal example\n\n```yml\nname: Log latest release\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  logLatestRelease:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: octokit/graphql-action@v2.x\n        id: get_latest_release\n        with:\n          query: |\n            query release($owner:String!,$repo:String!) {\n              repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo) {\n                releases(first:1) {\n                  nodes {\n                    name\n                    createdAt\n                    tagName\n                    description\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          owner: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.name }}\n          repo: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - run: ""echo \'latest release: ${{ steps.get_latest_release.outputs.data }}\'""\n```\n\nYou can also use the `variables` parameter to pass variables.\n\n```yml\n- uses: octokit/graphql-action@v2.x\n  with:\n    query: |\n      query release($owner:String!,$repo:String!) {\n        repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo) {\n          releases(first:1) {\n            nodes {\n              name\n              createdAt\n              tagName\n              description\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    variables: |\n      owner: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.name }}\n      repo: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nTo access deep values of `outputs.data`, use [`fromJSON()`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson).\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo see additional debug logs, create a secret with the name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and value `true`.\n\n## How it works\n\n`octokit/graphql-action` is using [`@octokit/graphql`](https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js/) internally with the addition\nthat requests are automatically authenticated using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. It is required to prevent rate limiting, as all anonymous requests from the same origin count against the same low rate.\n\nThe actions sets `data` output to the response data. Note that it is a string, you should use [`fromJSON()`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson) to access any value of the response. The action also sets `headers` (again, to a JSON string) and `status`.\n\n## Preview Media Types\n\nNew features of graphql require the use of an Accept header with a preview media-type.\nThis is supported with a `mediaType` property, e.g.\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - uses: octokit/graphql-action@v2.x\n    with:\n      query: |\n        query  pullRequest(\n          $repo:String!\n          $owner:String!) {\n          repository(name:$repo, owner:$owner) { \n            pullRequests(last:1) {\n              nodes {\n                number\n                mergeStateStatus\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      owner: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.name }}\n      repo: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}\n      mediaType: |\n        previews:\n        - merge-info\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Input variables\n\nIt\'s important to remark `input variables` are converted to lowercase at runtime. This happens with GitHub Actions by design[^1].\n\n### Example\n\nIn the following example, the variable `itemId` is casted to `itemid` so, when trying to use it in the `query`, the execution will fail because of a missing variable: `itemId`\n\n```graphql\nquery release($itemId: String!) {\n  ...\n\n# Fails with ""Error: Variable $itemId of type String! was provided invalid value""\nitemId: ""randomId""\n```\n\nThe recommendation[^1] is to use variables in lowercase to avoid this kind of problems:\n\n```graphql\n# The variable name must be lower-case:\nquery release($itemid: String!) {\n  ...\n\n# Both: in the query and action var declaration:\nitemid: ""randomId""\n```\n\n[^1]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#inputs\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn\'t already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work. If you intend to make multiple deployments in quick succession [you may need to leverage the concurrency parameter in your workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency) to prevent overlaps.\n\nYou can view an example of this below.\n\n```yml\nname: Build and Deploy\non: [push]\npermissions:\n  contents: write\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }} # Recommended if you intend to make multiple deployments in quick succession.\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.\n        run: |\n          npm ci\n          npm run build\n\n      - name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4\n        with:\n          folder: build # The folder the action should deploy.\n```\n\nIf you\'d like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.\n\n```yml\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n```\n\n> **Warning**\n> If you do not supply the action with an access token or an SSH key, you must access your repositories settings and provide `Read and Write Permissions` to the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`, otherwise you\'ll potentially run into permission issues. Alternatively you can set the following in your workflow file to grant the action the permissions it needs.\n\n```yml\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n```\n\n## Configuration \xf0\x9f\x93\x81\n\nThe `with` portion of the workflow **must** be configured before the action will work. You can add these in the `with` section found in the examples above. Any `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repository\'s `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets).\n\n#### Required Setup\n\nThe following options must be configured in order to make a deployment.\n\n| Key      | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Type   | Required |\n| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |\n| `folder` | The folder in your repository that you want to deploy. If your build script compiles into a directory named `build` you\'d put it here. If you wish to deploy the root directory you can place a `.` here. You can also utilize absolute file paths by prepending `~` to your folder path. | `with` | **Yes**  |\n\nBy default, the action does not need any token configuration and uses the provided repository scoped GitHub token to make the deployment. If you require more customization you can modify the deployment type using the following options.\n\n| Key       | Value Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Type   | Required |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- |\n| `token`   | This option defaults to the repository scoped GitHub Token. However, if you need more permissions for things such as deploying to another repository, you can add a Personal Access Token (PAT) here. This should be stored in the `secrets / with` menu **as a secret**. We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary and recommend when generating a new PAT that you select the least permission scopes necessary.

If this is not included it will use the name in the GitHub context, followed by the name of the action.                                                                                                                                              | `with` | **No**   |\n| `git-config-email` | Allows you to customize the email that is attached to the git config which is used when pushing the deployment commits. If this is not included it will use the email in the GitHub context, followed by a generic noreply GitHub email. You can include `<>` for the value if you wish to omit this field altogether and push the commits without an email.                | `with` | **No**   |\n| `repository-name`  | Allows you to specify a different repository path so long as you have permissions to push to it. This should be formatted like so: `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`. You\'ll need to use a PAT in the `token` input for this configuration option to work properly.                                                                                                    | `with` | **No**   |\n| `target-folder`    | If you\'d like to push the contents of the deployment folder into a specific directory on the deployment branch you can specify it here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `with` | **No**   |\n| `commit-message`   | If you need to customize the commit message for an integration you can do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `with` | **No**   |\n| `clean`            | You can use this option to delete files from your deployment destination that no longer exist in your deployment source. One use case is if your project generates hashed files that vary from build to build. Using `clean` will not affect `.git`, `.github`, or `.ssh` directories. This option is turned on by default and can be toggled off by setting it to `false`. | `with` | **No**   |\n| `clean-exclude`    | If you need to use `clean` but you\'d like to preserve certain files or folders you can use this option. This should contain each pattern as a single line in a multiline string.                                                                                                                                                                                            | `with` | **No**   |\n| `dry-run`          | Do not actually push back, but use `--dry-run` on `git push` invocations instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |\n| `single-commit`    | This option can be toggled to `true` if you\'d prefer to have a single commit on the deployment branch instead of maintaining the full history. **Using this option will also cause any existing history to be wiped from the deployment branch**.                                                                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |\n| `force`            | Force-push new deployments to overwrite the previous version; otherwise, attempt to rebase new deployments onto any existing ones. This option is turned on by default and can be toggled off by setting it to `false`, which may be useful if there are multiple deployments in a single branch.                                                                           | `with` | **No**   |\n| `silent`           | Silences the action output preventing it from displaying git messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `with` | **No**   |\n| `tag`              | Add a tag to the commit.

You can find an explanation of each status type below.\n\n| Status    | Description                                                                                     |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `success` | The `success` status indicates that the action was able to successfully deploy to the branch.   |\n| `failed`  | The `failed` status indicates that the action encountered an error while trying to deploy.      |\n| `skipped` | The `skipped` status indicates that the action exited early as there was nothing new to deploy. |\n\nThis value is also set as a step output as `deployment-status`.\n\n---\n\n### Using an SSH Deploy Key \xf0\x9f\x94\x91\n\nIf you\'d prefer to use an SSH deploy key as opposed to a token you must first generate a new SSH key by running the following terminal command, replacing the email with one connected to your GitHub account.\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -m pem -b 4096 -C ""youremailhere@example.com"" -N """"\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve generated the key pair you must add the contents of the public key within your repository\'s [deploy keys menu](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/). You can find this option by going to `Settings > Deploy Keys`, you can name the public key whatever you want, but you **do** need to give it write access. Afterwards, add the contents of the private key to the `Settings > Secrets` menu as `DEPLOY_KEY`.\n\nWith this configured, you can then set the `ssh-key` part of the action to your private key stored as a secret.\n\n```yml\n- name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n  uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4\n  with:\n    folder: site\n    ssh-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n```\n\n<details><summary>You can view a full example of this here.</summary>\n<p>\n\n```yml\nname: Build and Deploy\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.\n        run: |\n          npm ci\n          npm run build\n\n      - name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4\n        with:\n          folder: build\n          clean: true\n          clean-exclude: |\n            special-file.txt\n            some/*.txt\n          ssh-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\nAlternatively, if you\'ve already configured the SSH client within a previous step you can set the `ssh-key` option to `true` to allow it to deploy using an existing SSH client. Instead of adjusting the client configuration, it will simply switch to using GitHub\'s SSH endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### Operating System Support \xf0\x9f\x92\xbf\n\nThis action is primarily developed using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). [In your workflow job configuration](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) it\'s recommended to set the `runs-on` property to `ubuntu-latest`.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  build-and-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n```\n\nIf you\'re using an operating system such as [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) you can workaround this using [artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts). In your workflow configuration you can utilize the `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions to move your project built on a Windows job to a secondary job that will handle the deployment.\n\n<details><summary>You can view an example of this pattern here.</summary>\n<p>\n\n```yml\nname: Build and Deploy\non: [push]\npermissions:\n  contents: write\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: windows-latest # The first job utilizes windows-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder.

Even though our project builds into the \'build\' folder the artifact name of \'site\' must be placed here.\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Using a Container \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa2\n\nIf you use a [container](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) in your workflow you may need to run an additional step to install `rsync` as this action depends on it. You can view an example of this below.\n\n```yml\n- name: Install rsync \xf0\x9f\x93\x9a\n  run: |\n    apt-get update && apt-get install -y rsync\n\n- name: Deploy \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80\n  uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4\n```\n\n---\n\n### Additional Build Files \xf0\x9f\x93\x81\n\nIf you\'re using a custom domain and require a `CNAME` file, or if you require the use of a `.nojekyll` file, you can safely commit these files directly into the deployment branch without them being overridden after each deployment, additionally, you can include these files in your deployment folder to update them. If you need to add additional files to the deployment that should be ignored by the build clean-up steps you can utilize the `clean-exclude` option.\n\n<details><summary>Click here to view an example of this.</summary>\n<p>\n\n```yml\nname: Build and Deploy\npermissions:\n  contents: write\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout \xf0\x9f\x9b\x8e\xef\xb8\x8f\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Install and Build \xf0\x9f\x94\xa7 # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the \'build\' folder.

If a version is not found locally, it will pull it from\nthe `main` branch of the [go-versions](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json)\nrepository. On miss or failure, it will fall back to downloading directly\nfrom [go dist](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang). To change the default behavior, please use\nthe [check-latest input](#check-latest-version).\n\n**Note:** The `setup-go` action uses executable binaries which are built by Golang side. The action does not build\ngolang from source code.\n\nMatching by [semver spec](https://github.com/npm/node-semver):\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'^1.13.1\' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.\n  - run: go version\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'>=1.17.0\'\n  - run: go version\n```\n\n> **Note**: Due to the peculiarities of YAML parsing, it is recommended to wrap the version in single quotation marks:\n> \n> ```yaml\n>   go-version: \'1.20\'\n>  ```\n>  \n> The recommendation is based on the YAML parser\'s behavior, which interprets non-wrapped values as numbers and, in the case of version 1.20, trims it down to 1.2, which may not be very obvious.\nMatching an unstable pre-release:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'1.18.0-rc.1\' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.\n  - run: go version\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'1.16.0-beta.1\' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.\n  - run: go version\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n## Basic\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'1.16.1\' # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use.\n  - run: go run hello.go\n```\n\n## Check latest version\n\nThe `check-latest` flag defaults to `false`. Use the default or set `check-latest` to `false` if you prefer stability\nand if you want to ensure a specific Go version is always used.\n\nIf `check-latest` is set to `true`, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally\ncached version is not the most up-to-date, a Go version will then be downloaded. Set `check-latest` to `true` if you\nwant the most up-to-date Go version to always be used.\n\n> Setting `check-latest` to `true` has performance implications as downloading Go versions is slower than using cached\n> versions.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'1.14\'\n      check-latest: true\n  - run: go run hello.go\n```\n\n## Using stable/oldstable aliases\n\nIf `stable` is provided, action will get the latest stable version from\nthe [`go-versions`](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json) repository manifest.\n\nIf `oldstable` is provided, when current release is 1.19.x, action will resolve version as 1.18.x, where x is the latest\npatch release.\n\n**Note:** using these aliases will result in same version as using corresponding minor release with `check-latest` input\nset to `true`\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'stable\'\n  - run: go run hello.go\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'oldstable\'\n  - run: go run hello.go\n```\n\n## Caching dependency files and build outputs:\n\nThe action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring go modules and build outputs. It\nuses [toolkit/cache](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) under the hood but requires less configuration settings.\nThe `cache` input is optional, and caching is turned on by default.\n\nThe action defaults to search for the dependency file - go.sum in the repository root, and uses its hash as a part of\nthe cache key. Use `cache-dependency-path` input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located\nin different subdirectories.\n\nIf some problem that prevents success caching happens then the action issues the warning in the log and continues the execution of the pipeline. \n\n**Caching in monorepos**\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version: \'1.17\'\n      check-latest: true\n      cache-dependency-path: subdir/go.sum\n  - run: go run hello.go\n  ```\n\n## Getting go version from the go.mod file\n\nThe `go-version-file` input accepts a path to a `go.mod` file or a `go.work` file that contains the version of Go to be\nused by a project. As the `go.mod` file contains only major and minor (e.g. 1.18) tags, the action will search for the\nlatest available patch version sequentially in the runner\'s directory with the cached tools, in\nthe [versions-manifest.json](https://github.com/actions/go-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json) file or at the go\nservers.\n\nIf both the `go-version` and the `go-version-file` inputs are provided then the `go-version` input is used.\n> The action will search for the `go.mod` file relative to the repository root\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n    with:\n      go-version-file: \'path/to/go.mod\'\n  - run: go version\n```\n\n## Matrix testing\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        go: [ \'1.14\', \'1.13\' ]\n    name: Go ${{ matrix.go }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Setup go\n        uses: actions/setup-go@v4\n        with:\n          go-version: ${{ matrix.go }}\n      - run: go run hello.go\n```\n\n### Supported version syntax\n\nThe `go-version` input supports the following syntax:\n\n- Specific versions: `1.15`, `1.16.1`, `1.17.0-rc.2`, `1.16.0-beta.1`\n- SemVer\'s version range syntax: `^1.13.1`, `>=1.18.0-rc.1`\n\nFor more information about semantic versioning, please refer to [semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver)\ndocumentation.\n\n## Using `setup-go` on GHES\n\n`setup-go` comes pre-installed on the appliance with GHES if Actions is enabled. When dynamically downloading Go\ndistributions, `setup-go` downloads distributions from [`actions/go-versions`](https://github.com/actions/go-versions)\non github.com (outside of the appliance). These calls to `actions/go-versions` are made via unauthenticated requests,\nwhich are limited\nto [60 requests per hour per IP](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If\nmore requests are made within the time frame, then you will start to see rate-limit errors during downloading that looks\nlike: `##[error]API rate limit exceeded for...`. After that error the action will try to download versions directly\nfrom https://storage.googleapis.com/golang, but it also can have rate limit so it\'s better to put token.\n\nTo get a higher rate limit, you\ncan [generate a personal access token on github.com](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and pass it as the `token`\ninput for the action:\n\n```yaml\nuses: actions/setup-go@v4\nwith:\n  token: ${{ secrets.GH_DOTCOM_TOKEN }}\n  go-version: \'1.18\'\n```\n\nIf the runner is not able to access github.com, any Go versions requested during a workflow run must come from the\nrunner\'s tool cache.\nSee ""[Setting up the tool cache on self-hosted runners without internet access](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)""\nfor more information.\n\n# License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n# Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

You don\'t need to add the repo to Coveralls first, it will be created when receiving the post.\n\nWhen running on `pull_request` events, a comment will be added to the PR with details about how coverage will be affected if merged.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe action\'s step needs to run after your test suite has outputted an LCOV file. Most major test runners can be configured to do so; if you\'re using Node, see more info [here](https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls).\n\n### Inputs:\n\n| Name                  | Requirement | Description |\n| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| `github-token`        | _required_ | Default if not specified: `${{ github.token }}`. Can be also specified this way: `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`; Coveralls uses this token to verify the appropriate repo at Coveralls and send any new status updates based on your coverage results. This variable is built into Github Actions, so __do not add it to your secrets store__. [More Info](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token)|\n| `file`        | _optional_ | Default: all coverage files that could be found. Local path to the coverage report file produced by your test suite. An error will be thrown if no file was found. This is the file that will be sent to the Coveralls API. Leave empty if you want to combine many files reports. |\n| `files`       | _optional_ | Default: all coverage files that could be found. Space-separated list of coverage report files produced by your test suite. Example: `files: coverage/test1.lcov coverage/test2.lcov` |\n| `format`              | _optional_ | Force coverage report file format. If not specified, coveralls will try to detect the format based on file extension and/or content. Possible values: `lcov`, `simplecov`, `cobertura`, `jacoco`, `gcov`, `golang`, `python`. See also [actual supported coverage report formats list](https://github.com/coverallsapp/coverage-reporter#supported-coverage-report-formats). |\n| `flag-name`           | _optional (unique required if parallel)_ | Job flag name, e.g. ""Unit"", ""Functional"", or ""Integration"". Will be shown in the Coveralls UI. |\n| `parallel`            | _optional_ | Set to true for parallel (or matrix) based steps, where multiple posts to Coveralls will be performed in the check. `flag-name` needs to be set and unique, e.g. `flag-name: run ${{ join(matrix.*, \' - \') }}` |\n| `parallel-finished`   | _optional_ | Set to true in the last job, after the other parallel jobs steps have completed, this will send a webhook to Coveralls to set the build complete. |\n| `carryforward`        | _optional_ | Comma separated flags used to carryforward results from previous builds if some of the parallel jobs are missing. Used only with `parallel-finished`. |\n| `coveralls-endpoint`  | _optional_ | Hostname and protocol: `https://<host>`; Specifies a [Coveralls Enterprise](https://enterprise.coveralls.io/) hostname. |\n| `allow-empty`         | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Don\'t fail if coverage report is empty or contains no coverage data. |\n| `base-path`           | _optional_ | Path to the root folder of the project the coverage was collected in. Should be used in monorepos so that coveralls can process the LCOV correctly (e.g. packages/my-project) |\n| `git-branch`          | _optional_ | Default: GITHUB_REF environment variable. Override the branch name. |\n| `git-commit`          | _optional_ | Default: GITHUB_SHA environment variable. Override the commit SHA. |\n| `compare-ref`         | _optional_ | Branch name to compare coverage with. Specify if you want to always check coverage change for PRs against one branch. |\n| `compare-sha`         | _optional_ | Commit SHA to compare coverage with. |\n| `debug`               | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to enable debug logging. |\n| `measure`             | _optional_ | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to enable time time measurement logging. |\n| `fail-on-error`       | _optional_ | Default: `true`. Set to `false` to avoid CI failure when upload fails due to any errors. |\n\n### Outputs:\n\n* `coveralls-api-result`: JSON response from the Coveralls API with a status code and url for the Job on Coveralls.\n\n### Standard Example:\n\n* This example assumes you\'re building a Node project using the command `make test-coverage`, demo here: [nickmerwin/node-coveralls](https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls)\n\n```yaml\non: [""push"", ""pull_request""]\n\nname: Test Coveralls\n\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    name: Build\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n\n    - name: Use Node.js 16.x\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      with:\n        node-version: 16.x\n\n    - name: npm install, make test-coverage\n      run: |\n        npm install\n        make test-coverage\n\n    - name: Coveralls\n      uses: coverallsapp/github-action@v2\n```\n\n### Complete Parallel Job Example:\n\n```yaml\non: [""push"", ""pull_request""]\n\nname: Test Coveralls Parallel\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        test_number:\n          - 1\n          - 2\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@3\n    - name: Use Node.js 16.x\n      uses: actions/setup-node@3\n      with:\n        node-version: 16.x\n\n    - name: npm install\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Test ${{ matrix.test_number }}\n      run: make test-coverage-${{ matrix.test_number }}\n    - name: Coveralls Parallel\n      uses: coverallsapp/github-action@v2\n      with:\n        flag-name: run-${{ join(matrix.*, \'-\') }}\n        parallel: true\n\n  finish:\n    needs: test\n    if: ${{ always() }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Coveralls Finished\n      uses: coverallsapp/github-action@v2\n      with:\n        parallel-finished: true\n        carryforward: ""run-1,run-2""\n```\n\nThe ""Coveralls Finished"" step needs to run after all other steps have completed; it will let Coveralls know that all jobs in the build are done and aggregate coverage calculation can be calculated and notifications sent.\n\n## Demo\n\n![demo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coveralls.io/Coveralls%20Github%20Action%20Demo%20-%20trimmed%20-%204.8x720.gif)\n\n### Steps shown:\n\n1. A new function `f` without test coverage is added.\n2. The changes are committed and pushed to a new branch ""function/f""\n3. The workflow runs on GitHub Actions.\n4. The commit on GitHub shows a new check for Coveralls with details ""First build on function-f at 92.0%"", and links to the Job on Coveralls.\n5. Line-by-line results indicate the new function is missing coverage.\n6. Create a pull request with the new branch.\n7. The `pull_request` check runs and the resulting coverage data triggers a `fail` status.\n8. A detailed comment is posted.\n\n## Troubleshooting:\n\n### Coveralls comments aren\'t added to my pull request\n\nEnsure that:\n\n1. Your workflow invokes the Coveralls action runs on pull requests, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\non: [""push"", ""pull_request""]\n```\n\n2. You have invited the [@coveralls](https://github.com/coveralls) user to your repository with `Role: Write`\n3. You have enabled the ""LEAVE COMMENTS?"" setting in the ""Pull Request Alerts"" area in your Repo Settings page inside the Coveralls app.\n\n### Coveralls responds with ""cannot find matching repository""\n\nEnsure your workflow yaml line for the GitHub token matches *exactly*:\n\n```yaml\ngithub-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n---\n\n## [MIT License](LICENSE.md)\n\n## [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

See examples below. |\n| `prefix`            | `undefined`     | See [`--prefix`](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-test-coverage)      |\n| `verifyDownload`    | `true`          | Verifies the downloaded Code Climate reporter binary\'s checksum and GPG signature. See [Verifying binaries](https://github.com/codeclimate/test-reporter#verifying-binaries)      |\n\n> **Note**\n> If you are a Ruby developer using [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov), other users have recommended installing an additional gem \xe2\x80\x93 `gem ""simplecov_json_formatter""` \xe2\x80\x93 this gem fixes `json` error from the default `coverage/.resultset.json` output from SimpleCov.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Test & publish code coverage\n    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v5.0.0\n    env:\n      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: <code_climate_reporter_id>\n    with:\n      coverageCommand: npm run coverage\n      debug: true\n```\n\n#### Example with only upload\n\nWhen you\'ve already generated the coverage report in a previous step and wish to just upload the coverage data to Code Climate, you can leave out the `coverageCommand` option.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Test & publish code coverage\n    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v5.0.0\n    env:\n      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: <code_climate_reporter_id>\n```\n\n#### Example with wildcard (glob) pattern\n\nThis action supports basic glob patterns to search for files matching given patterns. It uses [`@actions/glob`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/glob#basic) to expand the glob patterns.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Test & publish code coverage\n    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v5.0.0\n    env:\n      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: <code_climate_reporter_id>\n    with:\n      coverageCommand: yarn run coverage\n      coverageLocations: |\n        ${{github.workspace}}/*.lcov:lcov\n```\n\n#### Example with Jacoco\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Test & publish code coverage\n    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v5.0.0\n    env:\n      # Set CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID as secret of your repo\n      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: ${{secrets.CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID}}\n      JACOCO_SOURCE_PATH: ""${{github.workspace}}/src/main/java""\n    with:\n      # The report file must be there, otherwise Code Climate won\'t find it\n      coverageCommand: mvn test\n      coverageLocations: ${{github.workspace}}/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml:jacoco\n```\n\n#### Example of multiple test coverages for monorepo with Jest\n\nLet\'s say you have a monorepo with two folders \xe2\x80\x94`client` and `server`, both with their own coverage folders and a `yarn coverage` script which runs Jest within both folders.\n\n```json\n""scripts"": {\n  ""coverage"": ""yarn client coverage && yarn server coverage""\n}\n```\n\nFirst be sure that paths in your `coverage/lcov.info` are correct; they should be either absolute or relative to the **root** of the monorepo. Open `lcov.info` and search for any path. For example \xe2\x80\x94\n\n```lcov\nSF:src/server.ts\n```\n\nIf you find a *relative* path like this (happens for Jest 25+), it\'s incorrect as it is relative to the sub-package. This can be fixed by configuring Jest to set the root of your monorepo \xe2\x80\x94\n\n```javascript\n// server/jest.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...\n  coverageReporters: [[\'lcov\', { projectRoot: \'..\' }]]\n  ...\n};\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Test & publish code coverage\n    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v5.0.0\n    env:\n      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: ${{secrets.CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID}}\n    with:\n      coverageCommand: yarn run coverage\n      coverageLocations: |\n        ${{github.workspace}}/client/coverage/lcov.info:lcov\n        ${{github.workspace}}/server/coverage/lcov.info:lcov\n```\n\nExample projects\n\n1.

Built with <a href=""https://github.com/probot/probot"">Probot</a>.</p>\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:\n\n```yaml\nname: Release Drafter\n\non:\n  push:\n    # branches to consider in the event; optional, defaults to all\n    branches:\n      - master\n  # pull_request event is required only for autolabeler\n  pull_request:\n    # Only following types are handled by the action, but one can default to all as well\n    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n  # pull_request_target event is required for autolabeler to support PRs from forks\n  # pull_request_target:\n  #   types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n\njobs:\n  update_release_draft:\n    permissions:\n      # write permission is required to create a github release\n      contents: write\n      # write permission is required for autolabeler\n      # otherwise, read permission is required at least\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      # (Optional) GitHub Enterprise requires GHE_HOST variable set\n      #- name: Set GHE_HOST\n      #  run: |\n      #    echo ""GHE_HOST=${GITHUB_SERVER_URL##https:\\/\\/}"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n\n      # Drafts your next Release notes as Pull Requests are merged into ""master""\n      - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5\n        # (Optional) specify config name to use, relative to .github/. Default: release-drafter.yml\n        # with:\n        #   config-name: my-config.yml\n        #   disable-autolabeler: true\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nIf you\'re unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.\n\n## Configuration\n\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository. The configuration file **must** reside in your default branch, no other configurations will be accepted.\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:\n\n```yml\ntemplate: |\n  ## What\xe2\x80\x99s Changed\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\nAs pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />\n\nThe following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:\n\n```yml\nname-template: \'v$RESOLVED_VERSION \xf0\x9f\x8c\x88\'\ntag-template: \'v$RESOLVED_VERSION\'\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    labels:\n      - \'feature\'\n      - \'enhancement\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\xa7\xb0 Maintenance\'\n    label: \'chore\'\nchange-template: \'- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)\'\nchange-title-escapes: \'\\<*_&\' # You can add # and @ to disable mentions, and add ` to disable code blocks.\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - \'major\'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - \'minor\'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - \'patch\'\n  default: patch\ntemplate: |\n  ## Changes\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nYou can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n| Key                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `template`                 | Required | The template for the body of the draft release.

For matching tags, this prefix is stripped before attempting to parse the version. Default: `""""`                                       |\n| `version-template`         | Optional | The template to use when calculating the next version number for the release. Useful for projects that don\'t use semantic versioning. Default: `""$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH""`            |\n| `change-template`          | Optional | The template to use for each merged pull request. Use [change template variables](#change-template-variables) to insert values.

Refer to [Version Resolver](#version-resolver) to learn more about this.                      |\n\n## Version Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:\n\n| Variable    | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `$PATCH`    | The patch version number.                                    |\n| `$MINOR`    | The minor version number.                                    |\n| `$MAJOR`    | The major version number.                                    |\n| `$COMPLETE` | The complete version string (including any prerelease info). |\n\n## Version Resolver\n\nWith the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - \'major\'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - \'minor\'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - \'patch\'\n  default: patch\n```\n\nThe above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.\n\nIf a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.\n\n## Change Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:\n\n| Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NUMBER`        | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `$TITLE`         | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. Any characters excluding @ and # matching `change-title-escapes` will be prepended with a backslash so that they will appear verbatim instead of being interpreted as markdown format characters. @s and #s if present in `change-title-escapes` will be appended with an HTML comment so that they don\'t become mentions. |\n| `$AUTHOR`        | The pull request author\xe2\x80\x99s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| `$BODY`          | The body of the pull request e.g. `Fixed spelling mistake`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$URL`           | The URL of the pull request e.g. `https://github.com/octocat/repo/pull/42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$BASE_REF_NAME` | The base name of of the base Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `master`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `$HEAD_REF_NAME` | The head name of the head Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `my-bug-fix`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## References\n\n**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)\n\nReferences takes an list and accepts strings and regex.\nIf none are specified, we default to the repository\xe2\x80\x99s default branch usually master.\n\n```yaml\nreferences:\n  - master\n  - v.+\n```\n\nCurrently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene\n\n## Categorize Pull Requests\n\nWith the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    label: \'feature\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />\n\nAdding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using the embedded Autolabeler functionality (see below),\n[PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).\n\nOptionally you can add a `collapse-after` entry to your category item, if the category has more than the defined `collapse-after` pull requests then it will show all pull requests collapsed for that category. Append the `collapse-after` integer to your category as following:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f Dependencies\'\n    collapse-after: 3\n    labels:\n      - \'dependencies\'\n```\n\n## Exclude Pull Requests\n\nWith the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nexclude-labels:\n  - \'skip-changelog\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.\n\n## Include Pull Requests\n\nWith the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ninclude-labels:\n  - \'app-foo\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""app-foo"" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.\n\n## Exclude Contributors\n\nBy default, the `$CONTRIBUTORS` variable will contain the names or usernames of all the contributors of a release. The `exclude-contributors` option allows you to remove certain usernames from that list. This can be useful if don\'t wish to include yourself, to better highlight only the third-party contributions.\n\n```yml\nexclude-contributors:\n  - \'myusername\'\n```\n\n## Replacers\n\nYou can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.\n\n```yml\nreplacers:\n  - search: \'/CVE-(\\d{4})-(\\d+)/g\'\n    replace: \'https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-$1-$2\'\n  - search: \'myname\'\n    replace: \'My Name\'\n```\n\n## Autolabeler\n\nYou can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).\nMatchers are evaluated independently; the label will be set if at least one of the matchers meets the criteria.\n\n```yml\nautolabeler:\n  - label: \'chore\'\n    files:\n      - \'*.md\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/docs{0,1}\\/.+/\'\n  - label: \'bug\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/fix\\/.+/\'\n    title:\n      - \'/fix/i\'\n  - label: \'enhancement\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/feature\\/.+/\'\n    body:\n      - \'/JIRA-[0-9]{1,4}/\'\n```\n\n## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning\n\nIf your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.\n\nFor example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.\n\n## Action Inputs\n\nThe Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.\n\n| Input         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `config-name` | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that\'s where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `name`        | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `name-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `tag`         | The tag name to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `tag-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `version`     | The version to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any version calculated by the release-drafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `publish`     | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |\n| `prerelease`  | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated is a prerelease.

                               |\n| `header`      | A string that would be added before the template body.

     |\n| `footer`      | A string that would be added after the template body.

Outputs\n\nThe Release Drafter GitHub Action sets a couple of outputs which can be used as inputs to other Actions in the workflow ([example](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset)).\n\n| Output       | Description

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`         | The ID of the release that was created or updated.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `name`       | The name of this release.

included in files.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `html_url`   | The URL users can navigate to in order to view the release. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/v1.0.0`.                                                                                                    |\n| `upload_url` | The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could be used by GitHub Actions for additional uses, for example the [`@actions/upload-release-asset GitHub Action`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset). |\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nyarn install\n\n# Run the tests\nyarn test\n\n# Run the app locally\nyarn test:watch\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):\n\n```sh\n# Run the tests\ndocker compose run --rm app\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThird-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nIf you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.\n\n## Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).\n\n## Releasing\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]\n```\n\nThe command does the following:\n\n- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes\n- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch\n- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:\n  - Runs test\n  - Pushes the tag to GitHub, which triggers GitHub Action that does the following:\n    - Push GitHub app to Heroku\n    - Releases NPM\n    - Publish the Release Draft!\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

You also will need to have a release to upload your asset to, which could be created programmatically by [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) as show in the example workflow.\n\n### Inputs\nFor more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input-2)\n\n- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could come from another GitHub Action, for example the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) GitHub Action\n\n### Outputs\nFor more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-for-successful-upload) for an example of what these outputs look like\n\n- `id`: The ID of the asset\n- `browser_download_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to download the release asset. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/download/v1.0.0/example.zip`\n\n### Example workflow - upload a release asset\nOn every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) and [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset). This Workflow example assumes you have the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) Action in a previous step:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags\n    tags:\n    - \'v*\' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10\n\nname: Upload Release Asset\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Upload Release Asset\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Build project # This would actually build your project, using zip for an example artifact\n        run: |\n          zip --junk-paths my-artifact README.md\n      - name: Create Release\n        id: create_release\n        uses: actions/create-release@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        with:\n          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}\n          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}\n          draft: false\n          prerelease: false\n      - name: Upload Release Asset\n        id: upload-release-asset \n        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        with:\n          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }} # This pulls from the CREATE RELEASE step above, referencing it\'s ID to get its outputs object, which include a `upload_url`. See this blog post for more info: https://jasonet.co/posts/new-features-of-github-actions/#passing-data-to-future-steps \n          asset_path: ./my-artifact.zip\n          asset_name: my-artifact.zip\n          asset_content_type: application/zip\n```\n\nThis will upload a release artifact to an existing release, outputting the `browser_download_url` for the asset which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses. For more information, see the GitHub Documentation for the [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) endpoint. \n\n## Contributing\nWe would love you to contribute to `@actions/upload-release-asset`, pull requests are welcome!

54,"b'# Download workflow artifact GitHub Action\n\nAn action that downloads and extracts uploaded artifacts associated with a given workflow and commit or other criteria.\n\nLet\'s suppose you have a workflow with a job in it that at the end uploads an artifact using `actions/upload-artifact` action and you want to download this artifact in another workflow that is run after the first one. Official `actions/download-artifact` does not allow this. That\'s why I decided to create this action. By knowing only the workflow name and commit SHA or other details, you can download the previously uploaded artifact from different workflow associated with that commit or other criteria and use it.\n\n## Usage\n\n> If `commit` or `pr` or `branch` or `run_id` or `workflow_conclusion` is not specified then the artifact from the most recent successfully completed workflow run will be downloaded.\n\n**Do not specify `pr`, `commit`, `branch`, `run_id` together or `workflow_conclusion` and `run_id` together. Pick just one of each or none.**\n\n```yaml\n- name: Download artifact\n  id: download-artifact\n  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2\n  with:\n    # Optional, GitHub token, a Personal Access Token with `public_repo` scope if needed\n    # Required, if the artifact is from a different repo\n    # Required, if the repo is private a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope is needed or GitHub token in a job where the permissions `action` scope set to `read`\n    github_token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}\n    # Optional, workflow file name or ID\n    # If not specified, will be inferred from run_id (if run_id is specified), or will be the current workflow\n    workflow: workflow_name.yml\n    # Optional, the status or conclusion of a completed workflow to search for\n    # Can be one of a workflow conclusion:\n    #   ""failure"", ""success"", ""neutral"", ""cancelled"", ""skipped"", ""timed_out"", ""action_required""\n    # Or a workflow status:\n    #   ""completed"", ""in_progress"", ""queued""\n    # Use the empty string ("""") to ignore status or conclusion in the search\n    workflow_conclusion: success\n    # Optional, will get head commit SHA\n    pr: ${{github.event.pull_request.number}}\n    # Optional, no need to specify if PR is\n    commit: ${{github.event.pull_request.head.sha}}\n    # Optional, will use the specified branch.

57,"b'# Github Action - CI bot\n\nThis GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), \nto allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to rerun you failure checks in PR.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory.

If for\n  some reason you need the non-wrapped `require`, there is an escape hatch\n  available: `__original_require__` is the original value of `require` without\n  our wrapping applied.\n\nSince the `script` is just a function body, these values will already be\ndefined, so you don\'t have to import them (see examples below).\n\nSee [octokit/rest.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/) for the API client\ndocumentation.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Breaking changes in V6\n\nVersion 6 of this action updated the runtime to Node 16 - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-nodejs-v16\n\nAll scripts are now run with Node 16 instead of Node 12 and are affected by any breaking changes between Node 12 and 16.\n\n### Breaking changes in V5\n\nVersion 5 of this action includes the version 5 of `@actions/github` and `@octokit/plugin-rest-endpoint-methods`. As part of this update, the Octokit context available via `github` no longer has REST methods directly. These methods are available via `github.rest.*` - https://github.com/octokit/plugin-rest-endpoint-methods.js/releases/tag/v5.0.0\n\nFor example, `github.issues.createComment` in V4 becomes `github.rest.issues.createComment` in V5\n\n`github.request`, `github.paginate`, and `github.graphql` are unchanged.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [development.md](/docs/development.md).\n\n## Reading step results\n\nThe return value of the script will be in the step\'s outputs under the\n""result"" key.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  id: set-result\n  with:\n    script: return ""Hello!""\n    result-encoding: string\n- name: Get result\n  run: echo ""${{steps.set-result.outputs.result}}""\n```\n\nSee [""Result encoding""](#result-encoding) for details on how the encoding of\nthese outputs can be changed.\n\n## Result encoding\n\nBy default, the JSON-encoded return value of the function is set as the ""result"" in the\noutput of a github-script step. For some workflows, string encoding is preferred. This option can be set using the\n`result-encoding` input:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  id: my-script\n  with:\n    result-encoding: string\n    script: return ""I will be string (not JSON) encoded!""\n```\n\n## Retries\n\nBy default, requests made with the `github` instance will not be retried. You can configure this with the `retries` option:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  id: my-script\n  with:\n    result-encoding: string\n    retries: 3\n    script: |\n      github.rest.issues.get({\n        issue_number: context.issue.number,\n        owner: context.repo.owner,\n        repo: context.repo.repo,\n      })\n```\n\nIn this example, request failures from `github.rest.issues.get()` will be retried up to 3 times.\n\nYou can also configure which status codes should be exempt from retries via the `retry-exempt-status-codes` option:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  id: my-script\n  with:\n    result-encoding: string\n    retries: 3\n    retry-exempt-status-codes: 400,401\n    script: |\n      github.rest.issues.get({\n        issue_number: context.issue.number,\n        owner: context.repo.owner,\n        repo: context.repo.repo,\n      })\n```\n\nBy default, the following status codes will not be retried: `400, 401, 403, 404, 422` [(source)](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js/blob/9a2443746c350b3beedec35cf26e197ea318a261/src/index.ts#L14).\n\nThese retries are implemented using the [octokit/plugin-retry.js](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js) plugin. The retries use [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) to space out retries. ([source](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-retry.js/blob/9a2443746c350b3beedec35cf26e197ea318a261/src/error-request.ts#L13))\n\n## Examples\n\nNote that `github-token` is optional in this action, and the input is there\nin case you need to use a non-default token.\n\nBy default, github-script will use the token provided to your workflow.\n\n### Print the available attributes of context\n\n```yaml\n- name: View context attributes\n  uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  with:\n    script: console.log(context)\n```\n\n### Comment on an issue\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened]\n\njobs:\n  comment:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              body: \'\xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Thanks for reporting!\'\n            })\n```\n\n### Apply a label to an issue\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened]\n\njobs:\n  apply-label:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.addLabels({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              labels: [\'Triage\']\n            })\n```\n\n### Welcome a first-time contributor\n\nYou can format text in comments using the same [Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) as the GitHub web interface:\n\n```yaml\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  welcome:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            // Get a list of all issues created by the PR opener\n            // See: https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/#pagination\n            const creator = context.payload.sender.login\n            const opts = github.rest.issues.listForRepo.endpoint.merge({\n              ...context.issue,\n              creator,\n              state: \'all\'\n            })\n            const issues = await github.paginate(opts)\n\n            for (const issue of issues) {\n              if (issue.number === context.issue.number) {\n                continue\n              }\n\n              if (issue.pull_request) {\n                return // Creator is already a contributor.\n              }\n            }\n\n            await github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              body: `**Welcome**, new contributor!\n\n                Please make sure you\'ve read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and we look forward to reviewing your Pull request shortly \xe2\x9c\xa8`\n            })\n```\n\n### Download data from a URL\n\nYou can use the `github` object to access the Octokit API. For\ninstance, `github.request`\n\n```yaml\non: pull_request\n\njobs:\n  diff:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const diff_url = context.payload.pull_request.diff_url\n            const result = await github.request(diff_url)\n            console.log(result)\n```\n\n_(Note that this particular example only works for a public URL, where the\ndiff URL is publicly accessible. Getting the diff for a private URL requires\nusing the API.)_\n\nThis will print the full diff object in the screen; `result.data` will\ncontain the actual diff text.\n\n### Run custom GraphQL queries\n\nYou can use the `github.graphql` object to run custom GraphQL queries against the GitHub API.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  list-issues:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const query = `query($owner:String!, $name:String!, $label:String!) {\n              repository(owner:$owner, name:$name){\n                issues(first:100, labels: [$label]) {\n                  nodes {\n                    id\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }`;\n            const variables = {\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              name: context.repo.repo,\n              label: \'wontfix\'\n            }\n            const result = await github.graphql(query, variables)\n            console.log(result)\n```\n\n### Run a separate file\n\nIf you don\'t want to inline your entire script that you want to run, you can\nuse a separate JavaScript module in your repository like so:\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  echo-input:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const script = require(\'./path/to/script.js\')\n            console.log(script({github, context}))\n```\n\nAnd then export a function from your module:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = ({github, context}) => {\n  return context.payload.client_payload.value\n}\n```\n\nNote that because you can\'t `require` things like the GitHub context or\nActions Toolkit libraries, you\'ll want to pass them as arguments to your\nexternal function.\n\nAdditionally, you\'ll want to use the [checkout\naction](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to make sure your script file is\navailable.\n\n### Run a separate file with an async function\n\nYou can also use async functions in this manner, as long as you `await` it in\nthe inline script.\n\nIn your workflow:\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  echo-input:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        env:\n          SHA: \'${{env.parentSHA}}\'\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const script = require(\'./path/to/script.js\')\n            await script({github, context, core})\n```\n\nAnd then export an async function from your module:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = async ({github, context, core}) => {\n  const {SHA} = process.env\n  const commit = await github.rest.repos.getCommit({\n    owner: context.repo.owner,\n    repo: context.repo.repo,\n    ref: `${SHA}`\n  })\n  core.exportVariable(\'author\', commit.data.commit.author.email)\n}\n```\n\n### Use npm packages\n\nLike importing your own files above, you can also use installed modules.\nNote that this is achieved with a wrapper on top `require`, so if you\'re\ntrying to require a module inside your own file, you might need to import\nit externally or pass the `require` wrapper to your file:\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  echo-input:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 16\n      - run: npm ci\n      # or one-off:\n      - run: npm install execa\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const execa = require(\'execa\')\n\n            const { stdout } = await execa(\'echo\', [\'hello\', \'world\'])\n\n            console.log(stdout)\n```\n\n### Use ESM `import`\n\nTo import an ESM file, you\'ll need to reference your script by an absolute path and ensure you have a `package.json` file with `""type"": ""module""` specified.\n\nFor a script in your repository `src/print-stuff.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default function printStuff() {\n  console.log(\'stuff\')\n}\n```\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  print-stuff:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const { default: printStuff } = await import(\'${{ github.workspace }}/src/print-stuff.js\')\n\n            await printStuff()\n```\n\n### Use env as input\n\nYou can set env vars to use them in your script:\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  echo-input:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        env:\n          FIRST_NAME: Mona\n          LAST_NAME: Octocat\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const { FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME } = process.env\n\n            console.log(`Hello ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME}`)\n```\n\n### Using a separate GitHub token\n\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` used by default is scoped to the current repository, see [Authentication in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow).\n\nIf you need access to a different repository or an API that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn\'t have permissions to, you can provide your own [PAT](https://help.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) as a secret using the `github-token` input.\n\n[Learn more about creating and using encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened]\n\njobs:\n  apply-label:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -

uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: gradle/wrapper-validation-action@v1\n```\n\n## Contributing to an external GitHub Repository\n\nSince [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\nare completely free for open source projects and are automatically enabled on almost all projects,\nadding this check to a project\'s build is as simple as contributing a PR.\nEnabling the check requires no overhead on behalf of the project maintainer beyond merging the action.\n\nYou can add this action to your favorite Gradle based project without checking out their source locally via the\nGitHub Web UI thanks to the \'Create new file\' button.\n\n![GitHub \'Create new file\' Button bar picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1323708/73676469-6c023c00-4682-11ea-8c0a-5a1e2d29b17f.png)\n\nSimply add a new file named `.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml` with the contents mentioned above.\n\nWe recommend the message commit contents of:\n - Title: `Official Gradle Wrapper Validation Action`\n - Body (at minimum): `See: https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action`\n\nFrom there, you can easily follow the rest of the prompts to create a Pull Request against the project.\n\n## Reporting Failures\n\nIf this GitHub action fails because a `gradle-wrapper.jar` doesn\'t match one of our published SHA-256 checksums,\nwe highly recommend that you reach out to us at [security@gradle.com](mailto:security@gradle.com).\n\n**Note:** `gradle-wrapper.jar` generated by Gradle 3.3 to 4.0 are not verifiable because those files were dynamically generated by Gradle in a non-reproducible way. It\'s not possible to verify the `gradle-wrapper.jar` for those versions are legitimate using a hash comparison. You should try to determine if the `gradle-wrapper.jar` was generated by one of these versions before running the build.\n\nIf the Gradle version in `gradle-wrapper.properties` is out of this range, you may need to regenerate the `gradle-wrapper.jar` by running `./gradlew wrapper`. If you need to use a version of Gradle between 3.3 and 4.0, you can use a newer version of Gradle to generate the `gradle-wrapper.jar`.\n\nIf you\'re curious and want to explore what the differences are between the `gradle-wrapper.jar` in your possession\nand one of our valid release, you can compare them using this online utility: [diffoscope](https://try.diffoscope.org/).\nRegardless of what you find, we still kindly request that you reach out to us and let us know.\n\n## Resources\n\nTo learn more about verifying the Gradle Wrapper JAR locally, see our\n[guide on the topic](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#wrapper_checksum_verification).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
60,"b'# Gradle Cache Action\n\n[![CI Status](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/actions)\n![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/burrunan/gradle-cache-action?label=release)\n[![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.7.10-blue.svg?logo=kotlin)](http://kotlinlang.org)\n\nThis is a GitHub Action for caching Gradle caches.\nIn other words, this is [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) customized for Gradle.\n\nKey improvements over [@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) and [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action) are:\n- \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Gradle remote build cache backend (pulls only the needed entries from GitHub cache)\n- \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89 Support multiple remote caches via [gradle-multi-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-multi-cache) (e.g. GitHub Actions + S3)\n- \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Simplified configuration (action name + gradle command is enough for most case)\n- \xf0\x9f\x91\xbe Less space usage (GitHub imposes overall 5GiB limit by default, so cache space matters)\n- \xf0\x9f\x94\x97 Link to Build Scan in build results\n- \xf0\x9f\x92\xa1 Gradle build failure markers added to the diff view (e.g. `compileJava` or `compileKotlin` markers right in the commit diff)\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the following code to your workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory.\n\nNote: Like with [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action), you can\nspecify `gradle-version: release` to test with the current release version of Gradle, `gradle-version: nightly` for testing Gradle nightly builds,\nan so on (see `gradle-version` below).\n\nNote: For the [security reasons](https://julienrenaux.fr/2019/12/20/github-actions-security-risk/)\nyou might want to use Git SHA rather than branch name or tag name.\nIn other words, to avoid accidental tag update, you might want to use\n`burrunan/gradle-cache-action@03c71a8ba93d670980695505f48f49daf43704a6` rather than `burrunan/gradle-cache-action@v1`.\nPlease see releases page to find out the commit ids: https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/releases\n\nYou might use the following references are:\n* `v1` -- this is a *moving* qualifier. It points to the latest release among `v1.x`\n* `v1.0`, `v1.1`, ... -- those are fixed versions. They won\'t change over time\n\nFor the best security you might want to use `burrunan/gradle-cache-action@v1` (see the ids at https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/releases)\n\n```yaml\n- uses: burrunan/gradle-cache-action@v1\n  name: Build PROJECT_NAME\n  #

In other words, build scan would show virtually zero response times for\ncache save operations.\n\nIf your build already has a remote cache declared (e.g. you are using your own cache),\nthen `gradle-cache-action` would configure **both** remote caches.\nIt would read from the GitHub cache first, and it would save data to both caches.\n\nThe multi-cache feature can be disabled via `multi-cache-enabled: false`.\n\n## How to enable build scans?\n\n1.

Add `--scan` to `arguments:`, and add the following to `settings.gradle.kts`\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    `gradle-enterprise`\n}\n\nval isCiServer = System.getenv().containsKey(""CI"")\n\nif (isCiServer) {\n    gradleEnterprise {\n        buildScan {\n            termsOfServiceUrl = ""https://gradle.com/terms-of-service""\n            termsOfServiceAgree = ""yes""\n            tag(""CI"")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Why another action instead of gradle-command-action?\n\n`gradle-command-action` was started as a Kotlin/JS experiment for making a customized\n[@actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) that would make Gradle builds faster.\n\nThen it turned out there\'s a proxy remote cache requests to the `@actions/cache` API can be used when the caching\naction executes Gradle, so the `gradle-cache-action` got a Gradle execution feature.\n\nOf course, the same could have been made in [gradle-command-action](https://github.com/eskatos/gradle-command-action),\nhowever:\n- The author was not familiar with TypeScript ecosystem (stdlib, typical libraries, testing libraries, etc.)\n- Caching logic is collections-heavy, and Kotlin stdlib shines here.\n\n  For instance, in Kotlin `list + list` adds lists, and `array.associateWith { valueFor(it) }` converts arrays to maps.\n  This is easy to write without consulting StackOverflow, the code is readable, and it does not require\n  you [to fight with the compiler](https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2016/06/create-es2015-map-from-array-in-typescript.html).\n\n- A single language helps when building connected components.\n  `gradle-cache-action` integrates with [gradle-multi-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-multi-cache) and\n  [gradle-s3-build-cache](https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-s3-build-cache), and they all are Kotlin-based. \n\n## Can I use the caching part of the action only?\n\nYes, you can. If you omit `arguments:`, then the action runs in `cache-only` mode.\nIt won\'t launch Gradle.\n\n## Can I call multiple different Gradle builds in the same job?\n\nThis might be complicated, see https://github.com/burrunan/gradle-cache-action/issues/15.\n\nCurrently, the workaround is to configure `execution-only-caches: true` for all but one\n`gradle-cache-action` executions.\nThen one of the actions would do the cache save and restore, and the rest would use their own\ncaches only.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcome!

64,"b'# Label manager for PRs and issues based on configurable conditions\n\n[![labeler release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/srvaroa/labeler?sort=semver)](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases)  \n\nImplements an all-in-one [GitHub\nAction](https://help.github.com/en/categories/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions)\nthat can manage multiple labels for both Pull Requests and Issues using\nconfigurable matching rules. Available conditions:\n\n* [Author can merge](#author-can-merge): label based on whether the author can merge the PR\n* [Authors](#authors): label based on the PR/Issue authors\n* [Base branch](#base-branch): label based on the PR\'s base branch\n* [Body](#body): label based on the PR/Issue body\n* [Branch](#branch): label based on the PR branch\n* [Draft](#draft): label based on whether the branch is mergeable\n* [Files](#files): label based on the files modified in the PR\n* [Mergeable](#mergeable): label based o whether the PR is mergeable\n* [Size](#size): label based on the PR size\n* [Title](#title): label based on the PR/Issue title\n\n## Sponsors\n\nThanks to [Launchgood](https://github.com/launchgood) for sponsoring\nthis project.\n\nPlease consider supporting the project if your organization is finding\nit useful, you can do this through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/srvaroa).\n\n## Installing\n\nThe action is configured by adding a file `.github/labeler.yml`. The\nfile contains matching rules expanded in the `Configuration` section\nbelow.\n\nThe action will strive to maintain backwards compatibility with older\nconfiguration versions. It is nevertheless encouraged to update your\nconfiguration files to benefit from newer features. Please follow our\n[releases](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases) page to stay up\nto date.\n\n### GitHub Enterprise support\n\nAdd `GITHUB_API_HOST` to your env variables, it should be in the form\n`http(s)://[hostname]/`\n\nPlease consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/srvaroa) if you\'re using Labeler in your organization!\n\n### How to trigger action\n\nTo trigger the action on events, add a file `.github/workflows/main.yml`\nto your repository: \n\n```yaml\nname: Label PRs\n\non:\n- pull_request\n- issues\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: srvaroa/labeler@master\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n```\n\nUsing `@master` will run the latest available release. Feel free to pin\nthis to a specific version from the [releases\npage](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/releases).\n\nUse the [`on`\nclause](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)\nto control when to run it.\n\n* To trigger on PR events, [use\n  `pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request).\n  to trigger on PR events and run on the merge commit of the PR. Use\n  [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)\n  instead if you prefer to run on the base.\n* To trigger on issue events, add [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues).\n\nYou may combine multiple event triggers.\n\nA final option is to trigger the action periodically using the\n[`schedule`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)\ntrigger. For backwards compatibility reasons this will examine all\nactive pull requests and update their labels. If you wish to examine\nissues as well, you\'ll need to explicitly add the `issues` flag in your\nconfig file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nissues: True\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis action will avoid failing in all cases, so if you\'re experiencing\nunexpected behaviour it\'s worth looking at execution logs.  Typical\nerrors are:\n\n* The configuration file is non existent, or invalid yaml.\n* Running the action from a fork, as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has not enough\n  permissions to label the main repository ([issue for\n  solving this](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler/issues/3))\n\n## Configuring matching rules\n\nConfiguration can be stored at `.github/labeler.yml` as a plain list of\nlabel matchers, which consist of a label and a set of conditions for\neach.  When *all* conditions for a label match, then the Action will set\nthe given label.  When *any* condition for a label does not match, then\nthe Action will unset the given label.\n\nAll matchers follow this configuration pattern:\n\n```yaml\n<label>: ""MyLabel""\n<condition_name>: <condition_parameters>\n<condition_name>: <condition_parameters>\n```\n\nFor example, this `.github/labeler.yml` contains a single matcher with\na single condition:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n```\n\nA PR or issue with title ""WIP: this is work in progress"" would be\nlabelled as `WIP`.  If the title changes to ""This is done"", then the\n`WIP` label would be removed.\n\nEach label may combine multiple conditions.  The action combines all\nconditions with an AND operation.  That is, the label will be applied if\n*all* conditions are satisfied, removed otherwise.\n\nFor example, given this `.github/labeler.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n  mergeable: false\n```\n\nA pull request with title ""WIP: this is work in progress"" *and* not in a\nmergeable state would be labelled as `WIP`.  If the title changes to\n""This is done"", or it becomes mergeable, then the `WIP` label would be\nremoved.\n\nIf you wish to apply an OR, you may set multiple matchers for the same\nlabel. For example:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n- label: ""WIP""\n  mergeable: false\n```\n\nThe `WIP` label will be set if the title matches `^WIP:.*` OR the label\nis not in a mergeable state.\n\n### Negate rules\n\nAdding a `negate` property inside the label block will negate the\nresult of the evaluation of all conditions inside the label. For\nexample:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""unknown""\n  negate: True\n  branch: ""(master|hotfix)""\n```\n\nIn this case, label `unknown` will be set if the branch does NOT match\n`master` or `hotfix`.\n\nThe same behaviour occurs with multiple conditions:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""unknown""\n  negate: True\n  branch: ""master""\n  title: ""(feat).*""\n```\n\nOnly PRs that do NOT match one of the two conditions will get the\n`unknown` label.\n\n## Append-only mode\n\nThe default behaviour of this action includes *removing* labels that\nhave a rule configured that does not match anymore. For example, given\nthis configuration:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n```\n\nA PR or issue with title \'WIP: my feature\' will get the `WIP` label.\n\nNow the title changes to `My feature` the label will get remove. This is\nbecause the labeler configuration includes the `WIP` label, and its rule\ndoes not match anymore.\n\nIn some cases you would prefer that the action adds labels, but never\nremoves them regardless of the matching status. To achieve this you can\nenable the `appendOnly` flag.\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nappendOnly: true\nlabels:\n- label: ""WIP""\n  title: ""^WIP:.*""\n```\n\nWith this config, the behaviour changes:\n\n- A PR with title \'WIP: my feature\' will get the `WIP` label.\n- When the title changes to `My feature`, even though the labeler has a\n  rule for the `WIP` label that does not match, the label will be\n  respected.\n\n## Conditions\n\nBelow are the conditions currently supported in label matchers, in \nalphabetical order. Note that some conditions are only applicable to\npull requests.\n\nAll conditions evaluate only when they are explicitly added in\nconfiguration (that is, there are no default values).\n\n### Author can merge (PRs) <a name=""author-can-merge"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the author of the PR can merge it.\nThis is implemented by checking if the author is an owner of the repo.\n\n```yaml\nauthor-can-merge: True\n```\n### Authors (PRs and Issues)  <a name=""authors"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the author of the PR or Issue matches\nany of the given usernames.\n\n```yaml\nauthors: [""serubin""]\n```\n\n### Base branch (PRs only) <a name=""base-branch"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the PR base branch matches on the given\nregex.\n\n```yaml\nbase-branch: ""master""\n```\n\n### Body (PRs and Issues) <a name=""body"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the body (description) matches on the\ngiven regex.\n\n``` yaml\nbody: ""^patch.*""\n```\n\n### Branch (PRs only) <a name=""branch"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the PR branch matches on the given\nregex.\n\n```yaml\nbranch: ""^feature/.*""\n```\n\n### Draft status (PRs only) <a name=""draft"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the PR [draft\nstate](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#response-1) matches that of the\nPR.\n\n```yaml\ndraft: True\n```\n\nMatches if the PR is a draft.\n\n```yaml\ndraft: False\n```\n\nMatches if the PR is not a draft.\n\n### Files affected (PRs only) <a name=""files"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when any of the PR files matches on the\ngiven regexs.\n\n```yaml\nfiles: \n- ""cmd/.*_tests.go""\n```\n\n### Mergeable status (PRs only) <a name=""mergeable"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the [mergeable\nstate](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#response-1) matches that\nof the PR. \n\n```yaml\nmergeable: True\n```\n\nWill match if the label is mergeable. \n\n```yaml\nmergeable: False\n```\n\nWill match if the label is not mergeable. \n\n### Size (PRs only) <a name=""size"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the total number of changed lines in\nthe PR is within given thresholds.\n\nThe number of changed lines is calculated as the sum of all `additions +\ndeletions` in the PR.\n\nFor example, given this `.github/labeler.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n- label: ""S""\n  size:\n      below: 10\n- label: ""M""\n  size:\n      above: 9\n      below: 100\n- label: ""L""\n  size:\n      above: 100\n```\n\nThese would be the labels assigned to some PRs, based on their size as\nreported by the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls).\n\n|PR|additions|deletions|Resulting labels|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|First example|1|1|S|\n|Second example|5|42|M|\n|Third example|68|148|L|\n\nYou can exclude some files so that their changes are not taken into\naccount for the overall count. This can be useful for `yarn.lock`,\n`go.sum` and such. Use `exclude-files`:\n\n```yaml\n- label: ""L""\n    size:\n        exclude-files: [""yarn.lock""]\n        above: 100\n``` \n\nThis condition will apply the `L` label if the diff is above 100 lines,\nbut NOT taking into account changes in `yarn.lock`.\n\n**NOTICE** the old format for specifying size properties (`size-above`\nand `size-below`) has been deprecated. The action will continue\nsupporting old configs for now, but users are encouraged to migrate to\nthe new configuration schema.\n\n### Title <a name=""title"" />\n\nThis condition is satisfied when the title matches on the given regex.\n\n```yaml\ntitle: ""^WIP:.*""\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Built with <a href=""https://github.com/probot/probot"">Probot</a>.</p>\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:\n\n```yaml\nname: Release Drafter\n\non:\n  push:\n    # branches to consider in the event; optional, defaults to all\n    branches:\n      - master\n  # pull_request event is required only for autolabeler\n  pull_request:\n    # Only following types are handled by the action, but one can default to all as well\n    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n  # pull_request_target event is required for autolabeler to support PRs from forks\n  # pull_request_target:\n  #   types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n\njobs:\n  update_release_draft:\n    permissions:\n      # write permission is required to create a github release\n      contents: write\n      # write permission is required for autolabeler\n      # otherwise, read permission is required at least\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      # (Optional) GitHub Enterprise requires GHE_HOST variable set\n      #- name: Set GHE_HOST\n      #  run: |\n      #    echo ""GHE_HOST=${GITHUB_SERVER_URL##https:\\/\\/}"" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n\n      # Drafts your next Release notes as Pull Requests are merged into ""master""\n      - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5\n        # (Optional) specify config name to use, relative to .github/. Default: release-drafter.yml\n        # with:\n        #   config-name: my-config.yml\n        #   disable-autolabeler: true\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nIf you\'re unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.\n\n## Configuration\n\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository. The configuration file **must** reside in your default branch, no other configurations will be accepted.\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:\n\n```yml\ntemplate: |\n  ## What\xe2\x80\x99s Changed\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\nAs pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release"" width=""586"" />\n\nThe following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:\n\n```yml\nname-template: \'v$RESOLVED_VERSION \xf0\x9f\x8c\x88\'\ntag-template: \'v$RESOLVED_VERSION\'\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    labels:\n      - \'feature\'\n      - \'enhancement\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\xa7\xb0 Maintenance\'\n    label: \'chore\'\nchange-template: \'- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)\'\nchange-title-escapes: \'\\<*_&\' # You can add # and @ to disable mentions, and add ` to disable code blocks.\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - \'major\'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - \'minor\'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - \'patch\'\n  default: patch\ntemplate: |\n  ## Changes\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nYou can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n| Key                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `template`                 | Required | The template for the body of the draft release.

Refer to [Version Resolver](#version-resolver) to learn more about this.                      |\n\n## Version Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:\n\n| Variable    | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `$PATCH`    | The patch version number.                                    |\n| `$MINOR`    | The minor version number.                                    |\n| `$MAJOR`    | The major version number.                                    |\n| `$COMPLETE` | The complete version string (including any prerelease info). |\n\n## Version Resolver\n\nWith the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - \'major\'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - \'minor\'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - \'patch\'\n  default: patch\n```\n\nThe above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.\n\nIf a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.\n\n## Change Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:\n\n| Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NUMBER`        | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `$TITLE`         | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. Any characters excluding @ and # matching `change-title-escapes` will be prepended with a backslash so that they will appear verbatim instead of being interpreted as markdown format characters. @s and #s if present in `change-title-escapes` will be appended with an HTML comment so that they don\'t become mentions. |\n| `$AUTHOR`        | The pull request author\xe2\x80\x99s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| `$BODY`          | The body of the pull request e.g. `Fixed spelling mistake`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$URL`           | The URL of the pull request e.g. `https://github.com/octocat/repo/pull/42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$BASE_REF_NAME` | The base name of of the base Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `master`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `$HEAD_REF_NAME` | The head name of the head Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `my-bug-fix`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## References\n\n**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)\n\nReferences takes an list and accepts strings and regex.\nIf none are specified, we default to the repository\xe2\x80\x99s default branch usually master.\n\n```yaml\nreferences:\n  - master\n  - v.+\n```\n\nCurrently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene\n\n## Categorize Pull Requests\n\nWith the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 Features\'\n    label: \'feature\'\n  - title: \'\xf0\x9f\x90\x9b Bug Fixes\'\n    labels:\n      - \'fix\'\n      - \'bugfix\'\n      - \'bug\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""feature"" or ""fix"" will now be grouped together:\n\n<img src=""design/screenshot-2.png"" alt=""Screenshot of generated draft release with categories"" width=""586"" />\n\nAdding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using the embedded Autolabeler functionality (see below),\n[PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).\n\nOptionally you can add a `collapse-after` entry to your category item, if the category has more than the defined `collapse-after` pull requests then it will show all pull requests collapsed for that category. Append the `collapse-after` integer to your category as following:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: \'\xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f Dependencies\'\n    collapse-after: 3\n    labels:\n      - \'dependencies\'\n```\n\n## Exclude Pull Requests\n\nWith the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nexclude-labels:\n  - \'skip-changelog\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""skip-changelog"" will now be excluded from the release draft.\n\n## Include Pull Requests\n\nWith the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ninclude-labels:\n  - \'app-foo\'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label ""app-foo"" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.\n\n## Exclude Contributors\n\nBy default, the `$CONTRIBUTORS` variable will contain the names or usernames of all the contributors of a release. The `exclude-contributors` option allows you to remove certain usernames from that list. This can be useful if don\'t wish to include yourself, to better highlight only the third-party contributions.\n\n```yml\nexclude-contributors:\n  - \'myusername\'\n```\n\n## Replacers\n\nYou can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.\n\n```yml\nreplacers:\n  - search: \'/CVE-(\\d{4})-(\\d+)/g\'\n    replace: \'https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-$1-$2\'\n  - search: \'myname\'\n    replace: \'My Name\'\n```\n\n## Autolabeler\n\nYou can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).\nMatchers are evaluated independently; the label will be set if at least one of the matchers meets the criteria.\n\n```yml\nautolabeler:\n  - label: \'chore\'\n    files:\n      - \'*.md\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/docs{0,1}\\/.+/\'\n  - label: \'bug\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/fix\\/.+/\'\n    title:\n      - \'/fix/i\'\n  - label: \'enhancement\'\n    branch:\n      - \'/feature\\/.+/\'\n    body:\n      - \'/JIRA-[0-9]{1,4}/\'\n```\n\n## Projects that don\'t use Semantic Versioning\n\nIf your project doesn\'t follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.\n\nFor example, if your project doesn\'t use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.\n\n## Action Inputs\n\nThe Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.\n\n| Input         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `config-name` | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that\'s where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `name`        | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `name-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `tag`         | The tag name to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any `tag-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `version`     | The version to be associated with the GitHub release that\'s created or updated. This will override any version calculated by the release-drafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `publish`     | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |\n| `prerelease`  | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated is a prerelease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `latest`      | A string indicating whether the release being created or updated should be marked as latest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `commitish`   | A string specifying the target branch for the release being created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| `header`      | A string that would be added before the template body.

Outputs\n\nThe Release Drafter GitHub Action sets a couple of outputs which can be used as inputs to other Actions in the workflow ([example](https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset)).\n\n| Output       | Description

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`         | The ID of the release that was created or updated.

commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nyarn install\n\n# Run the tests\nyarn test\n\n# Run the app locally\nyarn test:watch\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you\'ll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.\n\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):\n\n```sh\n# Run the tests\ndocker compose run --rm app\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThird-party contributions are welcome! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nIf you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.\n\n## Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).\n\n## Releasing\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]\n```\n\nThe command does the following:\n\n- Ensures you\xe2\x80\x99re on master and don\xe2\x80\x99t have local, un-commited changes\n- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch\n- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:\n  - Runs test\n  - Pushes the tag to GitHub, which triggers GitHub Action that does the following:\n    - Push GitHub app to Heroku\n    - Releases NPM\n    - Publish the Release Draft!\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

uses: dessant/lock-threads@v4\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## How are issues and pull requests determined to be inactive?\n\nThe action uses GitHub\'s [updated](https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated)\nsearch qualifier to determine inactivity. Any change to an issue or pull request\nis considered an update, including comments, changing labels,\napplying or removing milestones, or pushing commits.\n\nAn easy way to check and see which issues or pull requests will initially\nbe locked is to add the `updated` search qualifier to either the issue\nor pull request search field for your repository:\n`is:closed is:unlocked updated:<2018-12-20`.\nAdjust the date to be 365 days ago (or whatever you set for `*-inactive-days`)\nto see which issues or pull requests will be locked.\n\n## Why are only some issues and pull requests processed?\n\nTo avoid triggering abuse prevention mechanisms on GitHub, only 50 issues\nand pull requests will be handled at once.

Does nothing on Linux and macOS.\n\n## Example usage\n\nBasic usage for default compilation settings is like this:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test:\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1\n      - name: Build something requiring CL.EXE\n        run: |\n          cmake -G ""NMake Makefiles"" .\n          nmake\n      # ...\n```\n\nIf you want something non-default,\nlike using a specific version of Visual Studio,\nor cross-compling for a differen target,\nyou will need to configure those settings via inputs:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  test:\n    # Run a job for each of the specified target architectures:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        arch:\n          - amd64\n          - amd64_x86\n          - amd64_arm64\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1\n        with:\n          arch: ${{ matrix.arch }}\n      - name: Build something requiring CL.EXE\n        run: |\n          cmake -G ""NMake Makefiles"" .\n          nmake\n      # ...\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `arch` \xe2\x80\x93 target architecture\n  - native compilation:\n    - `x64` (default) or its synonyms: `amd64`, `win64`, `x86_64`, `x86-64`\n    - `x86` or its synonyms: `win32`\n  - cross-compilation: `x86_amd64`, `x86_arm`, `x86_arm64`, `amd64_x86`, `amd64_arm`, `amd64_arm64`\n- `sdk` \xe2\x80\x93 Windows SDK to use\n  - do not specify to use the default SDK\n  - or specify full Windows 10 SDK number (e.g, `10.0.10240.0`)\n  - or write `8.1` to use Windows 8.1 SDK\n- `toolset` \xe2\x80\x93 select VC++ compiler toolset version\n  - do not specify to use the default toolset\n  - `14.0` for VC++ 2015 Compiler Toolset\n  - `14.XX` for the latest 14.XX toolset installed (e.g, `14.11`)\n  - `14.XX.YYYYY` for a specific full version number (e.g, `14.11.25503`)\n- `uwp` \xe2\x80\x93 set `true` to build for Universal Windows Platform (i.e., for Windows Store)\n- `spectre` \xe2\x80\x93 set `true` to use Visual Studio libraries with [Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com) mitigations\n\n- `vsversion` - The Visual Studio version to use. This can be the version number (e.g. 16.0 for 2019) or the year (e.g. ""2019"").\n\n## Caveats\n\n### Name conflicts with `shell: bash`\n\nUsing `shell: bash` in Actions may shadow some of the paths added by MSVC.\nIn particular, `link.exe` (Microsoft C linker) is prone to be shadowed by `/usr/bin/link` (GNU filesystem link tool).\n\nUnfortunately, this happens because GitHub Actions unconditionally *prepend* GNU paths when `shell: bash` is used,\non top of any paths set by `msvc-dev-cmd`, every time at the start of each new step.\nHence, there aren\'t many non-destructive options here.\n\nIf you experience compilation errors where `link` complains about unreasonable command-line arguments,\n\xe2\x80\x9cextra operand *something-something*\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that\'s probably it.\nRecommended workaround is to remove `/usr/bin/link` if that interferes with your builds.\nIf this is not acceptable, please file an issue, then we\'ll figure out something better.\n\n### Reconfiguration\n\nYou can invoke `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` multiple times during your jobs with different inputs\nto reconfigure the environment for building with different settings\n(e.g., to target multiple architectures).\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  release:\n    steps:\n      # ...\n      - name: Configure build for amd64\n        uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1\n        with:\n          arch: amd64\n\n      - run: build # (for amd64)\n\n      - name: Configure build for x86\n        uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1\n        with:\n          arch: amd64_x86\n\n      - run: build # (for x86)\n\n      - name: Configure build for ARM64\n        uses: ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1\n        with:\n          arch: amd64_arm64\n\n      - run: build # (for ARM64)\n\n      # ...\n```\n\nThis mostly works but it\'s not really recommended\nsince Developer Command Prompt was not meant for recursive reconfiguration.\nThat said, if it does not work for you, please file an issue.\n\nConsider using [`strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)\nto execute different build configuration in parallel, independent environments.\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
69,"b'# Octokit Request Action\n\n> A GitHub Action to send arbitrary requests to GitHub\'s REST API\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/octokit/request-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octokit/request-action/actions)\n\n## Usage\n\nMinimal example\n\n```yml\nname: Log latest release\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  logLatestRelease:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: octokit/request-action@v2.x\n        id: get_latest_release\n        with:\n          route: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest\n          owner: octokit\n          repo: request-action\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - run: ""echo latest release: \'${{ steps.get_latest_release.outputs.data }}\'""\n```\n\nMore complex examples involving `POST`, setting custom media types, and parsing output data\n\n```yml\nname: Check run\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  create-file:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      # Create check run\n      - uses: octokit/request-action@v2.x\n        id: create_check_run\n        with:\n          route: POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs\n          owner: octokit\n          repo: request-action\n          name: ""Test check run""\n          head_sha: ${{ github.sha }}\n          output: | # The | is significant!\n            title: Test check run title\n            summary: A summary of the test check run\n            images:\n              - alt: Test image\n                image_url: https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      # Download file\n      - uses: octokit/request-action@v2.x\n        id: download_file\n        with:\n          route: GET /repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/README.md\n          owner: octokit\n          repo: request-action\n          mediaType: | # The | is significant!\n            format: raw\n         env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      # Update check run to completed, successful status\n      - uses: octokit/request-action@v2.x\n        id: update_check_run\n        with:\n          route: PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs/{check_run_id}\n          owner: octokit\n          repo: request-action\n          check_run_id: ${{ fromJson(steps.create_check_run.outputs.data).id }}\n          conclusion: ""success""\n          status: ""completed""\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nHandle errors\n\n```yml\nname: Log latest release\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  handleError:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: octokit/request-action@v2.x\n        id: get_release\n        with:\n          route: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/v0.9.9\n          owner: octokit\n          repo: request-action\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - run: ""echo Release found: \'${{ steps.get_release.outputs.data }}\'""\n      - run: ""echo Release could not be found. Request failed with status \'${{ steps.get_release.outputs.status }}\'""\n        if: ${{ failure() }}\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\nTo use request body parameters, simply pass in an `input` matching the parameter name. See previous examples.\n\nDue to how request parameters are processed, it may be necessary in some cases to first encode the value as either JSON or a block scalar:\n\n```yml\nenv:\n  REQUEST_BODY: |\n    Multi-line string with *special* characters:\n    - ""\'`\nwith:\n  # As JSON\n  body: ${{ toJSON(env.REQUEST_BODY) }}\n\n  # As block scalar\n  body: |\n    |\n    ${{ env.REQUEST_BODY }}\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo see additional debug logs, create a secret with the name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and value `true`.\n\n## How it works\n\n`octokit/request-action` is using [`@octokit/request`](https://github.com/octokit/request.js/) internally with the addition\nthat requests are automatically authenticated using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. It is required to prevent rate limiting, as all anonymous requests from the same origin count against the same low rate.\n\nThe actions sets `data` output to the response data. The action also sets the `headers` (again, to a JSON string) and `status` output properties.\n\nTo access deep values of `outputs.data` and `outputs.headers`, check out the [fromJson](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#fromjson) function.\n\n## Warnings\n\nThe GitHub Actions runners are currently showing warnings when using this action that look like:\n\n```\n##[warning]Unexpected input \'repository\', valid inputs are [\'route\', \'mediaType\']\n```\n\nThe reason for this warning is because the `repository` key is not listed as a possible value in `actions.yml`. This warning will appear for any key used under the `with` except `route` and `mediaType`. Due to the flexible nature of the required inputs depending on the `route`, not all of the possible parameters can be listed in `actions.yml`, so you will see this warning under normal usage of the action. As long as you see a 200 response code at the bottom of the output, everything should have worked properly and you can ignore the warnings. The response code will appear at the bottom of the output from the action and looks like:\n\n```\n< 200 451ms\n```\n\nSee [Issue #26](https://github.com/octokit/request-action/issues/26) for more information.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Pre-release versions are opt-in, so `1.11.x` will\nnot match a pre-release.\n\n### Basic example\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1\n        with:\n          otp-version: \'22.2\'\n          elixir-version: \'1.9.4\'\n      - run: mix deps.get\n      - run: mix test\n```\n\n### Matrix example\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    name: OTP ${{matrix.otp}} / Elixir ${{matrix.elixir}}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        otp: [\'20.3\', \'21.3\', \'22.2\']\n        elixir: [\'1.8.2\', \'1.9.4\']\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1\n        with:\n          otp-version: ${{matrix.otp}}\n          elixir-version: ${{matrix.elixir}}\n      - run: mix deps.get\n      - run: mix test\n```\n\n### Phoenix example\n\n```yaml\non: push\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    services:\n      db:\n        image: postgres:11\n        ports: [\'5432:5432\']\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n        options: >-\n          --health-cmd pg_isready\n          --health-interval 10s\n          --health-timeout 5s\n          --health-retries 5\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-elixir@v1\n        with:\n          otp-version: \'22.2\'\n          elixir-version: \'1.9.4\'\n      - run: mix deps.get\n      - run: mix test\n```\n\n#### Authenticating with Postgres in Phoenix\n\nWhen using the Phoenix example above, the `postgres` container has some\ndefault authentication set up. Specifically, it expects a username of\n""postgres"", and a password of ""postgres"". It will be available at\n`localhost:5432`.\n\nThe simplest way of setting these auth values in CI is by checking for the\n`GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable that is set in all workflows:\n\n```elixir\n# config/test.exs\n\nuse Mix.Config\n\n# Configure the database for local testing\nconfig :app, App.Repo,\n  database: ""my_app_test"",\n  hostname: ""localhost"",\n  pool: Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox\n\n# Configure the database for GitHub Actions\nif System.get_env(""GITHUB_ACTIONS"") do\n  config :app, App.Repo,\n    username: ""postgres"",\n    password: ""postgres""\nend\n```\n\n## Matchers\n\nThe problem matchers in this repository are adapted from [here](https://github.com/fr1zle/vscode-elixir/blob/45eddb589acd7ac98e0c7305d1c2b24668ca709a/package.json#L70-L118).

73,"b'# setup-ruby\n\nThis action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.\n\nIt is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.\nNo extra packages need to be installed.\n\n**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.\nIf you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit\nwill be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).\n\n### Supported Versions\n\nThis action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:\n\n| Interpreter | Versions |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| `ruby` | 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.9, 2.2, all versions from 2.3.0 until 3.3.0-preview1, head, debug, mingw, mswin, ucrt |\n| `jruby` | 9.1.17.0 - 9.4.3.0, head |\n| `truffleruby` | 19.3.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n| `truffleruby+graalvm` | 21.2.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n\n`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  \n\nRegarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64\nbuilds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.\n\nPreview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).\nHowever, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,\nas it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.\n\nOnly release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)\nare available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10\non other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.\n\nNote that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,\nwhich means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.\n\n| Operating System | Supported |\n| ---------------- | --------- |\n| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |\n| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |\n| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |\n\nThe prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)\nand on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).\nThe `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).\n`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),\n`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),\n`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)\nand `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).\nThe full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)\nfor Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Single Job\n\n```yaml\nname: My workflow\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    -

run: bundle exec rake\n```\n\nSee the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the\n[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)\nand the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).\n\n### Supported Version Syntax\n\n* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`\n* short version like `\'2.6\'`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.10`)\n* version only like `\'2.6.5\'`, assumes MRI for the engine\n* engine only like `ruby` and `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation\n* `.ruby-version` reads from the project\'s `.ruby-version` file\n* `.tool-versions` reads from the project\'s `.tool-versions` file\n* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`\n\n### Working Directory\n\nThe `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`\nif they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.\n\n### RubyGems\n\nBy default, the default RubyGems version that comes with each Ruby is used.\nHowever, users can optionally customize the RubyGems version that they want by\nsetting the `rubygems` input.\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `rubygems` input.\n\nIf you\'re running into `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 4,\nexpected 1)` errors with a stacktrace including Psych and RubyGems entries, you\nshould be able to fix them by setting `rubygems: 3.0.0` or higher.\n\n### Bundler\n\nBy default, Bundler is installed as follows:\n\n* If there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,\n  that version of Bundler will be installed and used.\n* If the Ruby ships with Bundler 2.2+ (as a default gem), that version is used.\n* Otherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.3, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.3).\n\nThis behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for more details about the `bundler` input.\n\n### Caching `bundle install` automatically\n\nThis action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:\n```yaml\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n```\n\nNote that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.\n\nThis caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  \nIt needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  \nIf there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.\n\nTo use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level\nas shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\n\n#### bundle config\n\nWhen using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.\nThese can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.\nThey should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\nTo find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.\nYou might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.\n\nTo perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  \nTherefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).\n\n#### How it Works\n\nWhen there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.\nIn other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.\nThe hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.\n\n#### Dealing with a corrupted cache\n\nIn some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system\nat the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.\nIn order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value\nif you have already used it before.)\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n        cache-version: 1\n```\n\n#### Caching `bundle install` manually\n\nIt is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.\nThere are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).\nSo, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.\n\n## Windows\n\nNote that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.\nIt is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.\n\n* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.\n* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).\n* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.\n* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.\n* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.\n* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).\n* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).\n\n## Versioning\n\nIt is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.\nThis will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.\n\nIf you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and\nit will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.\nMake sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.\n\nThis action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.\nThis follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.\n\n## Using self-hosted runners\n\nThis action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)\nif the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:\n\n* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.\n* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.\n* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed\n* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,\n  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.\n  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.\n* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.\n\nIn other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case\n(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).\nYou could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.\n\n## History\n\nThis action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.\nPlease [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe current maintainer of this action is @eregon.\nMost of the Windows logic is based on work by MSP-Greg.\nMany thanks to MSP-Greg and Lars Kanis for the help with Ruby Installer.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
74,"b'# GitHub Action - Publish Gem to Rubygems\n\nThis is a GitHub Action written to streamline the Ruby gem publication process.  The action sets the Gem Credentials from `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY`secrets, and then runs `rake release` in your project root.  You can override this command by setting `RELEASE_COMMAND` environment variable to the script that creates and publishes (this is usually only the case when a repository hosts multiple gems together).\n\n# Secrets Needed\n\n`GITHUB_TOKEN` - Bundler needs this to create tags on your repo for the release\n`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` - The Rubygems API Key for an Owner of the Gem you wish to publish.

76,"b'# rsync deployments\n\nThis GitHub Action (amd64) deploys files in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to a remote folder via rsync over ssh. \n\nUse this action in a CD workflow which leaves deployable code in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.\n\nThe base-image [drinternet/rsync](https://github.com/JoshPiper/rsync-docker/) of this action is very small and is based on Alpine 3.17.2 (no cache) which results in fast deployments.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `switches`* - The first is for any initial/required rsync flags, eg: `-avzr --delete`\n\n- `rsh` - Remote shell commands\n\n- `path` - The source path. Defaults to GITHUB_WORKSPACE and is relative to it\n\n- `remote_path`* - The deployment target path\n\n- `remote_host`* - The remote host\n\n- `remote_port` - The remote port. Defaults to 22\n\n- `remote_user`* - The remote user\n\n- `remote_key`* - The remote ssh key\n\n- `remote_key_pass` - The remote ssh key passphrase (if any)\n\n``* = Required``\n\n## Required secret(s)\n\nThis action needs secret variables for the ssh private key of your key pair. The public key part should be added to the authorized_keys file on the server that receives the deployment. The secret variable should be set in the Github secrets section of your org/repo and then referenced as the  `remote_key` input.\n\n> Always use secrets when dealing with sensitive inputs!\n\nFor simplicity, we are using `DEPLOY_*` as the secret variables throughout the examples.\n\n## Example usage\n\nSimple:\n\n```\nname: DEPLOY\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    -

Using this\naction will add `nuget` to your `$PATH` on all operating systems, including\nmacOS and linux, without having to prefix it with `mono`.\n\nNuGet functionality also gets delivered with Visual Studio, msbuild and dotnet SDK. You should consider using the\nofficial [`setup-dotnet`](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) or\n[one of the `msbuild` actions](https://github.com/marketplace?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=msbuild).\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\nSupported values for `nuget-version`:\n\n* `latest` -- the latest blessed NuGet release.\n* `preview` -- the latest EarlyAccessPreview release.\n* `X.Y.Z` -- concrete semver version for a release (e.g. `5.3.1`).\n* semver range -- any [valid semver range specifier](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges) (e.g. `5`, `>=5`, `5.3.x`, etc)\n\nThis action also supports configuring your NuGet API key using\n[GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).\nThe API key should be passed in as an `nuget-api-key` input. See\n[the GitHub documentation on secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets)\nfor how to configure secrets on your repository.\n\n### Basic:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@master\n- uses: nuget/setup-nuget@v1\n  with:\n    nuget-api-key: ${{ secrets.NuGetAPIKey }}\n    nuget-version: \'5.x\'\n- run: nuget restore MyProject.sln\n```\n\n### Matrix Testing:\n\n```yaml\nname: NuGet Restore\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest]\n        nuget: [latest, preview, 4.x, 5.3.1]\n    name: NuGet@${{ matrix.nuget }} sample\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Setup NuGet.exe\n        uses: nuget/setup-nuget@v1\n        with:\n          nuget-version: ${{ matrix.nuget }}\n      - run: nuget restore MyProject.sln\n```\n\n# Caching\n\nThe downloaded `nuget.exe` files are automatically cached between runs. To cache\nyour global nuget directory, consider using the [official cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#c---nuget).\n\n### Caching Example\n\nNote: For this example, you\'ll need to enable [repeatable builds](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/) for your project.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@master\n- uses: nuget/setup-nuget@v1\n  with:\n    nuget-version: \'5.x\'\n- uses: actions/cache@v1\n  id: cache\n  with:\n    path: ~/.nuget/packages\n    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-${{ hashFiles(\'**/packages.lock.json\') }}\n- name: NuGet Restore\n  if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n  run: nuget restore MyProject.sln\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Code in Main\n\nInstall the dependencies\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nBuild the typescript and package it for distribution\n```bash\n$ npm run build && npm run package\n```\n\nRun the tests :heavy_check_mark:\n```bash\n$ npm test\n\n PASS  ./index.test.js\n  \xe2\x9c\x93 throws invalid number (3ms)\n  \xe2\x9c\x93 wait 500 ms (504ms)\n  \xe2\x9c\x93 test runs (95ms)\n\n...\n```\n\n## Publish to a distribution branch\n\nActions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.\n\nThen run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:\n```bash\n$ npm run package\n$ git add dist\n$ git commit -a -m ""prod dependencies""\n$ git push origin releases/v1\n```\n\nNote: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.\n\nYour action is now published! :rocket:\n\nSee the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)\n\n\n# License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

84,"b'# Pull Request Labeler\n\n[![Basic validation](https://github.com/actions/labeler/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/actions/labeler/actions/workflows/basic-validation.yml)\n\nAutomatically label new pull requests based on the paths of files being changed.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create `.github/labeler.yml`\n\nCreate a `.github/labeler.yml` file with a list of labels and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) globs to match to apply the label.\n\nThe key is the name of the label in your repository that you want to add (e.g. `merge conflict`, `needs-updating`) and the value is the path (glob) of the changed files (e.g. `src/**`, `tests/*.spec.js`) or a match object.\n\n#### Match Object\n\nFor more control over matching, you can provide a match object instead of a simple path glob. The match object is defined as:\n\n```yml\n- any: [\'list\', \'of\', \'globs\']\n  all: [\'list\', \'of\', \'globs\']\n```\n\nOne or both fields can be provided for fine-grained matching. Unlike the top-level list, the list of path globs provided to `any` and `all` must ALL match against a path for the label to be applied.\n\nThe fields are defined as follows:\n* `any`: match ALL globs against ANY changed path\n* `all`: match ALL globs against ALL changed paths\n\nA simple path glob is the equivalent to `any: [\'glob\']`. More specifically, the following two configurations are equivalent:\n```yml\nlabel1:\n- example1/*\n```\nand\n```yml\nlabel1:\n- any: [\'example1/*\']\n```\n\nFrom a boolean logic perspective, top-level match objects are `OR`-ed together and individual match rules within an object are `AND`-ed. Combined with `!` negation, you can write complex matching rules.\n\n> \xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f This action uses [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) to apply glob patterns.\n> For historical reasons, paths starting with dot (e.g. `.github`) are not matched by default.\n> You need to set `dot: true` to change this behavior.\n> See [Inputs](#inputs) table below for details.\n\n#### Basic Examples\n\n```yml\n# Add \'label1\' to any changes within \'example\' folder or any subfolders\nlabel1:\n- example/**\n\n# Add \'label2\' to any file changes within \'example2\' folder\nlabel2: example2/*\n\n# Add label3 to any change to .txt files within the entire repository. Quotation marks are required for the leading asterisk\nlabel3:\n- \'**/*.txt\'\n\n```\n\n#### Common Examples\n\n```yml\n# Add \'repo\' label to any root file changes\nrepo:\n- \'*\'\n\n# Add \'@domain/core\' label to any change within the \'core\' package\n\'@domain/core\':\n- package/core/**\n\n# Add \'test\' label to any change to *.spec.js files within the source dir\ntest:\n- src/**/*.spec.js\n\n# Add \'source\' label to any change to src files within the source dir EXCEPT for the docs sub-folder\nsource:\n- any: [\'src/**\', \'!src/docs/*\']\n\n# Add \'frontend` label to any change to *.js files as long as the `main.js` hasn\'t changed\nfrontend:\n- any: [\'src/**/*.js\']\n  all: [\'!src/main.js\']\n\n# Add the \'AnyChange\' label to any changes within the entire repository if the \'dot\' option is set to \'false\'\nAnyChange:\n- \'**\'\n- \'**/.*\'\n- \'**/.*/**\'\n- \'**/.*/**/.*\'\n\n# Add the \'AnyChange\' label to any changes within the entire repository if the \'dot\' option is set to \'true\'\nAnyChange:\n- \'**\'\n```\n\n### Create Workflow\n\nCreate a workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the labeler action with content:\n\n```yml\nname: ""Pull Request Labeler""\non:\n- pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  triage:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/labeler@v4\n```\n\n#### Inputs\n\nVarious inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml) to let you configure the labeler:\n\n| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Default               |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| `repo-token`         | Token to use to authorize label changes.

If the file doesn\'t exist at the specified path on the runner, action will read from the source repository via the Github API. | `.github/labeler.yml` |\n| `sync-labels`        | Whether or not to remove labels when matching files are reverted or no longer changed by the PR                                                                          | `false`               |\n| `dot`                | Whether or not to auto-include paths starting with dot (e.g. `.github`)                                                                                                  | `false`               |\n| `pr-number`          | The number(s) of pull request to update, rather than detecting from the workflow context                                                                                 | N/A                   |\n\n##### Using `configuration-path` input together with the `@actions/checkout` action\nYou might want to use action called [@actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to upload label configuration file onto the runner from the current or any other repositories. See usage example below:\n\n```yml\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Uploads repository content to the runner\n      with:\n        repository: ""owner/repositoryName"" # The one of the available inputs, visit https://github.com/actions/checkout#readme to find more\n    - uses: actions/labeler@v4\n```\n\n##### Peculiarities of using the `dot` input\n\nWhen `dot` is disabled, and you want to include _all_ files in a folder:\n\n```yml\nlabel1:\n- path/to/folder/**/*\n- path/to/folder/**/.*\n```\n\nIf `dot` is enabled:\n\n```yml\nlabel1:\n- path/to/folder/**\n```\n\n##### Example workflow specifying Pull request numbers\n\n```yml\nname: ""Label Previous Pull Requests""\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""0 1 * * 1""\n\njobs:\n  triage:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    \n    # Label PRs 1, 2, and 3\n    - uses: actions/labeler@v4\n      with:        \n        pr-number: |\n          1\n          2\n          3\n```\n\n**Note:** in normal usage the `pr-number` input is not required as the action will detect the PR number from the workflow context.\n\n\n#### Outputs \n\nLabeler provides the following outputs:  \n\n| Name         | Description                                               |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `new-labels` | A comma-separated list of all new labels                  |\n| `all-labels` | A comma-separated list of all labels that the PR contains |\n\nThe following example performs steps based on the output of labeler:\n```yml\nname: ""My workflow""\non:\n- pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  triage:\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - id: label-the-PR\n      uses: actions/labeler@v4\n      \n    - id: run-frontend-tests\n      if: contains(steps.label-the-PR.outputs.all-labels, \'frontend\')\n      run: |\n        echo ""Running frontend tests...""\n        # Put your commands for running frontend tests here\n  \n    - id: run-backend-tests\n      if: contains(steps.label-the-PR.outputs.all-labels, \'backend\')\n      run: |\n        echo ""Running backend tests...""\n        # Put your commands for running backend tests here\n```\n\n## Permissions\n\nIn order to add labels to pull requests, the GitHub labeler action requires\nwrite permissions on the pull-request. However, when the action runs on a pull\nrequest from a forked repository, GitHub only grants read access tokens for\n`pull_request` events, at most. If you encounter an `Error: HttpError: Resource\nnot accessible by integration`, it\'s likely due to these permission constraints.\nTo resolve this issue, you can modify the `on:` section of your workflow to use\n[`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)\ninstead of `pull_request` (see example [above](#create-workflow)). This change\nallows the action to have write access, because `pull_request_target` alters the\n[context of the\naction](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)\nand safely grants additional permissions. Refer to the [GitHub token\npermissions\ndocumentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)\nfor more details about access levels and event contexts.\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are welcome!

A requirement object has the following keys:\n\n* `name` is an optional informative name for the requirement.\n* `paths` is an array of path patterns, or the string ""unmatched"". If an array, the reviewers\n  specified will be checked if any path in the array matches any path in the PR. If the string\n  ""unmatched"", the reviewers are checked if any file in the PR has not been matched yet.\n* `consume` is a boolean, defaulting to false. If set, any paths that match this rule will be ignored\n  for all following rules.\n\n  This is intended for things like lockfiles or changelogs that you might want to allow everyone\n  to edit in any package in a monorepo, to avoid having to manually exclude these files in every\n  requirement for each different team owning some package.\n* `teams` is an array of strings that are GitHub team slugs in the organization or repository. A\n  review is required from a member of any of these teams.\n\n  Instead of a string, a single-keyed object may be specified. The key is either `all-of` or\n  `any-of`, and the value is an array as for `teams`. When the key is `all-of`, a review is required\n  from every team (but if a person is a member of multiple teams, they can satisfy multiple\n  requirements). When it\'s `any-of`, one review from any team is needed.\n\n  Additionally, you can specify a single user by prefixing their username with `@`. For example,\n  `@example` will be treated as a virtual team with one member; `example`.\n\nPaths are matched using the [picomatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picomatch#globbing-features) library.\n\nEvery requirement object that applies must have appropriate reviews, it\'s not ""first match"". Thus,\nusing the example below, a PR touching file at docs/foo.css would need reviews satisfying both\nthe ""Docs"" and ""Front end"" review requirements. If you wanted to avoid that, you might add\n`!**.css` to the first\'s paths or `!docs/**` to the second\'s.\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\n# Documentation must be reviewed by the documentation team.\n- name: Docs\n  paths:\n   - \'docs/**\'\n  teams:\n   - documentation\n\n# Everyone can update lockfiles, even if later rules might otherwise match.\n- name: Lockfiles\n  paths:\n   - \'packages/*/composer.lock\'\n   - \'**.css\'\n  consume: true\n  teams:\n   - everyone\n\n# The ""Some package"" team must approve anything in `packages/some-package/`.\n# Except for changes to `packages/some-package/composer.lock`, because the previous requirement consumed that path.\n- name: Some package\n  paths:\n   - \'packages/some-package/**\'\n  teams:\n   - some-package-team\n\n# Any CSS and React .jsx files must be reviewed by a front-end developer AND by a designer,\n# OR by a member of the maintenance team.\n- name: Front end\n  paths:\n   - \'**.jsx\'\n   - \'**.css\'\n  teams:\n   - all-of:\n      - front-end\n      - design\n   - maintenance\n\n# All other files must be reviewed by the maintenance team.\n- name: Misc\n  paths: unmatched\n  teams:\n    - maintenance\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
86,"b'# Setup MSYS2\n\n<p align=""center"">\n  <a title=""Dependency Status"" href=""https://david-dm.org/numworks/setup-msys2""><img src=""https://img.shields.io/david/numworks/setup-msys2.svg?longCache=true&logo=npm&label=deps""></a><!--\n  -->\n  <a title=""\'action\' workflow Status"" href=""https://github.com/numworks/setup-msys2/actions""><img alt=""\'action\' workflow Status"" src=""https://github.com/numworks/setup-msys2/workflows/action/badge.svg""></a>\n</p>\n\n**setup-msys2** is a JavaScript GitHub Action (GHA) to setup a full-featured [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) environment, using the GHA [toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).\n\nThe latest tarball available at [repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64](http://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/) is cached. Using the action extracts it and provides an entrypoint named `msys2do`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n  - run: msys2do uname -a\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### msystem\n\nBy default, `MSYSTEM` is set to `MINGW64`. However, an optional parameter named `msystem` is supported, which expects `MSYS`, `MINGW64` or `MING32`. For example:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n    with:\n      msystem: MSYS\n```\n\nFurthermore, the environment variable can be overriden. This is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts. For example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n    with:\n      msystem: MSYS\n  - run: msys2do makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar\n  - run: msys2do pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz\n  - run: |\n      set MSYSTEM=MINGW64\n      msys2do <command to test the package>\n```\n\n#### path-type\n\nBy default, `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE` is set to `strict` by `msys2do`. It is possible to override it either using an option or setting the environment variable explicitly:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n    with:\n      path-type: inherit\n  - run: msys2do <command>\n```\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n  - run: msys2do <command>\n    env:\n      MSYS2_PATH_TYPE: inherit\n```\n\n#### update\n\nBy default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball. By setting option `update` to `true`, the action will execute `pacman -Syu --no-confirm`:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: numworks/setup-msys2@v1\n    with:\n      update: true\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

89,"b'# setup-ruby\n\nThis action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.\n\nIt is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.\nNo extra packages need to be installed.\n\n**Important:** Prefer `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`.\nIf you pin to a commit or release, only the Ruby versions available at the time of the commit\nwill be available, and you will need to update it to use newer Ruby versions, see [Versioning](#versioning).\n\n### Supported Versions\n\nThis action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:\n\n| Interpreter | Versions |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| `ruby` | 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.9, 2.2, all versions from 2.3.0 until 3.3.0-preview1, head, debug, mingw, mswin, ucrt |\n| `jruby` | 9.1.17.0 - 9.4.3.0, head |\n| `truffleruby` | 19.3.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n| `truffleruby+graalvm` | 21.2.0 - 23.0.0, head |\n\n`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  \n\nRegarding Windows ruby master builds, `mingw` is a MSYS2/MinGW build, `head` & `ucrt` are MSYS2/UCRT64\nbuilds, and `mswin` is a MSVC/VS 2022 build.\n\nPreview and RC versions of Ruby might be available too on Ubuntu and macOS (not on Windows).\nHowever, it is recommended to test against `ruby-head` rather than previews,\nas it provides more useful feedback for the Ruby core team and for upcoming changes.\n\nOnly release versions published by [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives/)\nare available on Windows.  Due to that, Ruby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows and 2.2.10\non other platforms. Ruby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3.\n\nNote that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,\nwhich means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.4 is unmaintained and considered insecure.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe action works on these [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) images. Runner images not listed below are not supported yet. `$OS-latest` just alias to one of these images.\n\n| Operating System | Supported |\n| ---------------- | --------- |\n| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-22.04` |\n| macOS   | `macos-11`, `macos-12`, `macos-13` |\n| Windows | `windows-2019`, `windows-2022` |\n\nThe prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)\nand on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).\nThe `mingw`, `ucrt` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).\n`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),\n`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder),\n`truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder)\nand `truffleruby+graalvm` is generated by [graalvm-ce-dev-builds](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds).\nThe full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.json](ruby-builder-versions.json)\nfor Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.json](windows-versions.json) for Windows.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Single Job\n\n```yaml\nname: My workflow\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    -

uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n```\n\nNote that any step doing `bundle install` (for the root `Gemfile`) or `gem install bundler` can be removed with `bundler-cache: true`.\n\nThis caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  \nIt needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` or `gems.rb`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  \nIf there is a `Gemfile.lock` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` or `gems.locked`), `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.\n\nTo use a `Gemfile` which is not at the root or has a different name, set `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` in the `env` at the job level\nas shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\n\n#### bundle config\n\nWhen using `bundler-cache: true` you might notice there is no good place to run `bundle config ...` commands.\nThese can be replaced by `BUNDLE_*` environment variables, which are also faster.\nThey should be set in the `env` at the job level as shown in the [example](#matrix-of-gemfiles).\nTo find the correct the environment variable name, see the [Bundler docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-config.1.html) or look at `.bundle/config` after running `bundle config --local KEY VALUE` locally.\nYou might need to `""`-quote the environment variable name in YAML if it has unusual characters like `/`.\n\nTo perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path $PWD/vendor/bundle`.  \nTherefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work (no `bundle config path`).\n\n#### How it Works\n\nWhen there is no lockfile, one is generated with `bundle lock`, which is the same as `bundle install` would do first before actually fetching any gem.\nIn other words, it works exactly like `bundle install`.\nThe hash of the generated lockfile is then used for caching, which is the only correct approach.\n\n#### Dealing with a corrupted cache\n\nIn some rare scenarios (like using gems with C extensions whose functionality depends on libraries found on the system\nat the time of the gem\'s build) it may be necessary to ignore contents of the cache and get and build all the gems anew.\nIn order to achieve this, set the `cache-version` option to any value other than `0` (or change it to a new unique value\nif you have already used it before.)\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n        cache-version: 1\n```\n\n#### Caching `bundle install` manually\n\nIt is also possible to cache gems manually, but this is not recommended because it is verbose and *very difficult* to do correctly.\nThere are many concerns which means using `actions/cache` is never enough for caching gems (e.g., incomplete cache key, cleaning old gems when restoring from another key, correctly hashing the lockfile if not checked in, OS versions, ABI compatibility for `ruby-head`, etc).\nSo, please use `bundler-cache: true` instead and report any issue.\n\n## Windows\n\nNote that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.\nIt is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.\n\n* Use Bundler 2.2.18+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/209#issuecomment-889064123)) by not setting the `bundler:` input and ensuring there is no `BUNDLED WITH 1.x.y` in a checked-in `Gemfile.lock`.\n* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).\n* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.\n* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.\n* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.\n* Use JRuby 9.2.20+ on Windows (older versions have [bugs](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18#issuecomment-889072695)).\n* JRuby on Windows has multiple issues ([jruby/jruby#7106](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7106), [jruby/jruby#7182](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/7182)).\n\n## Versioning\n\nIt is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.\nThis will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.\n\nIf you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and\nit will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.\nMake sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.\n\nThis action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.\nThis follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.\n\n## Using self-hosted runners\n\nThis action might work with [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)\nif the [Runner Image](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) is very similar to the ones used by GitHub runners. Notably:\n\n* Make sure to use the same operating system and version.\n* Make sure to use the same version of libssl.\n* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` and [`libgmp`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555902/ruby-v-dyld-library-not-loaded-usr-local-lib-libgmp-10-dylib) installed\n* The default tool cache directory (`/opt/hostedtoolcache` on Linux, `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache` on macOS,\n  `C:/hostedtoolcache/windows` on Windows) must be writable by the `runner` user.\n  This is necessary since the Ruby builds embed the install path when built and cannot be moved around.\n* `/home/runner` must be writable by the `runner` user.\n\nIn other cases, you will need to install Ruby in the runner tool cache as shown by the action when it detects that case\n(run it so it will show you where to install Ruby).\nYou could of course also not use this action and e.g. use Ruby from a system package or use a Docker image instead.\n\n## History\n\nThis action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.\nPlease [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe current maintainer of this action is @eregon.\nMost of the Windows logic is based on work by MSP-Greg.\nMany thanks to MSP-Greg and Lars Kanis for the help with Ruby Installer.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Just using this:\n```yml\n    - name: Install Qt\n      uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v3\n```\n\nAll done.\n\n## Upgrade Guides\nEach new major version of this project includes changes that can break workflows written to use an older version of\nthis project. These changes are summarized here, to help you upgrade your existing workflows.\n\n[Upgrading `install-qt-action`](README_upgrade_guide.md)\n\n## Options\n\n### `version`\nThe desired version of Qt to install.\n\nYou can also pass in SimpleSpec version numbers, for example `6.2.*`.\n\nDefault: `5.15.2` (Last Qt 5 LTS)\n\n**Please note that for Linux builds, Qt 6+ requires Ubuntu 20.04 or later.**\n\n### `host`\nThis is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It\'s unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.\n\nFor example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.\n\nPossible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`\n\nDefaults to the current platform it is being run on.\n\n### `target`\nThis is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts and Win RT builds are only supported on Windows hosts.\n\nPossible values: `desktop`, `android`, `ios`, or `winrt`\n\nDefault: `desktop`\n\n### `arch`\nThis is the target architecture that your program will be built for.\n\n**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro\'s repository or building it manually.\n\n**Possible values:**\n\nYou can find a full list of architectures easily by using [this awesome website](https://ddalcino.github.io/aqt-list-server/).\n\n**Default values:**\n\nWindows w/ Qt < 5.6: `win64_msvc2013_64`\n\nWindows w/ Qt >= 5.6 && Qt < 5.9: `win64_msvc2015_64`\n\nWindows w/ Qt >= 5.9 && Qt < 5.15: `win64_msvc2017_64`\n\nWindows w/ Qt >= 5.15: `win64_msvc2019_64`\n\nAndroid: `android_armv7`\n\n### `dir`\nThis is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.\n\nFor example, if you set dir to `${{ github.workspace }}/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/example/Qt/5.15.2/{arch}/bin`.\nWhen possible, access your Qt directory through the `QT_ROOT_DIR` environment variable; this will point to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/example/Qt/5.15.2/{arch}` in this case.\n\nDefault: `$RUNNER_WORKSPACE` (this is one folder above the starting directory)\n\n### `install-deps`\nWhether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux through `apt`.\n\nCan be set to `nosudo` to stop it from using sudo, for example on a docker container where the user already has sufficient privileges.\n\nDefault: `true`\n\n### `modules`\nString with whitespace delimited list of additional addon modules to install, with each entry separated by a space. If you need one of these, you\'ll know it.\n\nPossible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, and more\n\nDefault: none\n\n### `archives`\nString with whitespace delimited list of Qt archives to install, with each entry separated by a space. Typically you don\'t need this unless you are aiming for bare minimum installation.

It only exists to preserve backwards compatibility.\nIf you set either `no-qt-binaries` or `tools-only` to `true`, you will skip installation of Qt.\n\nDefault: `false`\n\n### `aqtversion`\n\nVersion of [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall) to use, given in the format used by pip, for example: `==0.7.1`, `>=0.7.1`, `==0.7.*`. This is intended to be used to troubleshoot any bugs that might be caused or fixed by certain versions of aqtinstall.\n\nDefault: `==3.1.*`\n\n### `py7zrversion`\nVersion of py7zr in the same style as the aqtversion and intended to be used for the same purpose.\n\nDefault: `==0.20.*`\n\n### `extra`\nThis input can be used to append arguments to the end of the aqtinstall command for any special purpose.\n\nExample value: `--external 7z`\n\n## Example with all arguments\n\n```yml\n    - name: Install Qt\n      uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v3\n      with:\n        version: \'5.15.2\'\n        host: \'windows\'\n        target: \'desktop\'\n        arch: \'win64_msvc2019_64\'\n        dir: \'${{ github.workspace }}/example/\'\n        install-deps: \'true\'\n        modules: \'qtcharts qtwebengine\'\n        archives: \'qtbase qtsvg\'\n        cache: \'false\'\n        cache-key-prefix: \'install-qt-action\'\n        setup-python: \'true\'\n        tools: \'tools_ifw tools_qtcreator,qt.tools.qtcreator\'\n        set-env: \'true\'\n        tools-only: \'false\'\n        aqtversion: \'==3.1.*\'\n        py7zrversion: \'==0.20.*\'\n        extra: \'--external 7z\'\n```\n\n## More info\nFor more in-depth and certifiably up-to-date documentation, check the documentation for aqtinstall [here](https://aqtinstall.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).\n\nThe Qt bin directory is appended to your `path` environment variable.\n`Qt5_DIR` is also set appropriately for CMake if you are using Qt 5.\nIn addition, `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`, `QML2_IMPORT_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set accordingly. `IQTA_TOOLS` is set to the ""Tools"" directory if tools are installed as well.\n\nSince the Qt bin directory is in your `path`, you will not need to set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` CMake variable.\nIf you wish to do so, you can set it to either `${QT_ROOT_DIR}` or to `${QT_ROOT_DIR}/lib/cmake`.\n\nBig thanks to the [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/) developer for making this easy.

91,"b""# `install-qt-action`\n\nInstalling Qt on Github Actions workflows manually is the worst.\n\nYou know what's easier than dealing with that? Just using this:\n```yml\n    - name: Install Qt\n      uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v2\n```\n\nAll done.\n\n## Options\n\n### `version`\nThe desired version of Qt to install.\n\nDefault: `5.12.6` (Latest LTS at the time of writing)\n\n### `host`\nThis is the host platform of the Qt version you will be installing. It's unlikely that you will need to set this manually if you are just building.\n\nFor example, if you are building on Linux and targeting desktop, you would set host to `linux`. If you are building on Linux and targeting android, you would set host to `linux` also. The host platform is the platform that your application will build on, not its target platform.\n\nPossible values: `windows`, `mac`, or `linux`\n\nDefaults to the current platform it is being run on.\n\n### `target`\nThis is the target platform that you will be building for. You will want to set this if you are building for iOS or Android. \n\n**Please note that iOS builds are supported only on macOS hosts**\n\nPossible values: `desktop`, `android`, or `ios`\n\nDefault: `desktop`\n\n### `arch`\nThis is the target architecture that your program will be built for. This is only used for Windows and Android.\n\n**Linux x86 packages are not supported by this action.** Qt does not offer pre-built Linux x86 packages. Please consider using your distro's repository or building it manually.\n\n**Possible values:**\n\nWindows: `win64_msvc2017_64`, `win64_msvc2015_64`, `win32_msvc2015`, `win32_mingw53`, or `win64_mingw73`\n\nAndroid: `android_x86`, `android_armv7`\n\n**Default values:**\n\nWindows: `win64_msvc2017_64`\n\nAndroid: `android_armv7`\n\n### `dir`\nThis is the directory prefix that Qt will be installed to.\n\nFor example, if you set dir to `/example/`, your bin folder will be located at `/example/Qt/5.12.6/(your_arch)/bin`. When possible, access your Qt directory through the `Qt5_Dir` environment variable.\n\nDefault: `${RUNNER_WORKSPACE}` (this is one folder above the starting directory)\n\n### `install-deps`\nWhether or not to automatically install Qt dependencies on Linux (you probably want to leave this on).\n\nDefault: `true`\n\n### `modules`\nList of additional addon modules to install, with each entry seperated by a space. If you need one of these, you'll know it.\n\nPossible values: `qtcharts`, `qtdatavis3d`, `qtpurchasing`, `qtvirtualkeyboard`, `qtwebengine`, `qtnetworkauth`, `qtwebglplugin`, `qtscript`, `debug_info`, possibly others\n\nDefault: none\n\n### `cached`\nIf it is set to `true`, then Qt won't be downloaded, but the environment variables will be set, and essential build tools will be installed.\n\nIt can be used with [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache), for example:\n\n```\n- name: Cache Qt\n  id: cache-qt\n  uses: actions/cache@v1\n  with:\n    path: ../Qt\n    key: QtCache\n\n- name: Install Qt\n  uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v2\n  with:\n    cached: ${{ steps.cache-qt.outputs.cache-hit }}\n```\n\n### `aqtversion`\n\nVersion of [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall), in the form used by pip, for example: `==0.7.1`, `>=0.7.1`, `==0.7.*`.\n\n## More info\n\nThe Qt bin directory is added to your `path` environment variable. `Qt5_Dir` is also set appropriately for cmake. \n\nBig thanks to the [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/) developers for making this easy.

93,"b'# GitHub Action for Uploading Release Artifacts\n\nThis repository contains a simple GitHub Action implementation which allows you to attach binaries to a new (github) release of your repository.\n\n* [GitHub Action for Uploading Release Artifacts](#github-action-for-uploading-release-artifacts)\n  * [Enabling the action](#enabling-the-action)\n  * [Sample Configuration](#sample-configuration)\n  * [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration)\n  * [GITHUB_TOKEN](#github_token)\n\n\n## Enabling the action\n\nThere are two steps required to use this action:\n\n* Enable the action inside your repository.\n  * This will mean creating a file `.github/workflows/release.yml` which is where the action is invoked.\n  * You\'ll specify a pattern to describe which binary-artifacts are uploaded.\n* Ensure your binary artifacts are generated.\n  * Ideally you should do this in your workflow using another action.\n\n\n## Sample Configuration\n\nThe following configuration file uses _this_ action, along with the [github-action-build](https://github.com/skx/github-action-build) action to generate the artifacts for a project, then attach them to a release.\n\n```yml\non:\n  release:\n    types: [created]\nname: Handle Release\njobs:\n  generate:\n    name: Create release-artifacts\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout the repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@master\n      - name: Generate the artifacts\n        uses: skx/github-action-build@master\n      - name: Upload the artifacts\n        uses: skx/github-action-publish-binaries@master\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        with:\n          args: \'example-*\'\n```\n\nThis is the preferred approach because it uses a pair of distinct actions, each having one job:\n\n* [skx/github-action-build](https://github.com/skx/github-action-build/)\n  * Generates the build artifacts.\n  * i.e. Compiles your binaries.\n* [skx/github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries)\n  * Uploads the previously-generated the build artifacts.\n\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\nThis action is primarily intended to be invoked upon a release-event, which means that Github itself will create a new release, and the action will upload the specified artifacts to that release.\n\nHowever it might be that you wish to **create** a new release within an action, then modify it by populating the content and adding artifacts.   This is possible, because we allow you to specify the ID of the release to which your artifacts should be associated.\n\nYou\'ll want to configure it using something like this:\n\n```yml\n  upload_artifacts:\n    name: Upload Artifacts\n    needs: [create_release]\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Upload the artifacts\n        uses: skx/github-action-publish-binaries@release-1.3\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        with:\n          releaseId: ${{ needs.create_release.outputs.id }}\n          args: \'*.bin\'\n```\n\nHere we\'re explicitly passing the `releaseId` variable, such that the specified release ID will be used.\n\n\n\n## `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n\nYour workflow configuration file, named `.github/workflows/release.yml`, will contain a reference to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, however you do __not__ need to generate that as it is automatically created. You will however need to update your repository settings under `Actions -> General` to give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write access to upload binaries to the release, without write access you will get a `403` response error.\n\n<img width=""894"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19007109/167677568-7c4c942f-b7a3-49af-9470-99605927b123.png"">\n\nYou _can_ inject secrets into workflows, defining them in the project settings, and referring to them by name, but the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value is special and it is handled transparently, requiring no manual setup.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

At least one component is provided in `components` input.\n\nSame to the `profile` input, if installed `rustup` does not supports ""components"",\nit will be automatically upgraded by this Action.\n\n## The toolchain file\n\nThis Action supports [toolchain files](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file),\nso it is not necessary to use `toolchain` input anymore.\n\nInput has higher priority, so if you are want to use toolchain file,\nyou need to remove the input from the workflow file.\n\nIf neither `toolchain` input or `rust-toolchain` file are provided,\nAction execution will fail.\n\n## License\n\nThis Action is distributed under the terms of the MIT license, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/actions-rs/toolchain/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Contribute and support\n\nAny contributions are welcomed!\n\nIf you want to report a bug or have a feature request,\ncheck the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/actions-rs/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nYou can also support author by funding the ongoing project work,\nsee [Sponsoring](https://actions-rs.github.io/#sponsoring).\n'","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
95,"b'# Maven Publish Action\n\n**GitHub Action for automatically publishing Maven packages**\n\n## Overview\n\nThis action\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n- Executes the Maven `deploy` lifecycle phase\n- Provides Maven with your GPG key and passphrase so your artifacts can be signed using `maven-gpg-plugin`\n- Provides Maven with your Nexus credentials so it can deploy and release your project\n\nIt will also use the `deploy` Maven profile if you\'ve defined one (in case you want to perform certain steps only when deploying).\n\n## Setup\n\n### Deployment\n\nIt\'s recommended to publish using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin, which greatly simplifies the process. You can follow [this guide](./docs/deployment-setup.md) for a simple configuration.\n\nMake sure your project is correctly configured for deployment before continuing with the next step.\n\n### Workflow\n\n#### Secrets\n\nIn your project\'s GitHub repository, go to Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. On this page, set the following variables:\n\n- `nexus_username`: Username (not email!) for your Nexus repository manager account\n- `nexus_password`: Password for your Nexus account (or, even better, use the [auth token](https://solidsoft.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/deploy-to-maven-central-using-api-key-aka-auth-token/) instead)\n\nSigning your artifact using GPG is optional, but recommended. If you choose to use GPG, add the following secrets:\n\n- `gpg_private_key`: GPG private key for signing the published artifacts:\n  - Run `gpg --list-secret-keys` and copy the ID of the key you\'d like to use\n  - Export the key with `gpg -a --export-secret-keys KEY_ID` (and replace `KEY_ID` with the ID you copied)\n- `gpg_passphrase`: Passphrase for the GPG key\n\nIf you sign your artifacts, make sure the `maven-gpg-plugin` is configured as described [here](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/action-maven-publish/blob/master/docs/deployment-setup.md#project-configuration).\n\n#### Workflow file\n\nCreate a GitHub workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/release.yml`) in your repository. Use the following configuration, which tells GitHub to use the Maven Publish Action when running your CI pipeline. The steps are self-explanatory:\n\n```yml\nname: Release\n\n# Run workflow on commits to the `master` branch\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Install Java and Maven\n        uses: actions/setup-java@v1\n        with:\n          java-version: 11\n\n      - name: Release Maven package\n        uses: samuelmeuli/action-maven-publish@v1\n        with:\n          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.gpg_private_key }}\n          gpg_passphrase: ${{ secrets.gpg_passphrase }}\n          nexus_username: ${{ secrets.nexus_username }}\n          nexus_password: ${{ secrets.nexus_password }}\n```\n\nThe action will now run every time you push to `master`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn addition to the input variables listed above, the action can be configured with the following options:\n\n- **`directory`:** Directory of the Maven project to deploy. Default: Repository root\n- **`maven_profiles`:** Active Maven profiles. Default: `""deploy""`\n- **`maven_goals_phases`:** Maven goals and build phases to execute. Default: `""clean deploy""`\n- **`maven_args`:** Additional arguments to pass to the Maven command. Default: `""""`\n- **`server_id`:** The default Nexus instance used by this action is OSSRH. If you are deploying to a different Nexus instance, you can specify the server ID you\'ve used in your project\'s POM file (in the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` and `distributionManagement` configurations) here\n\n## Development\n\nSuggestions and contributions are always welcome!

The secret can be named anything you like, but we suggest\n`GITSTAMP_KEYFILE` to match the workflow file above.\n\n## Costs\n\nEach Arweave transaction requires an enclosed transaction fee to pay for\ntransaction processing and permanent storage on the Arweave network.\nIn practice, this works out to less than USD$0.00001 per timestamped commit.\n(In other words, a USD$1 wallet will suffice for at least 100,000 commits.)\n\nThis fee is deducted from the wallet configured in the repository secrets.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [Arweave JS](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js)\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `wallet-key`\n\nThe Arweave wallet key to use for signing transactions and paying\ntransaction fees.\n\n## `commit-link`\n\nA boolean indicating whether to include a GitHub commit link.\nDefaults to `false` for privacy reasons.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `transaction-id`\n\nThe Arweave transaction ID.\n\nFor example, `guSFLDoc3dvdeZg-fBCp6uLeLHb_gGLCW__eefqtHM0`.\n\n### `transaction-link`\n\nThe Arweave transaction explorer link on [ViewBlock.io](https://viewblock.io).\n\nFor example, <https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/guSFLDoc3dvdeZg-fBCp6uLeLHb_gGLCW__eefqtHM0>.\n\n### `response-code`\n\nThe Arweave HTTP API response status code.\n\n### `response-text`\n\nThe Arweave HTTP API response status text.\n\n## See Also\n\nThis repository is mirrored on [GitHub], [GitLab], and [Bitbucket].\n\n[GitHub Action]:  https://github.com/features/actions\n[Arweave]:        https://www.arweave.org\n[Arweave wallet]: https://www.arweave.org/wallet\n[GitHub]:         https://github.com/weavery/gitstamp-action\n[GitLab]:         https://gitlab.com/weavery/gitstamp-action\n[Bitbucket]:      https://bitbucket.org/weavery/gitstamp-action\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
97,"b'# GitHub Action - Issue Label Notifications\nThis GitHub Action allows you to notify users or teams when specific labels are added to an issue. It runs every time a label is attached to an issue, and compares the label to the list of notification recipients that you specify. If a match is found, the action will add a comment to the issue and @mention the notification recipients.\n\n![Screen Shot 2020-03-27 at 3 30 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1865328/77805832-19b91800-7040-11ea-98c8-5eb880be04f7.png)\n\n## Usage\n### Pre-requisites\nCreate a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n### Inputs\n- `recipients`: A map of labels and which individuals or teams to notify.

100,"b""# release-gem\n\nGithub action that bumps the version, generates the changelog, releases the gem, and creates a Github release,\n\nThis action uses the [conventional_changelog](https://github.com/dcrec1/conventional-changelog-ruby) gem to update the CHANGELOG.md file, and the [bump](https://github.com/gregorym/bump) gem to handle the version increments. It assumes that the repository is using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The gem dependencies in the action are managed independently from the dependencies of the gem that is being released.\n\nFeel free to use this action for gems outside the Pact Foundation, however, its intent is only for Pact Foundation gems, so if you want to make any changes, please fork it and maintain your own version.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your workflow YAML file:\n\n```\nname: Release gem\n\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types:\n      - release-triggered\n\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      with:\n        fetch-depth: 0\n    - uses: pact-foundation/release-gem@v0.0.11\n      env:\n        GEM_HOST_API_KEY: '${{ secrets.RUBYGEMS_API_KEY }}'\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'\n        INCREMENT: '${{ github.event.client_payload.increment }}'\n```\n\nYou will need to create the `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` secret yourself, however, the GITHUB_TOKEN is provided by default.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

See [token](#token) for further details. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| `repository` | The full name of the repository to send the dispatch. | `github.repository` (current repository) |\n| `event-type` | (**required**) A custom webhook event name. | |\n| `client-payload` | JSON payload with extra information about the webhook event that your action or workflow may use. | `{}` |\n\n#### Token\n\nThis action creates [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event) events.\nThe default `GITHUB_TOKEN` token can only be used if you are dispatching the same repository that the workflow is executing in.\n\nTo dispatch to a remote repository you must create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the `repo` scope and store it as a secret.\nIf you will be dispatching to a public repository then you can use the more limited `public_repo` scope.\n\nYou can also use a [fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) (beta). It needs the following permissions on the target repositories:\n - `contents: read & write`\n - `metadata: read only` (automatically selected when selecting the contents permission)\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example setting all of the input parameters.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Repository Dispatch\n        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: username/my-repo\n          event-type: my-event\n          client-payload: \'{""ref"": ""${{ github.ref }}"", ""sha"": ""${{ github.sha }}""}\'\n```\n\nHere is an example `on: repository_dispatch` workflow to receive the event.\nNote that repository dispatch events will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow is committed to the default branch.\n\n```yml\nname: Repository Dispatch\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [my-event]\njobs:\n  myEvent:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ github.event.client_payload.ref }}\n      - run: echo ${{ github.event.client_payload.sha }}\n```\n\n### Dispatch to multiple repositories\n\nYou can dispatch to multiple repositories by using a [matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix). In the following example, after the `build` job succeeds, an event is dispatched to three different repositories.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  build:\n    # Main workflow job that builds, tests, etc.\n\n  dispatch:\n    needs: build\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        repo: [\'my-org/repo1\', \'my-org/repo2\', \'my-org/repo3\']\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Repository Dispatch\n        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: ${{ matrix.repo }}\n          event-type: my-event\n```\n\n## Client payload\n\nThe GitHub API allows a maximum of 10 top-level properties in the `client-payload` JSON.\nIf you use more than that you will see an error message like the following.\n\n```\nNo more than 10 properties are allowed; 14 were supplied.\n```\n\nFor example, this payload will fail because it has more than 10 top-level properties.\n\n```yml\nclient-payload: ${{ toJson(github) }}\n```\n\nTo solve this you can simply wrap the payload in a single top-level property.\nThe following payload will succeed.\n\n```yml\nclient-payload: \'{""github"": ${{ toJson(github) }}}\'\n```\n\nAdditionally, there is a limitation on the total data size of the `client-payload`. A very large payload may result in a `client_payload is too large` error.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Here\'s [a blog post](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-life-of-a-github-action/) describing this action in more detail.\n\n> **NOTE:** This will **never** delete the repository\'s default branch or protected branches. If the pull request is closed _without_ merging, it will **not** delete it.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n<!-- toc -->\n\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n  * [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)\n\n<!-- tocstop -->\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nworkflow ""on pull request merge, delete the branch"" {\n  on = ""pull_request""\n  resolves = [""branch cleanup""]\n}\n\naction ""branch cleanup"" {\n  uses = ""jessfraz/branch-cleanup-action@master""\n  secrets = [""GITHUB_TOKEN""]\n}\n```\n\nIf you include this in another Workflow, you may want to configure the environment variable `NO_BRANCH_DELETED_EXIT_CODE`. The default value for this is `78`, as Github Actions will mark a check as ""neutral"" (neither failed/succeeded) when you exit with code 78. This will however **cancel** any other actions running in parallel in this workflow.\n\nIf you don\'t want it to cancel, configure your workflow as follows:\n\n```\naction ""branch cleanup"" {\n  uses = ""jessfraz/branch-cleanup-action@master""\n  secrets = [""GITHUB_TOKEN""]\n\n  env = {\n    NO_BRANCH_DELETED_EXIT_CODE = ""0""\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![demo](demo.png)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Running the tests\n\nThe tests use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

You may find `step.if` field helpful in accomplishing this\nas it maximizes the reuse value of your workflow for non-tag pushes.\n\nBelow is a simple example of `step.if` tag gating\n\n```yaml\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Release\n        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n        if: startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags/\')\n```\n\nYou can also use push config tag filter\n\n```yaml\nname: Main\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - ""v*.*.*""\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Release\n        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n```\n\n### \xe2\xac\x86\xef\xb8\x8f Uploading release assets\n\nYou can configure a number of options for your\nGitHub release and all are optional.\n\nA common case for GitHub releases is to upload your binary after its been validated and packaged.\nUse the `with.files` input to declare a newline-delimited list of glob expressions matching the files\nyou wish to upload to GitHub releases. If you\'d like you can just list the files by name directly.\n\nBelow is an example of uploading a single asset named `Release.txt`\n\n```yaml\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Build\n        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > Release.txt\n      - name: Test\n        run: cat Release.txt\n      - name: Release\n        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n        if: startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags/\')\n        with:\n          files: Release.txt\n```\n\nBelow is an example of uploading more than one asset with a GitHub release\n\n```yaml\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Build\n        run: echo ${{ github.sha }} > Release.txt\n      - name: Test\n        run: cat Release.txt\n      - name: Release\n        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n        if: startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags/\')\n        with:\n          files: |\n            Release.txt\n            LICENSE\n```\n\n> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note:** Notice the `|` in the yaml syntax above \xe2\x98\x9d\xef\xb8\x8f. That let\'s you effectively declare a multi-line yaml string. You can learn more about multi-line yaml syntax [here](https://yaml-multiline.info)\n\n> **\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Note for Windows:** Paths must use `/` as a separator, not `\\`, as `\\` is used to escape characters with special meaning in the pattern; for example, instead of specifying `D:\\Foo.txt`, you must specify `D:/Foo.txt`. If you\'re using PowerShell, you can do this with `$Path = $Path -replace \'\\\\\',\'/\'`\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x93\x9d External release notes\n\nMany systems exist that can help generate release notes for you. This action supports\nloading release notes from a path in your repository\'s build to allow for the flexibility\nof using any changelog generator for your releases, including a human \xf0\x9f\x91\xa9\xe2\x80\x8d\xf0\x9f\x92\xbb\n\n```yaml\nname: Main\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Generate Changelog\n        run: echo ""# Good things have arrived"" > ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt\n      - name: Release\n        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n        if: startsWith(github.ref, \'refs/tags/\')\n        with:\n          body_path: ${{ github.workspace }}-CHANGELOG.txt\n          # note you\'ll typically need to create a personal access token\n          # with permissions to create releases in the other repo\n          token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        env:\n          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: my_gh_org/my_gh_repo\n```\n\n### \xf0\x9f\x92\x85 Customizing\n\n#### inputs\n\nThe following are optional as `step.with` keys\n\n| Name                       | Type    | Description

108,"b""# pip-action\n[![Test](https://github.com/BSFishy/pip-action/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BSFishy/pip-action/actions)\n\nThis action installs pip packages.\n\n## Usage\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\nBasic:\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v1\n- uses: BSFishy/pip-action@v1\n  with:\n    packages: |\n      package1\n      package2\n- run: python main.py\n```\n\nAll options:\n```yaml\n- uses: BSFishy/pip-action@v1\n  with:\n    packages: package\n    requirements: requirements.txt\n    constraints: constraints.txt\n    no-deps: true\n    pre: true\n    editable: editable\n    platform: ':all:'\n    upgrade: true\n    extra: extra options\n```\n\n### Options\nHere is a list of all of the available options supported by this action.\n\n#### `packages`\nThe packages to install.\nThis option can replace the `requirements` input or `editable` input, but either this, the `requirements` option, or the `editable` option is required.\n\nA list can be provided to specify multiple packages.\nThis syntax is a little different because actions only support string inputs.\nDue to this, each individual package can have no whitespace except around it.\n\nThis option does not correspond to any additional command flags, as none are necessary.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\n## Valid inputs\npackages: package1         # python -m pip install package1\npackages: package1==1.0.0  # python -m pip install package1==1.0.0\n\npackages: package1 package2                # python -m pip install package1 package2\npackages: package1==1.0.0 package2         # python -m pip install package1==1.0.0 package2\npackages: package1==1.0.0 package2==1.2.3  # python -m pip install package1==1.0.0 package2==1.2.3\n\n# python -m pip install package1\npackages: |\n  package1\n# python -m pip install package1==1.0.0\npackages: |\n  package1==1.0.0\n# python -m pip install package1 package2\npackages: |\n  package1\n  package2\n# python -m pip install package1==1.0.0 package2\npackages: |\n  package1==1.0.0\n  package2\n# python -m pip install package1==1.0.0 package2==1.2.3\npackages: |\n  package1==1.0.0\n  package2==1.2.3\n\n## Invalid inputs\npackages: package1 == 1.0.0\n\npackages: |\n  package1 == 1.0.0\n```\n\n#### `requirements`\nA [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) to install from.\nThis option can replace the `packages` input or `editable` input, but either this, the `packages` option, or the `editable` option is required.\n\nThe input value should be a valid requirements file to install from.\nIt corresponds to the `--requirement` argument for pip.\nAny valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.\n\nNo special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.\nThe value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nrequirements: ''                    # python -m pip install package1\nrequirements: requirements.txt      # python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt\nrequirements: src/requirements.txt  # python -m pip install --requirement src/requirements.txt\n```\n\n#### `constriants`\nA [constraints file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files) to install from.\nThis can be used to specify the versions of packages that are allowed to be installed.\nIt does **not** do anything to actually install new packages.\n\nThe input should be a valid constraints file to use.\nIt corresponds to the `--constraint` argument for pip.\nAny valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.\n\nNo special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.\nThe value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nconstraints: ''                   # python -m pip install package1\nconstraints: constraints.txt      # python -m pip install --constraint constraints.txt package1\nconstraints: src/constraints.txt  # python -m pip install --constraint src/constraints.txt package1\n```\n\n#### `no-deps`\nSpecify not to install package dependencies.\nThis will cause only the packages specified to be installed, and none of their dependencies.\n\nIt corresponds to the `--no-deps` argument for pip.\n\nIt is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nno-deps: true   # python -m pip install --no-deps package1\nno-deps: false  # python -m pip install package1\n```\n\n#### `pre`\nSpecify to install development or pre-release versions of packages.\nThis will allow the latest version of the package to be isntalled rather than the stable version.\n\nIt corresponds to the `--pre` argument for pip.\n\nIt is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\npre: true   # python -m pip install --pre package1\npre: false  # python -m pip install package1\n```\n\n#### `editable`\nInstall a package in editable mode.\nThis option can replace the `packages` input or `requirements` input, but either this, the `packages` option, or the `requirements` option is required.\n\nThe input should be a valid package to install.\nIt corresponds to the `--editable` argument for pip.\nAny valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.\n\nNo special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.\nThe value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\neditable: ''                                              # python -m pip install package1\neditable: path/to/SomeProject                             # python -m pip install --editable path/to/SomeProject\neditable: git+http://repo/my_project.git#egg=SomeProject  # python -m pip install --editable git+http://repo/my_project.git#egg=SomeProject\n```\n\n#### `platform`\nOnly install packages compatible with a specific platform.\nThis will default to the platform currently running.\n\nThe input should be a valid platform.\nIt corresponds to the [`--platform` argument for pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#cmdoption-platform).\nAny valid value for that argument will be valid for this option.\n\nNo special formatting is done with this input, so it won't be treated special.\nThe value recieved from this input will be passed directly to pip.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nplatform: ''                         # python -m pip install package1\nplatform: linux_x86_64               # python -m pip install --platform linux_x86_64 package1\nplatform: linux_ubuntu_18_04_x86_64  # python -m pip install --platform linux_ubuntu_18_04_x86_64 package1\n```\n\n#### `upgrade`\nSpecify to upgrade packages.\nThis will cause already installed packages to be upgraded if an upgrade is available.\n\nIt corresponds to the `--upgrade` argument for pip.\n\nIt is a boolean input, so either `true` or `false` will work as inputs.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nupgrade: true   # python -m pip install --upgrade package1\nupgrade: false  # python -m pip install package1\n```\n\n#### `extra`\nSpecify additional arguments to pass to pip.\nThese are extra options that may not be provided by independent inputs to this action.\n\nIt does not correspond to any pip arguments.\nThe input is passed directly to pip without any formatting.\n\n**Examples:**\n```yaml\nextra: ''      # python -m pip install package1\nextra: --user  # python -m pip install --user package1\n```\n\n### Additional info\nHere is just a little bit of additional information to explain some things that may not be trivial.\n\n#### Python location\nIt is highly recommended that you use the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action to install Python.\nThis streamlines the process and makes sure that you have a valid Python installed and located.\n\nThis action will automatically detect if Python is installed in 1 of two ways.\nFirstly, it checks the `pythonLocation` environment variable.\nThis is set by the `setup-python` action, and is a directory pointing to the Python installation.\n\nSecondly, if the `setup-python` action is not used, the path will be checked for Python.\nIf Python is found in the path environment variable, this action will use that version.\nOtherwise, an error is thrown.\n\n#### Empty strings\nEmpty strings are used to signify no input.\nGithub Actions only allow string key/value inputs, so inputs are always strings.\nInputs that are not specified automatically return an empty string.\nBecause of this, we use an empty string to signify an input has no value.\nFor most options, this will cause the argument to not appear in the final command.\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The\naction is able to act on pull request and push events and check the pull\nrequest title and body, or the commit message of the commits of a push.\n\nOn pull requests the title and body are concatenated, delimited by two line\nbreaks.\n\nDesigned to be very flexible in usage, you can split checks into various\nworkflows, use action types on pull request to listen on, define branches\nfor pushes etc. etc.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee also [action definition](action.yml) and the following example workflow.\n\nMore information about `pattern` and `flags` can be found in the\n[JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).\n\n`flags` is optional and defaults to `gm`.\n\n`excludeDescription`, `excludeTitle` and `checkAllCommitMessages` are optional.\nDefault behavior is to include the description and title and not check pull\nrequest commit messages.\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n```yml\nname: \'Commit Message Check\'\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - edited\n      - reopened\n      - synchronize\n  pull_request_target:\n    types:\n      - opened\n      - edited\n      - reopened\n      - synchronize\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - \'releases/*\'\n\njobs:\n  check-commit-message:\n    name: Check Commit Message\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check Commit Type\n        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v2\n        with:\n          pattern: \'\\[[^]]+\\] .+$\'\n          flags: \'gm\'\n          error: \'Your first line has to contain a commit type like ""[BUGFIX]"".\'\n      - name: Check Line Length\n        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v2\n        with:\n          pattern: \'^[^#].{74}\'\n          error: \'The maximum line length of 74 characters is exceeded.\'\n          excludeDescription: \'true\' # optional: this excludes the description body of a pull request\n          excludeTitle: \'true\' # optional: this excludes the title of a pull request\n          checkAllCommitMessages: \'true\' # optional: this checks all commits associated with a pull request\n          accessToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # github access token is only required if checkAllCommitMessages is true\n      - name: Check for Resolves / Fixes\n        uses: gsactions/commit-message-checker@v2\n        with:\n          pattern: \'^.+(Resolves|Fixes): \\#[0-9]+$\'\n          error: \'You need at least one ""Resolves|Fixes: #<issue number>"" line.\'\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting and debugging\n\nMost of the questions being asked here are not about bugs or missing features in\nthis action, but about not enough information about what is going on in the\nbackground. A good first starting point is to [enable debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)\nfor the action, which can be accomplished by adding secrets to your repository.\nAfter that, many additional information will appear in the logs and you should\nbe able to set up your configuration properly.\n\nThere are some really good tools that you can use to set up your pattern\nproperly for your needs. My favorite tool is <https://regexr.com/> which works\nvery well with this action.\n\nIf you need additional support, please head to the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GsActions/commit-message-checker/discussions)\nof this repository.\n\n## Development\n\n### Quick Start\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/gsactions/commit-message-checker.git\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThat\'s it, just start editing the sources...\n\n### Commands\n\nBelow is a list of commands you will probably find useful during the development\ncycle.\n\n#### `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the package to the `lib` folder.\n\n#### `npm run format`\n\nRuns Prettier on .ts and .tsx files and fixes errors.\n\n#### `npm run format-check`\n\nRuns Prettier on .ts and .tsx files without fixing errors.\n\n#### `npm run lint`\n\nRuns Eslint on .ts and .tsx files.\n\n#### `npm run pack`\n\nBundles the package to the `dist` folder.\n\n#### `npm run test`\n\nRuns Jest test suites.\n\n#### `npm run all`\n\nRuns all the above commands.\n\n### Debugging\n\nMore information about debugging GitHub Actions can be found at <https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-debugging.md>.\n\nThe secrets `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` are both set to\n`true` in the main repository.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is released under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
110,"b'### Project Archived\nThis project has been archived and is no longer actively maintaned, but will continue to function.\n\n\xe2\x9e\xa1\xef\xb8\x8f [GitHub is now able to automatically generate release notes for your GitHub releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)\n\n# generate-changelog-action\n\nGitHub Action for [lob/generate-changelog](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/). Intended to be used with [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release).\n\nCreated during the GitHub Actions Hackathon 2020 and [selected as one of the winning projects!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL6mjJXGt3-75GejQCubsOvWwtYcGaqbJA7msnsh7Tg/edit#gid=0&range=A100:C100)\n\n## Usage\n\n**Note:** [Your repository must contain a `package.json` file](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/issues/38#issuecomment-362726723), although an empty file such as [the one in this repository](https://github.com/ScottBrenner/generate-changelog-action/blob/master/package.json) is fine.\n\nIf your `package.json` isn\'t available in root directory of your repository, you can pass the path of the `package.json` file by setting `package-dir` as follows:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Changelog\n  uses: scottbrenner/generate-changelog-action@master\n  id: Changelog\n  with:\n    package-dir: \'root/to/my/package.json\'\n```\n\nBy default, this Action generates changelogs using commits between the previous tag and the most recent tag. Generate changelogs from specific tag or range (e.g. `v1.2.3` or `v1.2.3..v1.2.4`) by passing the `from-tag` and `to-tag` inputs. An example is when your release tag on git is generated after the changelog so you must use something like `git log v1..HEAD --oneline`:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Changelog\n  uses: scottbrenner/generate-changelog-action@master\n  id: Changelog\n  with:\n    from-tag: v1.0\n    to-tag: HEAD\n```\n\nThis Action additionally supports the following inputs, in accordance with [lob/generate-changelog\'s CLI options](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog/#cli).\n| Property                  | Default       | Description                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `package-dir`             | `package.json`| The path for the package.json if it is not in root                                                                            |\n| `from-tag`                | ""last tag""    | The tag to generate changelog from. If not set, fallbacks to git last tag -1. Ex.: v1.0                                       |\n| `to-tag`                  | ""current tag"" | The tag to generate changelog up to. If not set, fallbacks to git last tag.   Ex.: v2.0                                       |\n| `type`                    | Unset         | The type of changelog to generate: patch, minor, or major. If not set, fallbacks to unset.                                    |\n| `exclude`                 | Unset         | Exclude selected commit types (comma separated). If not set, fallbacks to unset.                                              |\n| `allow-unknown`           | Unset         | Allow unknown commit types. If not set, fallbacks to unset.\n\nFor more information, see [actions/create-release: Usage](https://github.com/actions/create-release#usage), [lob/generate-changelog: Usage](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog#usage), and [jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith).\n\n\n## Example workflow - create a release\nSee [this repository\'s release.yml](https://github.com/ScottBrenner/generate-changelog-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) for an example workflow which extends [actions/create-release: Example workflow - create a release](https://github.com/actions/create-release#example-workflow---create-a-release) to generate a changelog from git commits and use it as the body for the GitHub release.\n\nThis workflow automatically creates [this repository\'s releases](https://github.com/ScottBrenner/generate-changelog-action/releases).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
111,"b'# action-kodi-addon-checker\n\n![Kodi Logo](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/raw/master/docs/resources/banner_slim.png)\n\nThis action automatically runs [kodi-addon-checker](https://github.com/xbmc/addon-check) against your addon codebase. It checks the Kodi repo for best practices and produces a report containing found problems and warnings.\nThe action assumes you have your addon in the root path of your repository.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `kodi-version`\n\n**Required** The name of the minimal kodi version your addon is supposed to support (Default `""leia""`).\nThis is equivalent to the **branch** name where your addon lives in the official kodi repository ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/branches) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts/branches)).\n\n\n### `addon-id`\n\n**optional** The addon id of the addon being validated. This is used to extract the addon package using `git archive` and respect your `.gitattributes`. If not provided, the addon-check will allow folder id mismatching (by passing `--allow-folder-id-mismatch` to the tool).\n\n### `is-pr`\n\n**optional** If the action is being run as part of a pull request validation, normally used when the action is used as a step in automated submissions (Default `false`).\n\n## `rewrite-for-matrix`\n\n**optional** If the addon.xml should be re-written for kodi matrix - usefull if you are using the same branch to submit to two different branches (Default `false`).\n\n## Example usage\n\nTo use this action in your github repository you need to have your addon code in the root directory of your github repository and name your repository accordingly (e.g. plugin.video.foo). The following example performs the addon validation on each git push or pull request taking into account you plan to submit your addon to the `leia` branch. The addon id is automatically extracted from your repository name.\n\n```yaml\nname: Kodi Addon-Check\n\non: [push, pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  kodi-addon-checker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    name: Kodi addon checker\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v1\n    - name: Kodi addon checker validation\n      id: kodi-addon-checker\n      uses: xbmc/action-kodi-addon-checker@v1.1\n      with:\n        kodi-version: leia\n        is-pr: false\n        addon-id: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}\n\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
112,"b'# action-kodi-addon-submitter\n\n![Kodi Logo](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/raw/master/docs/resources/banner_slim.png)\n\nThis action submits your addon to the official Kodi repository every time you push a tag. In the background it uses [xbmc\'s kodi-addon-submitter](https://github.com/xbmc/kodi-addon-submitter).\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `kodi-repository`\n\n**Required** The name of the repository to where you want to submit the addon. Values can be ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts)). Defaults to `repo-plugins`.\n\n### `kodi-version`\n\n**Required** The name of the minimal kodi version your addon is supposed to support. Default `""leia""`.\nThis is equivalent to the **branch** name where your addon lives in the official kodi repository ([repo-plugins](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/branches) or [repo-scripts](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-scripts/branches)).\n\n### `addon-id`\n\n**Required** The id of your addon as defined in [addon.xml](https://kodi.wiki/view/Addon.xml).\n\n### `kodi-matrix`\n\n**Optional** Boolean indicating if a Python 2/3 compatible addon will be submitted to the `matrix` branch in addition to the target branch. This can be used if you want to update a Python 2/3 compatible addon both in `matrix` (Kodi 19.x) and a lower branch at the same time. Do not use this option if you want to submit a Python 3 addon only to `matrix` branch. Use the `kodi-repository` input for this.\n\n### `sub-directory`\n\n**Optional** Boolean indicating if the addon is stored in its own directory within the git repo.\n\n## Secrets\n\n### `GH_TOKEN`\n\n**Required** A secret in your addon github repository that contains a github token with at least public_repo scope.\n\n### `EMAIL`\n\n**Required** A secret containing your email address. This is used in `git config` to submit the pull request.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `addon-zip`\n\nPath to the addon release zip file\n\n### `addon-zip-matrix`\n\nPath to the addon release zip file for matrix (if `kodi-matrix` input is `true`). This zip uses PEP440 local version identifier.\n\n## Example usage\n\nThe below configuration will automatically submit your addon to the kodi repository when you create a new tag/release. For instance, supposing your addon update is version `1.0.1`:\n\n`git tag v1.0.1 && git push --tags`\n\nThe configuration below assumes you are submitting an addon with id `plugin.video.example` to the branch `leia` of `repo-plugins`.\n\n```yaml\nname: Kodi Addon-Submitter\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - v*\n\njobs:\n  kodi-addon-submitter:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    name: Kodi addon submitter\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v1\n    - name: Generate distribution zip and submit to official kodi repository\n      id: kodi-addon-submitter\n      uses: xbmc/action-kodi-addon-submitter@v1.3\n      with: # Replace all the below variables\n        kodi-repository: repo-plugins\n        kodi-version: leia\n        addon-id: plugin.video.example\n        kodi-matrix: false # Submit a Python 2/3 compatible addon to matrix branch in addition to the target branch\n        sub-directory: false\n      env: # Make sure you create the below secrets (GH_TOKEN and EMAIL)\n        GH_USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n        GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GH_TOKEN}}\n        EMAIL: ${{secrets.EMAIL}}\n```\n\nThe configuration below automatically submits the addon to the same repository but also creates a github release and uploads the distribution zip to the github releases section of your github repository.\n\n\n```yaml\nname: Kodi Addon-Submitter\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - v*\n\njobs:\n  kodi-addon-submitter:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    name: Kodi addon submitter\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v1\n    - name: Generate distribution zip and submit to official kodi repository\n      id: kodi-addon-submitter\n      uses: xbmc/action-kodi-addon-submitter@v1.3\n      with: # Replace all the below values\n        kodi-repository: repo-plugins\n        kodi-version: leia\n        addon-id: plugin.video.example\n        kodi-matrix: false # Submit a Python 2/3 compatible addon to matrix branch in addition to the target branch\n        sub-directory: false\n      env: # Make sure you create the below secrets (GH_TOKEN and EMAIL)\n        GH_USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n        GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GH_TOKEN}}\n        EMAIL: ${{secrets.EMAIL}}\n    - name: Create Github Release\n      id: create_release\n      uses: actions/create-release@v1.0.0\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      with:\n        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}\n        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}\n        draft: false\n        prerelease: false\n    - name: Upload Addon zip to github release\n      id: upload-release-asset\n      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1.0.1\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      with:\n        upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}\n        asset_path: ${{ steps.kodi-addon-submitter.outputs.addon-zip }}\n        asset_name: ${{ steps.kodi-addon-submitter.outputs.addon-zip }}\n        asset_content_type: application/zip\n\n```\n\n**Note:** The idea of generating a distribution zip is to automatically exclude some of your files from the submission (e.g. tests, .gitignore, .gitattributes, etc). This can be accomplished if you store a `.gitattributes` file on the root of your repository containing the following:\n\n```\n.gitignore export-ignore\n.gitattributes export-ignore\n.github export-ignore\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Once you\'re satisfied that it\'s working the way you expect,\nyou can create a workflow file and implement this as an action on your repo.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nYou need to add a workflow file into your repository under\n[.github/workflows](./.github/workflows), just like any other Github Action.\nThis workflow file [follows the standard workflow syntax for Github Actions.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).\n\nA sample workflow file for you to use as a drop-in is in [sample_workflow.yml](./sample_workflow.yml).\n\nFor a list of options and their description, see [action.yml](./action.yml).\n\nHere\'s an abbreviated example with just the step for this action:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: aws-actions/stale-issue-cleanup@v3\n  with:\n    # Types of issues that will be processed\n    issue-types: issues,pull_requests\n\n    # Messages this action will apply to issues\n    stale-issue-message: Stale issue message\n    stale-pr-message: Stale pr message\n    ancient-issue-message: Ancient issue message\n    ancient-pr-message: Ancient pr message\n\n\n    # Labels this action will apply to issues\n    stale-issue-label: closing-soon\n    exempt-issue-labels: awaiting-approval\n    stale-pr-label: no-pr-activity\n    exempt-pr-labels: awaiting-approval\n    response-requested-label: response-requested\n    closed-for-staleness-label: closed-for-staleness\n\n    # Issue timing and upvote counting\n    days-before-stale: 4\n    days-before-close: 7\n    days-before-ancient: 365\n    minimum-upvotes-to-exempt: 10\n\n    # Testing/debugging options\n    loglevel: DEBUG\n    dry-run: true\n\n    # Leave this alone, or set to a PAT for the action to use\n    repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n**NOTE:** For stability, you should use the action with either an\nexplicit tag, or commit SHA:\n\n`uses: aws-actions/stale-issue-cleanup@v3` \n\n## License Summary\n\nThis code is made available under the Apache-2.0 license.\nSee [LICENSE](./LICENSE).\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Set the `contents`-permission of the default GITHUB_TOKEN to `true`. (Required to push new commits to the repository)\n2. Add the following step at the end of your job, after other steps that might add or change files.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n```\n\nYour Workflow should look similar to this example.\n\n```yaml\nname: Format\n\non: push\n\njobs:\n  format-code:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions:\n      # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the\n      # added or changed files to the repository.\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      # Other steps that change files in the repository\n\n      # Commit all changed files back to the repository\n      - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n```\n\n> **Note**  \n> The Action has to be used in a Job that runs on a UNIX system (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`).\n\nThe following is an extended example with all available options.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n  with:\n    # Optional.

If you\'re using the Action in a job in combination with a custom Docker container, make sure that `bash` is installed.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\nIn this example, we\'re running `php-cs-fixer` in a PHP project to fix the codestyle automatically, then commit possible changed files back to the repository.\n\nNote that we explicitly specify `${{ github.head_ref }}` in the checkout Action.\nThis is required in order to work with the `pull_request` event (or any other non-`push` event).\n\n```yaml\nname: php-cs-fixer\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  php-cs-fixer:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    permissions:\n      # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the changed files back to the repository.\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      with:\n        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}\n\n    - name: Run php-cs-fixer\n      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga\n\n    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n      with:\n        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\nCheckout [`action.yml`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/blob/master/action.yml) for a full list of supported inputs.\n\n## Outputs\n\nYou can use these outputs to trigger other Actions in your Workflow run based on the result of `git-auto-commit-action`.\n\n- `changes_detected`: Returns either ""true"" or ""false"" if the repository was dirty and files have changed.\n- `commit_hash`: Returns the full hash of the commit if one was created.\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\n  - name: ""Run if changes have been detected""\n    if: steps.auto-commit-action.outputs.changes_detected == \'true\'\n    run: echo ""Changes!""\n\n  - name: ""Run if no changes have been detected""\n    if: steps.auto-commit-action.outputs.changes_detected == \'false\'\n    run: echo ""No Changes!""\n```\n\n## Limitations & Gotchas\n\nThe goal of this Action is to be ""the Action for committing files for the 80% use case"". Therefore, you might run into issues if your Workflow falls into the not supported 20% portion.\n\nThe following is a list of edge cases the Action knowingly does not support:\n\n**No `git pull` when the repository is out of date with remote.** The Action will not do a `git pull` before doing the `git push`. **You** are responsible for keeping the repository up to date in your Workflow runs. \n\n**No support for running the Action in build matrices**. If your Workflow is using build matrices, and you want that each job commits and pushes files to the remote, you will run into the issue, that the repository in the workflow will become out of date. As the Action will not do a `git pull` for you, you have to do that yourself.\n\n**No support for `git rebase` or `git merge`**. There are many strategies on how to integrate remote upstream changes to a local repository. `git-auto-commit` does not want to be responsible for doing that. \n\n**No support for detecting line break changes between CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed)**. This is a low level issue, you have to resolve differently in your project. Sorry.\n\nIf this Action doesn\'t work for your workflow, check out [EndBug/add-and-commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit).\n\n### Checkout the correct branch\n\nYou must use `action/checkout@v2` or later versions to check out the repository.\nIn non-`push` events, such as `pull_request`, make sure to specify the `ref` to check out:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  with:\n    ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}\n```\n\nDo this to avoid checking out the repository in a detached state.\n\n### Commits made by this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs\n\nThe resulting commit **will not trigger** another GitHub Actions Workflow run.\nThis is due to [limitations set by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow).\n\n> When you use the repository\'s GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.\n\nYou can change this by creating a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new),\nstoring the token as a secret in your repository and then passing the new token to the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) Action step.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  with:\n    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n```\n\nIf you create a personal access token, apply the `repo` and `workflow` scopes.\n\nIf you work in an organization and don\'t want to create a PAT from your personal account, we recommend using a [robot account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts) for the token.\n\n### Change to file is not detected\n\nDoes your workflow change a file, but ""git-auto-commit"" does not detect the change? Check the `.gitignore` that applies to the respective file. You might have accidentally marked the file to be ignored by git.\n\n## Advanced Uses\n\n### Multiline Commit Messages\n\nIf your commit message should span multiple lines, you have to create a separate step to generate the string. \n\nThe example below can be used as a starting point to generate a multiline commit meesage. Learn more how multiline strings in GitHub Actions work in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#multiline-strings).\n\n```yaml\n    # Building a multiline commit message\n    # Adjust to your liking\n    - run: echo ""Commit Message 1"" >> commitmessage.txt\n    - run: echo ""Commit Message 2"" >> commitmessage.txt\n    - run: echo ""Commit Message 3"" >> commitmessage.txt\n\n    # Create a multiline string to be used by the git-auto-commit Action\n    - name: Set commit message\n      id: commit_message_step\n      run: |\n        echo \'commit_message<<EOF\' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n        cat commitmessage.txt >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n        echo \'EOF\' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n    # Quick and dirty step to get rid of the temporary file holding the commit message\n    - run: rm -rf commitmessage.txt\n\n    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n      id: commit\n      with:\n        commit_message: ${{ steps.commit_message_step.outputs.commit_message }}\n```  \n\n### Signing Commits & Other Git Command Line Options\n\nUsing command lines options needs to be done manually for each workflow which you require the option enabled. So for example signing commits requires you to import the gpg signature each and every time. The following list of actions are worth checking out if you need to automate these tasks regularly.\n\n- [Import GPG Signature](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) (Suggested by [TGTGamer](https://github.com/tgtgamer))\n\n### Push to forks from private repositories\n\nBy default, GitHub Actions doesn\'t run Workflows on forks from private repositories. To enable Actions for **private** repositories enable ""Run workflows from pull requests"" in your repository settings.\n\nSee [this announcement from GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/) or the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) for details.\n\n\n### Use in forks from public repositories\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand to learn more</summary>\n\n> **Note**   \n> This Action technically works with forks. However, please note that the combination of triggers and their options can cause issues. Please read [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) on which triggers GitHub Actions support.\\\n> Ensure your contributors enable ""Allow edits by maintainers"" when opening a pull request. ([Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)) \\\n> \\\n> **If you use this Action in combination with a linter/fixer, it\'s easier if you run the Action on `push` on your `main`-branch.**\n\n> **Warning**   \n> Due to limitations of GitHub, this Action currently can\'t push commits to a base repository, if the fork _lives_ under an organisation. See [github/community#6634](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/5634) and [this comment](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/211#issuecomment-1428849944) for details.\n\nBy default, this Action will not run on Pull Requests which have been opened by forks. (This is a limitation by GitHub, not by us.)   \nHowever, there are a couple of ways to use this Actions in Workflows that should be triggered by forked repositories.\n\n### Workflow should run in **base** repository\n\nThe workflow below runs whenever a commit is pushed to the `main`-branch or when activity on a pull request happens, by listening to the  [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event.\n\nIf the workflow is triggered by the `pull_request_target`-event, the workflow will run in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, as the `pull_request` event does.\nIn other words, this will allow your workflow to be run in the repository where the pull request is opened to and will push changes back to the fork.\n\nCheck out the discussion in [#211](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/211) for more information on this.\n\n```yaml\nname: Format PHP\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request_target:\n\njobs:\n  php-cs-fixer:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      with:\n        # Checkout the fork/head-repository and push changes to the fork.\n        # If you skip this, the base repository will be checked out and changes\n        # will be committed to the base repository!\n        repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}\n\n        # Checkout the branch made in the fork. Will automatically push changes\n        # back to this branch.\n        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}\n\n    - name: Run php-cs-fixer\n      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga\n\n    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n```\n\n### Workflow should run in **forked** repository\n\n> **Warning**   \n> **This part of the documentation is outdated.**   \n> We were not able to configure a GitHub Action workflow for forks, that the workflow would run in the fork / head repository.\n> Please let us know in the [discussions](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/discussions)-area, if and how you achieved that.\n\nIf the workflow should run in the forked repository, follow these steps:\n\n1. In addition to listening to the `pull_request` event in your Workflow triggers, you have to add an additional event: `pull_request_target`. You can learn more about this event in [the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target).\n2. GitHub Action has to be enabled on the forked repository. \\\nFor security reasons, GitHub does not automatically enable GitHub Actions on forks. The user has to explicitly enable GitHub Actions in the ""Actions""-tab of the forked repository. (Mention this in your projects README or CONTRIBUTING.md!)\n\nAfter you have added the `pull_request_target` to your desired Workflow and the forked repository has enabled Actions and a new Pull Request is opened, the Workflow will run **on the forked repository**.\n\nDue to the fact that the Workflow is not run on the repository the Pull Request is opened in, you won\'t see any status indicators inside the Pull Request.\n\n#### Example\n\nThe following workflow runs `php-cs-fixer` (a code linter and fixer for PHP) when a `pull_request` is opened. We\'ve added the `pull_request_target`-trigger too, to make it work for forks.\n\n```yaml\nname: Format PHP\n\non: [push, pull_request, pull_request_target]\n\njobs:\n  php-cs-fixer:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Run php-cs-fixer\n      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga\n\n    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n      with:\n        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes\n```\n\nNext time a user forks your project **and** enabled GitHub Actions **and** opened a Pull Request, the Workflow will run on the **forked** repository and will push commits to the same branch.\n\nHere\'s how the Pull Request will look like:\n\n![Screenshot of a Pull Request from a Fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1080923/90955964-9c74c080-e482-11ea-8097-aa7f5161f50e.png)\n\n\nAs you can see, your contributors have to go through hoops to make this work. **For Workflows which run linters and fixers (like the example above) we recommend running them when a push happens on the `main`-branch.**\n\n\nFor more information about running Actions on forks, see [this announcement from GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/).\n\n</details>\n\n### Using `--amend` and `--no-edit` as commit options\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand to learn more</summary>\n\nIf you would like to use this Action to create a commit using [`--amend`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend) and [`--no-edit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---no-edit) you need to make some adjustments.\n\n> **Warning**   \n> You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend a commit that has already been published. [See rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_recovering_from_upstream_rebase).\n\nFirst, you need to extract the previous commit message by using `git log -1 --pretty=%s`.\nThen you need to provide this last commit message to the Action through the `commit_message` input option.\n\nFinally, you have to use `push_options: \'--force\'` to overwrite the git history on the GitHub remote repository. (git-auto-commit will not do a `git-rebase` for you!)\n\nThe steps in your workflow might look like this:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@master\n  with:\n    # Fetch the last 2 commits instead of just 1. (Fetching just 1 commit would overwrite the whole history)\n    fetch-depth: 2\n\n# Other steps in your workflow to trigger a changed file\n\n- name: Get last commit message\n  id: last-commit-message\n  run: |\n    echo ""msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%s)"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n  with:\n    commit_message: ${{ steps.last-commit-message.outputs.msg }}\n    commit_options: \'--amend --no-edit\'\n    push_options: \'--force\'\n    skip_fetch: true\n```\n\nSee discussion in [#159](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/159#issuecomment-845347950) for details.\n\n</details>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n### Action does not push commit to repository\n\nMake sure to [checkout the correct branch](#checkout-the-correct-branch).\n\n### Action does not push commit to repository: Authentication Issue\n\nIf your Workflow can\'t push the commit to the repository because of authentication issues,\nplease update your Workflow configuration and usage of [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).\n\nUpdating the `token` value with a Personal Access Token should fix your issues.\n\n### Push to protected branches\n\nIf your repository uses [protected branches](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-protected-branches) you have to make some changes to your Workflow for the Action to work properly: You need a Personal Access Token and you either have to allow force pushes or the Personal Access Token needs to belong to an Administrator.\n\nFirst, you have to create a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new),\nstore the token as a secret in your repository and pass the new token to the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) Action step.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  with:\n    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n```\nYou can learn more about Personal Access Token in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).\n\n> **Note**\n> If you\'re working in an organisation, and you don\'t want to create the PAT from your personal account, we recommend using a bot-account for such tokens.\n\n\nIf you go the ""force pushes"" route, you have to enable force pushes to a protected branch (See [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-force-pushes-to-a-protected-branch)) and update your Workflow to use force push like this.\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n      with:\n        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes\n        push_options: --force\n```\n\n### No new workflows are triggered by the commit of this action\n\nThis is due to limitations set up by GitHub, [commits made by this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs](#commits-made-by-this-action-do-not-trigger-new-workflow-runs).\n\n### Pathspec \'x\' did not match any files\n\nIf you\'re using the Action with a custom `file_pattern` and the Action throws a fatal error with the message ""Pathspec \'file-pattern\' did not match any files"", the problem is probably that no file for the pattern exists in the repository.\n\n`file_pattern` is used both for `git-status` and `git-add` in this Action. `git-add` will throw a fatal error, if for example, you use a file pattern like `*.js *.ts` but no `*.ts` files exist in your projects\' repository.\n\nSee [Issue #227](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/227) for details.\n\n### Custom `file_pattern`, changed files but seeing ""Working tree clean. Nothing to commit."" in the logs\n\nIf you\'re using a custom `file_pattern` and the Action does not detect the changes made in your worfklow, you\'re probably running into a globbing issue.\n\nLet\'s imagine you use `file_pattern: \'*.md\'` to detect and commit changes to all Markdown files in your repository.\nIf your Workflow now only updates `.md`-files in a subdirectory, but you have an untouched `.md`-file in the root of the repository, the git-auto-commit Action will display ""Working tree clean. Nothing to commit."" in the Workflow log.\n\nThis is due to the fact, that the `*.md`-glob is expanded before sending it to `git-status`. `git-status` will receive the filename of your untouched `.md`-file in the root of the repository and won\'t detect any changes; and therefore the Action does nothing.\n\nTo fix this add `disable_globbing: true` to your Workflow.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4\n  with:\n    file_pattern: \'*.md\'\n    disable_globbing: true\n```\n\nSee [Issue #239](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/239) for details.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nThe Action has tests written in [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core). Before you can run the test suite locally, you have to install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`.\n\n```shell\nnpm install\nyarn\n```\n\nYou can run the test suite with `npm` or `yarn`.\n\n```shell\nnpm run test\nyarn test\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/tags).\n\nWe also provide major version tags to make it easier to always use the latest release of a major version. For example, you can use `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4` to always use the latest release of the current major version.\n(More information about this [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#versioning-your-action).)\n\n## Credits\n\n* [Stefan Zweifel](https://github.com/stefanzweifel)\n* [All Contributors](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/graphs/contributors)\n\nThis Action has been inspired and adapted from the [auto-commit](https://github.com/cds-snc/github-actions/tree/master/auto-commit\n)-Action of the Canadian Digital Service and this [commit](https://github.com/elstudio/actions-js-build/blob/41d604d6e73d632e22eac40df8cc69b5added04b/commit/entrypoint.sh)-Action by Eric Johnson.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
120,"b'# Issue Manager\n\nAutomatically close issues or Pull Requests that have a **label**, after a **custom delay**, if no one replies back.\n\n## How to use\n\nInstall this GitHub action by creating a file in your repo at `.github/workflows/issue-manager.yml`.\n\nA minimal example could be:\n\n```yml\nname: Issue Manager\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""0 0 * * *""\n  issue_comment:\n    types:\n      - created\n  issues:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  pull_request_target:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\njobs:\n  issue-manager:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: tiangolo/issue-manager@0.4.0\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          config: \'{""answered"": {}}\'\n```\n\nThen, you can answer an issue or PR and add the label from the config, in this case, `answered`.\n\nAfter 10 days, if no one has added a new comment, the GitHub action will write:\n\n```markdown\nAssuming the original need was handled, this will be automatically closed now.\n```\n\nAnd then it will close the issue.\n\nBut if someone adds a comment _after_ you added the label, this GitHub Action will remove the label so that you can come back and check it instead of closing it.\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use any file name you want, `issue-manager.yml` is just a suggestion. But it has to be inside of `.github/workflows/` and have a `.yml` extension.\n\nIf you check, the `config` in that file `issue-manager.yml` above has a `string`, and inside the string there\'s a whole JSON configuration:\n\n```JSON\n{""answered"": {}}\n```\n\n...but it\'s all inside a `string`:\n\n```YAML\n\'{""answered"": {}}\'\n```\n\nThis JSON configuration (inside a string) is what allows us to add multiple custom labels, with different delays, and different messages.\n\nImagine this JSON config:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    ""answered"": {\n        ""delay"": ""P3DT12H30M5S"",\n        ""message"": ""It seems the issue was answered, closing this now.""\n    },\n    ""validated"": {\n        ""delay"": 300,\n        ""message"": ""The issue could not be validated after 5 minutes. Closing now.""\n    },\n    ""waiting"": {\n        ""delay"": 691200,\n        ""message"": ""Closing after 8 days of waiting for the additional info requested.""\n    },\n    ""needs-tests"": {\n      ""delay"": 691200,\n      ""message"": ""This PR will be closed after waiting 8 days for tests to be added. Please create a new one with tests.""\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, if:\n\n* the issue has a label `answered`\n* the label was added _after_ the last comment\n* the last comment was written more than 3 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes and 5 seconds ago\n\n...the GitHub action would close the issue with a message of:\n\n```markdown\nIt seems the issue was answered, closing this now.\n```\n\nBut if there was a new comment created _after_ the label was added, by default, it would remove the label.\n\n---\n\nBut then, if:\n\n* the issue has a label `validated`\n* the label was added _after_ the last comment\n* the last comment was written more than `300` seconds ago (5 minutes)\n\n...the GitHub action would close the issue with a message:\n\n```markdown\nThe issue could not be validated after 5 minutes. Closing now.\n```\n\nAnd also, if there was a new comment created _after_ the label was added, by default, it would remove the label.\n\n---\n\nThen, if:\n\n* the issue has a label `waiting`\n* the label was added _after_ the last comment\n* the last comment was addded more than `691200` seconds (8 days) ago\n\n...the GitHub action would close the issue with:\n\n```markdown\nClosing after 10 days of waiting for the additional info requested.\n```\n\nAnd again, by default, removing the label if there was a new comment written after adding the label.\n\n---\n\nAnd finally, if:\n\n* a PR has a label `needs-tests`\n* the label was added _after_ the last comment\n* the last comment was addded more than `691200` seconds (8 days) ago\n\n...the GitHub action would close the PR with:\n\n```markdown\nThis PR will be closed after waiting 8 days for tests to be added. Please create a new one with tests.\n```\n\n**Note**: in this last example the process is applied to a PR instead of an issue. The same logic applies to both issues and PRs. If you want a label to only apply to issues, you should use that label only with issues, and the same with PRs.\n\n### Delay\n\nThe delay can be configured using [anything supported by Pydantic\'s `datetime`](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#datetime-types).\n\nSo, it can be an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) period format (like `P3DT12H30M5S`), or the number of seconds between the two dates (like `691200`, or 10 days) plus other options.\n\n### Remove label on comment\n\nYou can also pass a config `remove_label_on_comment` per keyword. By default, it\'s `true`.\n\nWhen someone adds a comment _after_ the label was added, then this GitHub action won\'t close the issue.\n\nOn top of not closing the issue, by default, it will remove the label. You can disable removing the label by setting `remove_label_on_comment` to `false`.\n\n### Remove label on close\n\nAfter this GitHub action closes an issue it can also automatically remove the label from the issue when you pass the config `remove_label_on_close` set to `true`.\n\nBy default it is false, and doesn\'t remove the label from the issue.\n\n### Defaults\n\nBy default, any config has:\n\n* `delay`: A delay of 10 days.\n* `message`: A message of:\n\n```markdown\nAssuming the original issue was solved, it will be automatically closed now.\n```\n\n* `remove_label_on_comment`: True. If someone adds a comment after you added the label, it will remove the label from the issue.\n* `remove_label_on_close`: False. After this GitHub action closes the issue it would also remove the label from the issue.\n\n### Config in the action\n\nTo use that same JSON config from above, you would have to put it on a single `string` inside the GitHub Action config (`issue-manager.yml`).\n\nBut YAML supports multiline strings using `>`.\n\nJust make sure to indent everything to be part of the same string.\n\nSo, you can put all the config with:\n\n```yml\nname: Issue Manager\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""0 0 * * *""\n  issue_comment:\n    types:\n      - created\n      - edited\n  issues:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  pull_request_target:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\njobs:\n  issue-manager:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: tiangolo/issue-manager@0.4.0\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          config: >\n            {\n                ""answered"": {\n                    ""delay"": ""P3DT12H30M5S"",\n                    ""message"": ""It seems the issue was answered, closing this now.""\n                },\n                ""validated"": {\n                    ""delay"": 300,\n                    ""message"": ""The issue could not be validated after 5 minutes. Closing now.""\n                },\n                ""waiting"": {\n                    ""delay"": 691200,\n                    ""message"": ""Closing after 8 days of waiting for the additional info requested.""\n                }\n            }\n```\n\n### Edit your own config\n\nIf you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or another modern editor, you can create your JSON config by creating a JSON file, e.g. `config.json`.\n\nThen writing the contents of your config in that file, and then copying the results.\n\nBut you can do it all with autocomplete :rocket:.\n\nYou can start your JSON config file with:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    ""$schema"": ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiangolo/issue-manager/master/schema.json""\n}\n```\n\nAnd then after you write a keyword and start its config, like `""answered"": {}`, it will autocomplete the internal config keys, like `delay`, `message`. And will validate its contents.\n\nIt\'s fine to leave the `$schema` in the `config` on the `.yml` file, it will be discarded and won\'t be used as a label.\n\n### A complete example\n\n**Note**: you probably don\'t need all the configs, the examples above should suffice for most cases. But if you want to make the GitHub action _not_ remove the labels if someone adds a new comment, this can help as an example:\n\n```yml\nname: Issue Manager\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""0 0 * * *""\n  issue_comment:\n    types:\n      - created\n      - edited\n  issues:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  pull_request_target:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\njobs:\n  issue-manager:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: tiangolo/issue-manager@0.4.0\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          config: >\n            {\n                ""$schema"": ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiangolo/issue-manager/master/schema.json"",\n                ""answered"": {\n                    ""delay"": ""P3DT12H30M5S"",\n                    ""message"": ""It seems the issue was answered, closing this now."",\n                    ""remove_label_on_comment"": false,\n                    ""remove_label_on_close"": false\n                },\n                ""validated"": {\n                    ""delay"": 300,\n                    ""message"": ""The issue could not be validated after 5 minutes. Closing now."",\n                    ""remove_label_on_comment"": true,\n                    ""remove_label_on_close"": false\n                },\n                ""waiting"": {\n                    ""delay"": 691200,\n                    ""message"": ""Closing after 8 days of waiting for the additional info requested."",\n                    ""remove_label_on_comment"": true,\n                    ""remove_label_on_close"": true\n                }\n            }\n```\n\n## GitHub Action triggers\n\nIf you check the examples above, they have a section that says when to run the GitHub action:\n\n```yml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: ""0 0 * * *""\n  issue_comment:\n    types:\n      - created\n      - edited\n  issues:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  pull_request_target:\n    types:\n      - labeled\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n* The `cron` option means that the GitHub action will be run every day at 00:00 UTC.\n* The `issue_comment` option means that it will be run with a specific issue when a comment is added.\n    * This way, if there\'s a new comment, it can immediately remove any label that was added before the new comment.\n* The `issues` option with a type of `label` will run it with each specific issue when you add a label.\n    * This way you can add a label to an issue that was answered long ago, and if the configured delay since the last comment is enough the GitHub action will close the issue right away.\n* The `pull_request_target` option with a type of `label` will run it with each specific Pull Request made to your repo when you add a label.\n    * This way you can add a label to a PR that was answered long ago, or that was waiting for more comments from the author, etc. And if the configured delay since the last comment is enough the GitHub action will close the issue right away.\n* The `workflow_dispatch` option allows you to run the action manually from the GitHub Actions tab for your repo.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Closing early\n\nWhen I answer an issue, I like to give the original user some time to respond and give them the chance to close the issue before doing it myself.\n\nOr sometimes, I have to request additional info.\n\nSometimes, my answer didn\'t respond the real question/problem, and if I closed the issue immediately, it would end up feeling ""impolite"" to the user.\n\nMoreover, if I closed the issue prematurely, there\'s a smaller chance that I (or someone else) will revisit it again to answer the real question/problem.\n\n### Not closing\n\nBut then, if I leave the issue open after giving an answer, in many cases, the issue will keep open until I come back to close it, after many days.\n\nThen, after that time (10 days, 30 days) and after seeing that there are no new comments, I write ""I assume the problem is solved, closing this issue now"".\n\nBut that requires me going through all the open issues again, one by one, check where I (or someone else) have already answered, typing that message, etc.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nOne option would be to use a tool that closes stale issues, like [probot/stale](https://github.com/probot/stale), or the [Close Stale Issues Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues).\n\nBut if the user came back explaining that my answer didn\'t respond to his/her problem or giving the extra info requested, but I couldn\'t respond on time, the issue would still go ""stale"" and be closed.\n\n## What Issue Manager does\n\nThis action allows the repo owner to add a label (e.g. `answered`) to an issue after answering. Or multiple labels with multiple configurations (multiple messages, delays, etc).\n\nThen, this action, by running every night (or however you configure it) will, for each open issue:\n\n* Check if the issue has one of the configured labels.\n* Check if the label was added _after_ the last comment.\n* If not, remove the label (configurable).\n* Check if the current date-time is more than the configured *delay* to wait for the user to reply back (configurable).\n* Then, if all that matches, it will add a comment with a message (configurable).\n* And then it will close the issue.\n\nIt will also run after each comment or label added, with the specific issue that has the new comment or label (if you used the example configurations from above).\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### Latest Changes\n\n\n### 0.4.0\n\n* \xe2\x9c\xa8 Add support for managing PRs and remove support for HTML comments to avoid rate limits.

124,"b'# GitHub Action for Creating a Release on Tag push\n\nCreates a new GitHub release whenever a tag is pushed.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe following basic workflow will create a release whenever any tag is pushed that matches the version_regex.\n\n```yaml\nname: Release\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - ""v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+""\n\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Create GitHub release\n        uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@v3\n        with:\n          version_regex: ^v[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Limiting versions and creating pre-releases\n\nIf only certain tags should create releases or some releases should be created as pre-release you can set regular expression to achieve this.\nThese regular expression are evaluated with GNU grep, so these regular expressions need to be compatible with it.\nRegular expressions containing `\\` need them to be escaped with `\\\\`.\n\n- `version_regex` Regular expression to verify that the version is in a correct format. Defaults to `.*` (accept everything).\n- `prerelease_regex` Any version matching this regular expression will be marked as pre-release. Disabled by default.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Create GitHub release\n  uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@v3\n  with:\n    version_regex: ^v[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\n    prerelease_regex: ""^v2\\\\.[[:digit:]]+\\\\.[[:digit:]]+""\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Passing a tag to not rely on manual tag pushes\n\nIf you want to create a tag automatically and create the release in the same workflow you can set `created_tag` to achieve this.\nThis allows you to create a fully automated release in one workflow file (workaround because one workflow/action can not trigger another workflow/action).  \nThe example below uses `K-Phoen/semver-release-action` to create the tag whenever a pull request is closed, merged, and the head_ref starts with RC.\nAfter the tag is created it is passed to the create-release-action via the CREATED_TAG env variable using the output of the `semver-release-action`.\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: closed\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.event.pull_request.merged && startsWith(github.head_ref, \'RC\')\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Tag and prepare release\n        id: tag_and_prepare_release\n        uses: K-Phoen/semver-release-action@v1.3.1\n        with:\n          release_branch: master\n          release_strategy: tag\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Upload release notes\n        if: steps.tag_and_prepare_release.outputs.tag\n        uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@v3\n        with:\n          created_tag: ${{ steps.tag_and_prepare_release.outputs.tag }}\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Using the tag message as release body\n\nIf you have tag messages that you want to use as a release body you can pass them from the workflow with the `release_text` parameter.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- name: ""Refresh tags""\n  id: tag\n  run: git fetch --tags --force # Is currently required for v3 due to https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/290\n- uses: ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action@v3\n  id: tag-data\n- name: Create GitHub release\n  uses: Roang-zero1/github-create-release-action@v3\n  with:\n    version_regex: ^v[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\n    release_text: ${{ steps.tag-data.outputs.git-tag-annotation }}\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Change log parsing\n\nThis action makes it possible to extract the release description from a Markdown change log.\n\nBy default, the `CHANGELOG.md` file is searched for a `##` (h2) heading matching the tag text.\n\nIf it is found the section is passed as body to the release API.\n\nIf for example we release the tag `v1.0.0` with a `CHANGELOG.md` as follows:\n\n```Markdown\n# Changelog\n\n## v1.0.0\n\nInitial Release\n```\n\nThen the text `Initial Release` will be passed as body.\nMarkdown restrictions for release bodies still apply.\n\n_Parsed change logs with will have the new lines (/r, /n) and percent symbols (%) escaped._\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `version_regex`\n\nRegular expression to verify that the version is in a correct format. Defaults to `.*` (accept everything).\n\n### `prerelease_regex`\n\nAny version matching this regular expression will be marked as pre-release. Disabled by default.\n\n### `create_draft`\n\nCreate the releases as draft (`true|false [default: false]`). Existing will not be updated from released to draft.\n\n### `update_existing`\n\nControls whether an existing release should be updated with data from the latest push (`true|false [default: false]`).\n\n### `created_tag`\n\nAllows to pass an already created tag.\n\n### `release_title`\n\nAllows to pass a release title.\n\n### `changelog_file`\n\nFile that contains the Markdown formatted change log. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n\n### `changelog_heading`\n\nHeading level at which the tag headings exist. Defaults to `h2`, this parses headings at the markdown level `##`.\n\n## Outputs\n\n### `id`\n\nID number of the created or updated release.\n\n### `html_url`\n\nHTML access URL for the created or updated release.\n\n### `upload_url`\n\nArtifact upload URL for the created or updated release.\n\n### `changelog`\n\nText of the parsed change log entry.\n\n## Secrets\n\n- `GITHUB_TOKEN` Provided by GitHub action, does not need to be set.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

127,"b""# Cake for GitHub Actions\n\n[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cake-build/cake-action?label=Marketplace&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cake-action) [![GitHub Actions Build](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/actions?workflow=Build) [![GitHub Actions Tests](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action/actions?workflow=Tests) [![Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cake-build/cake-action/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/cake-build/cake-action?branch=master)\n\nThis action allows you to run a Cake script from your GitHub Actions workflow without having to use a [bootstrapper](https://github.com/cake-build/resources).\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing the Cake action from a GitHub Actions workflow is as simple as referencing [this repository](https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action) from a [build step](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps):\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n```\n\nThe Cake action will look for a script named `build.cake` in your repository's root directory and run it for you using the [Cake Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/). All output from the Cake script will be automatically redirected to the build log for inspection.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `script-path`\n\nIf your script is in another location, you can specify the path with the `script-path` [input parameter](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith):\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      script-path: path/to/script.cake\n```\n\n### `target`\n\nYou'll likely want to specify which task to run out of the ones defined in the Cake script. For that, you can use the `target` parameter:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      target: Task-To-Run\n```\n\n### `verbosity`\n\nYou can adjust the amount of information Cake sends to the build log by changing the [verbosity level](https://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Core.Diagnostics/Verbosity/) with the `verbosity` parameter:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      verbosity: Diagnostic\n```\n\nThe supported verbosity levels are `Quiet`, `Minimal`, `Normal`, `Verbose` and `Diagnostic`. The default level is set to `Normal`.\n\n### `dry-run`\n\nWhile developing a script, you'll sometimes want to see which tasks would be triggered by a given target _without_ actually running them. That's exactly what the `dry-run` parameter is for:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      dry-run: true\n```\n\nWhen `dry-run` is set to `true`, Cake will print out the names of the tasks to run according to the dependency graph, but it won't perform any of the instructions defined in them.\n\n### `arguments`\n\nIf your script defines any custom parameters, you can specify arguments for them by using the `arguments` parameter:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      arguments: |\n        name: value\n        configuration: Release\n```\n\nThe arguments are defined in a [multi-line string literal](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688) where each argument is on a separate line in the format `name: value`. Keep in mind that the values you specify here are passed _as is_ to the Cake script; this means that characters like quotes are kept intact (for example, `name: 'value'` will result in `--name='value'` being passed to the script).\n\n### `cake-version`\n\nBy default, the Cake action will run your script using the latest _stable_ version of the [Cake .NET Core Global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/). However, if for some reason you want to [use a specific version of Cake](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version) (for compatibility with older third-party addins, for example), you can do so by specifying the version number in the `cake-version` parameter:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      cake-version: 0.30.0\n```\n\nIf you're pinning your Cake version using a [tool manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-local-tool), then you can have the action restore any local tools, including Cake, by specifying `tool-manifest` as the argument for `cake-version`:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n    with:\n      cake-version: tool-manifest\n```\n\n### `cake-bootstrap`\n\nAs of [Cake 1.0.0](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/releases/tag/v1.0.0), any [custom modules](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/modules) that you reference in your script are [bootstrapped automatically](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/2833) upon running it.\n\nIf you're using an older version of Cake, however, you need to explicitly [bootstrap](https://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/preprocessor-directives#module-directive) them before running the script. The Cake action can take care of this extra step for you by setting the `cake-bootstrap` parameter to `explicit`:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v2\n    with:\n      cake-bootstrap: explicit\n      cake-version: 0.38.5\n```\n\nIf you're using Cake 1.0.0 or later and wish to opt out of the automatic bootstrapping of modules, you can do so by setting the `cake-bootstrap` parameter to `skip`:\n\n```yml\nsteps:\n  - name: Run the Cake script\n    uses: cake-build/cake-action@v2\n    with:\n      cake-bootstrap: skip\n```\n\nThe default value is `auto`, which means that the modules will be automatically bootstrapped on Cake 1.0.0 or later.\n\n## Cross-platform\n\nSince the [Cake Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/) is built on .NET Core, the Cake action will run on any of the [virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions) supported by GitHub Actions, namely Linux, Windows and macOS.\n\nThis allows you to define your build step exactly _once_ and run it on multiple operating systems _in parallel_ by defining a [build matrix](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix):\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest]\n    steps:\n      - name: Get the sources\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - name: Run the build script\n        uses: cake-build/cake-action@v1\n        with:\n          target: Build\n```\n\nYou can read more about how to define a build matrix in the [workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy) for GitHub Actions.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.\n\nThis is straight out of [GitHub\'s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#create-a-check-run).\n\nPut simply, **this action will not work on pull requests from a forked repository**, making it basically useless for open source repositories.\n\n**PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ACTION**, and instead follow [the Rails way](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4a78dcb326e57b5035c4df322e31875bfa74ae23/.github/workflows/rubocop.yml#L1).\n\n## Quickstart\n\n> IMPORTANT: This action does not run `bundle install` by default. In order to install gems via bundler, you will need to update your configuration file. See more below.\n\nThe default usage, similar to running `gem install rubocop && rubocop` from your command line:\n\n```yaml\n- name: RuboCop Linter Action\n  uses: andrewmcodes/rubocop-linter-action@v3.3.0\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis GitHub Action provides a way to easily run RuboCop on your codebase, and output the results to the view via [GitHub Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks)\n\nWhile it is **recommended** to write a custom GitHub Action to run RuboCop on your codebase, this action takes that functionality one step further using Checks. After the RuboCop Linter Action runs RuboCop against your Ruby code, it will create annotations that you can easily view in the GitHub UI, matched up with the offending code.\n\nAt this point the Checks API has been in beta over two years, and it is still possible that there will be breaking API changes that affect this action. If this occurs, please open a pull request to fix it.\n\n**Are you sure you need this action?**\n\nI would truly recommend **not** using this action. The potential for random breaking changes from GitHub will always be a looming threat and I have ascertained people are using this action as a crutch to avoid what they really ought be doing.\n\nIf you find yourself constantly having to wade through RuboCop errors in GitHub, the fix is to not allow them to get to GitHub broken in the first place. I would highly suggest using a tool like [lefthook](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook) or similar to flag or fix failing cops before they get to GitHub Actions, saving you and your team time and removing the need for this action.\n\n## Usage\n\n- [RuboCop Linter Action](#rubocop-linter-action)\n  - [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n  - [Usage](#usage)\n    - [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n    - [Configuration](#configuration)\n    - [Inputs](#inputs)\n    - [Simple Config](#simple-config)\n    - [Default Config](#default-config)\n    - [Version Constraints](#version-constraints)\n    - [Spec](#spec)\n    - [Usage](#usage-1)\n    - [Example Workflow](#example-workflow)\n    - [Updates](#updates)\n    - [RuboCop Docs](#rubocop-docs)\n    - [FAQ](#faq)\n  - [Config options](#config-options)\n    - [exit_on_failure](#exit_on_failure)\n  - [Community](#community)\n    - [Changelog](#changelog)\n    - [Contributing](#contributing)\n    - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n    - [License](#license)\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![RuboCop Linter File Annotation][image2]\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Another Screenshot \xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8f</summary>\n\n![RuboCop Linter Checks Overview][image1]\n\n</details>\n\n### Configuration\n\n### Inputs\n\n**`action_config_path`**\n\n**Defintion**\n\nThe only input accepted for the action, which allows you to specify a custom location for the action config file.\n\n**Default**\n\n`.github/config/rubocop_linter_action.yml`\n\n### Simple Config\n\nThis is simple config file showing how you could choose to change the version numbers, but use defaults for the rest:\n\n```yml\n# .github/config/rubocop_linter_action.yml\n\nversions:\n  - rubocop-rails\n  - rubocop-performance: ""1.5.1""\n  - rubocop-minitest: ""latest""\n  - rubocop-rspec: ""1.37.0""\n```\n\n### Default Config\n\n```yml\n# .github/config/rubocop_linter_action.yml\n\n# Description: The name of the check that will be created.\n# Valid Options: A reasonably sized string.\n# Default: \'RuboCop Action\'\ncheck_name: ""RuboCop Results""\n\n# Description: Versions required to run your RuboCop checks.\n# Valid options: RuboCop and any RuboCop extension, by default the latest gem version will be used.

To easily upgrade your config, use [mry](https://github.com/pocke/mry).\n\n### RuboCop Docs\n\nSeveral of the config options map directly to RuboCop\'s inputs. Check [their documentation](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage/#command-line-flags) for help or more info.\n\n### FAQ\n\n_If you cannot find an answer here that you think should be included, let us know!!_\n\n**1. Why is my check result being shown under the wrong header?**\n\nThere is a bug with Checks that might cause your runs to get jumbled in the UI, but they will all still run and render annotations in the diff correctly. Hopefully this will get fixed or we figure out that we are doing something wrong that is fixable.\n\n**2. How come I can\'t create checks on forked repositories? [(example)](https://github.com/ruby/spec/commit/1cfa9f188e8342993d149807210b6777189cfe3f/checks?check_suite_id=335929828)**\n\n> NOTE: The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty pull_requests array.\n\nThis is straight out of GitHub\'s documentation. Put simply, this action won\'t work correctly on pull requests from a forked repository as is.\n\nI am open to a PR that will just output the results of the RuboCop run to the actions log if someone would like to take a shot at adding that!\n\n**3. The modified flag is not working!**\n\nIf you specify the following in your config file:\n\n```yaml\ncheck_scope: ""modified""\n```\n\nPlease note that this will not work on commits to master. If you have an idea on how to make this work, please open an issue or PR!\n\n**4. My GitHub Checks results don\'t match the output of running RuboCop locally.**\n\nMake sure you\'re running the same version of RuboCop that the linter is using. If using Bundler, try running `bundle update rubocop`. If you need the linter to use an older version, you can specify it in the config file:\n\n```yaml\nversions:\n  - rubocop: ""0.88.0""\n```\n\n## Config options\n\n### exit_on_failure\n\nStop the workflow execution if the linter returns some failures.\n\n```yaml\n- name: RuboCop Linter Action\n  uses: andrewmcodes/rubocop-linter-action@v3.3.0\n  with:\n    exit_on_failure: true\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Community\n\n### Changelog\n\n[View our Changelog][changelog]\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please limit to bug fixes.

See [Configuring Docker for use with GitHub Package Registry](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-package-registry/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-package-registry#publishing-a-package) for more information.  \nFor publishing to GitHub Container Registry please see [Migrating to GitHub Container Registry for Docker images](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images).\n\nIf you\'re using GitHub Packages Docker or GitHub Container Registry, you might also want to use `${{ github.actor }}` as the `username`.  \n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: owner/repository/image\n  username: ${{ github.actor }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  registry: ghcr.io\n```\n\n### snapshot\nUse `snapshot` to push an additional image, which is tagged with  \n`{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}{HOUR}{MINUTE}{SECOND}{first 6 digits of the git sha}`.  \nThe date was inserted to prevent new builds with external dependencies override older builds with the same sha.\nWhen you would like to think about versioning images, this might be useful.  \n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  snapshot: true\n```\n\n### default_branch\nUse `default_branch` when you want to use a different branch than `master` as the default branch.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  default_branch: trunk\n```\n\n### dockerfile\nUse `dockerfile` when you would like to explicitly build a Dockerfile.  \nThis might be useful when you have multiple DockerImages.  \n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  dockerfile: MyDockerFileName\n```\n\n### workdir\nUse `workdir` when you would like to change the directory for building.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  workdir: mySubDirectory\n```\n\n### context\nUse `context` when you would like to change the Docker build context.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  context: myContextDirectory\n```\n\n### buildargs\nUse `buildargs` when you want to pass a list of environment variables as [build-args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg). Identifiers are separated by comma.   \nAll `buildargs` will be masked, so that they don\'t appear in the logs.  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n  env:\n    MY_FIRST: variableContent\n    MY_SECOND: variableContent\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    buildargs: MY_FIRST,MY_SECOND\n```\n\n### buildoptions\nUse `buildoptions` when you want to configure [options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for building.  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    buildoptions: ""--compress --force-rm""\n```\n\n### platforms\nUse `platforms` when you would like to build for specific target architectures.  \nArchitectures are separated by comma.  \n\n`docker/setup-buildx-action` must be executed before a step that contains `platforms`.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Set up Docker Buildx\n  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64\n```\n\n### cache\nUse `cache` when you have big images, that you would only like to build partially (changed layers).  \n> CAUTION: Docker builds will cache non-repoducable commands, such as installing packages. If you use this option, your packages will never update. To avoid this, run this action on a schedule with caching **disabled** to rebuild the cache periodically.\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish to Registry\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \'0 2 * * 0\' # Weekly on Sundays at 02:00\njobs:\n  update:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Publish to Registry\n      uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n      with:\n        name: myDocker/repository\n        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n        cache: ${{ github.event_name != \'schedule\' }}\n```\n\n### no_push\nUse `no_push` when you want to build an image, but not push it to a registry.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  no_push: ${{ github.event_name == \'push\' }}\n```\n\n### Tags\n\nThis action supports multiple options that tags are handled.  \nBy default a tag is pushed as `latest`.  \nFurthermore, one of the following options can be used. \n\n#### tags\nUse `tags` when you want to bring your own tags (separated by comma).  \n\n```yaml\n- name: Publish to Registry\n  uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n  with:\n    name: myDocker/repository\n    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n    tags: ""latest,another""\n```\n\nWhen using dynamic tag names the environment variable must be set via echo, as variables set in the environment will not auto resolve by convention.  \nThis example illustrates how you would push to latest along with creating a custom version tag in a release. Setting it to only run on published events will keep your tags from being filled with commit hashes and will only publish when a GitHub release is created, so if the GitHub release is 2.14 this will publish to the latest and 2.14 tags.\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish to Registry\non:    \n  release:\n      types: [published]\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \'0 2 * * 0\' # Weekly on Sundays at 02:00\njobs:\n  update:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - id: pre-step\n      shell: bash\n      run: echo ""release-version=$(echo ${GITHUB_REF:10})"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n    - name: Publish to Registry\n      uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@v5\n      with:\n        name: myDocker/repository\n        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n        tags: ""latest,${{ steps.pre-step.outputs.release-version }}""\n```\n\n#### tag_names\nUse `tag_names` when you want to push tags/release by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/MY_TAG_NAME`).  \n> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  tag_names: true\n```\n\n#### tag_semver\nUse `tag_semver` when you want to push tags using the semver syntax by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/v1.2.3`). This will push four\ndocker tags: `1.2.3`, `1.2` and `1`. A prefix \'v\' will automatically be removed.\n> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be override by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  name: myDocker/repository\n  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}\n  tag_semver: true\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

You can configure which by using the `method` parameter.\n\n### JWT with GitHub OIDC Tokens\n\nYou can configure trust between a GitHub Actions workflow\nand Vault using the\n[GitHub\'s OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).\nEach GitHub Actions workflow receives an auto-generated OIDC token with claims\nto establish the identity of the workflow.\n\n__Vault Configuration__\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to toggle instructions for configuring Vault.</summary>\n\nSet up Vault with the [JWT auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#configure).\nPass the following parameters to your auth method configuration:\n\n- `oidc_discovery_url`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`\n- `bound_issuer`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`\n\n\nConfigure a [Vault role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#create-role) for the auth method.\n\n- `role_type`: `jwt`\n\n- `bound_audiences`: `""https://github.com/<org>""`. Update this parameter if\n  you change the `aud` claim in the GitHub OIDC token via the\n  `jwtGithubAudience` parameter in the action config.\n\n- `user_claim`: Set this to a claim name (e.g., `repository`) in the\n  [GitHub OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token).\n\n- `bound_claims` OR `bound_subject`: match on [GitHub subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims).\n\n  - For wildcard (non-exact) matches, use `bound_claims`.\n\n     - `bound_claims_type`: `glob`\n\n     - `bound_claims`: JSON object. Maps one or more claim names to corresponding wildcard values.\n       ```json\n       {""sub"": ""repo:<orgName>/*""}\n       ```\n\n  - For exact matches, use `bound_subject`.\n\n    - `bound_claims_type`: `string`\n\n    - `bound_subject`: Must exactly match the `sub` claim in the OIDC token.\n      ```plaintext\n      repo:<orgName/repoName>:ref:refs/heads/branchName\n      ```\n\n</details>\n\n__GitHub Actions Workflow__\n\nIn the GitHub Actions workflow, the workflow needs permissions to read contents\nand write the ID token.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n    retrieve-secret:\n        permissions:\n            contents: read\n            id-token: write\n```\n\nIn the action, provide the name of the Vault role you created to the `role` parameter.\nYou can optionally set the `jwtGithubAudience` parameter to change the `aud`\nclaim from its default.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  role: <Vault JWT Auth Role Name>\n  method: jwt\n  jwtGithubAudience: sigstore # set the GitHub token\'s aud claim\n```\n\n### AppRole\n\nThe [AppRole auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle) allows\nyour GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a pre-defined role.\nSet the role ID and secret ID as GitHub secrets and pass them to the\n`roleId` and `secretId` parameters.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: approle\n  roleId: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ROLE_ID }}\n  secretId: ${{ secrets.VAULT_SECRET_ID }}\n```\n\n### Token\n\nFor the default method of authenticating to Vault,\nuse a [Vault token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens).\nSet the Vault token as a GitHub secret and pass\nit to the `token` parameter.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### GitHub\n\nThe [GitHub auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/github)\nrequires `read:org` permissions for authentication. The auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN`\ncreated for projects does not have these permissions and GitHub does not allow this\ntoken\'s permissions to be modified. A new GitHub Token secret must be created with\n`read:org` permissions to use this authentication method.\n\nPass the GitHub token as a GitHub secret into the `githubToken` parameter.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: github\n  githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### JWT with OIDC Provider\n\nYou can configure trust between your own OIDC Provider and Vault\nwith the JWT auth method. Provide a `role` & `jwtPrivateKey` parameters,\nadditionally you can pass `jwtKeyPassword` & `jwtTtl` parameters\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: jwt\n  role: <Vault JWT Auth Role Name>\n  jwtPrivateKey: ${{ secrets.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n  jwtKeyPassword: ${{ secrets.JWT_KEY_PASS }}\n  jwtTtl: 3600 # 1 hour, default value\n```\n\n### Kubernetes\n\nConsider the [Kubernetes auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes)\nwhen using self-hosted runners on Kubernetes. You must provide the `role` parameter\nfor the Vault role associated with the Kubernetes auth method.\nYou can optionally override the `kubernetesTokenPath` parameter for\ncustom-mounted serviceAccounts.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: kubernetes\n  role: <Vault Kubernetes Auth Role Name>\n  kubernetesTokenPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token # default token path\n```\n\n### Userpass\n\nThe [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass) allows\nyour GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password.\nSet the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the\n`username` and `password` parameters.\n\nThis is not the same as ldap or okta auth methods.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: userpass\n  username: ${{ secrets.VAULT_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\n### Ldap\n\nThe [LDAP auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/ldap) allows\nyour GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password inturn verfied with ldap servers.\nSet the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the\n`username` and `password` parameters.\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200\n  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n  method: ldap\n  username: ${{ secrets.VAULT_USERNAME }}\n  password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASSWORD }}\n```\n\n### Other Auth Methods\n\nIf any other method is specified and you provide an `authPayload`, the action will\nattempt to `POST` to `auth/${method}/login` with the provided payload and parse out the client token.\n\n## Key Syntax\n\nThe `secrets` parameter is a set of multiple secret requests separated by the `;` character.\n\nEach secret request consists of the `path` and the `key` of the desired secret, and optionally the desired Env Var output name. \nNote that the selector is using [JSONata](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html) and certain characters in keys may need to be escaped.\n\n```raw\n{{ Secret Path }} {{ Secret Key or Selector }} | {{ Env/Output Variable Name }}\n```\n\n### Simple Key\n\nTo retrieve a key `npmToken` from path `secret/data/ci` that has value `somelongtoken` from vault you could do:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n    secrets: secret/data/ci npmToken\n```\n\n`vault-action` will automatically normalize the given secret selector key, and set the follow as environment variables for the following steps in the current job:\n\n```bash\nNPMTOKEN=somelongtoken\n```\n\nYou can also access the secret via outputs:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n    # ...\n    - name: Import Secrets\n      id: secrets\n      # Import config...\n    - name: Sensitive Operation\n      run: ""my-cli --token \'${{ steps.secrets.outputs.npmToken }}\'""\n```\n\n_**Note:** If you\'d like to only use outputs and disable automatic environment variables, you can set the `exportEnv` option to `false`._\n\n### Set Output Variable Name\n\nHowever, if you want to set it to a specific name, say `NPM_TOKEN`, you could do this instead:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n    secrets: secret/data/ci npmToken | NPM_TOKEN\n```\n\nWith that, `vault-action` will now use your requested name and output:\n\n```bash\nNPM_TOKEN=somelongtoken\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  # ...\n  - name: Import Secrets\n    id: secrets\n    # Import config...\n  - name: Sensitive Operation\n    run: ""my-cli --token \'${{ steps.secrets.outputs.NPM_TOKEN }}\'""\n\n```\n\n### Multiple Secrets\n\nThis action can take multi-line input, so say you had your AWS keys stored in a path and wanted to retrieve both of them. You can do:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n    secrets: |\n        secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;\n        secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n```\n\n## Other Secret Engines\n\nVault Action currently supports retrieving secrets from any engine where secrets\nare retrieved via `GET` requests.  This means secret engines such as PKI are currently\nnot supported due to their requirement of sending parameters along with the request\n(such as `common_name`).\n\nFor example, to request a secret from the `cubbyhole` secret engine:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n    secrets: |\n        /cubbyhole/foo foo ;\n        /cubbyhole/foo zip | MY_KEY ;\n```\n\nResulting in:\n\n```bash\nFOO=bar\nMY_KEY=zap\n```\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  # ...\n  - name: Import Secrets\n    id: secrets\n    # Import config...\n  - name: Sensitive Operation\n    run: ""my-cli --token \'${{ steps.secrets.outputs.foo }}\'""\n  - name: Another Sensitive Operation\n    run: ""my-cli --token \'${{ steps.secrets.outputs.MY_KEY }}\'""\n```\n\n## Adding Extra Headers\n\nIf you ever need to add extra headers to the vault request, say if you need to authenticate with a firewall, all you need to do is set `extraHeaders`:\n\n```yaml\nwith:\n    secrets: |\n        secret/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;\n        secret/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n    extraHeaders: |\n      X-Secure-Id: ${{ secrets.SECURE_ID }}\n      X-Secure-Secret: ${{ secrets.SECURE_SECRET }}\n```\n\nThis will automatically add the `x-secure-id` and `x-secure-secret` headers to every request to Vault.\n\n## HashiCorp Cloud Platform or Vault Enterprise\n\nIf you are using [HCP Vault](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/vault)\nor Vault Enterprise, you may need additional parameters in\nyour GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n### Namespace\n\nIf you need to retrieve secrets from a specific Vault namespace, set the `namespace`\nparameter specifying the namespace. In HCP Vault, the namespace defaults to `admin`.\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n    # ...\n    - name: Import Secrets\n      uses: hashicorp/vault-action\n      with:\n        url: https://vault-enterprise.mycompany.com:8200\n        caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}\n        method: token\n        token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}\n        namespace: admin\n        secrets: |\n            secret/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;\n            secret/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;\n            secret/ci npm_token\n```\n\n## Reference\n\nHere are all the inputs available through `with`:\n\n| Input               | Description                                                                                                                                          | Default | Required |\n| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |\n| `url`               | The URL for the vault endpoint                                                                                                                       |         | \xe2\x9c\x94        |\n| `secrets`           | A semicolon-separated list of secrets to retrieve.

If you\'re concerned about the result, it\'s recommended to provide an explicit Output Var Key.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you wish to contribute to this project, the following dependencies are recommended for local development:\n- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install dependencies, build project and run tests\n- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the pre-configured vault containers for acceptance tests\n- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to spin up the pre-configured vault containers for acceptance tests\n- [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the vault-action locally\n\n### Build\n\nUse npm to install dependencies and build the project:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install && npm run build\n```\n\n### Vault test instance\n\nThe Github Action needs access to a working Vault instance to function. \nMultiple docker configurations are available via the docker-compose.yml file to run containers compatible with the various acceptance test suites.\n\n```sh\n$ docker-compose up -d vault # Choose one of: vault, vault-enterprise, vault-tls depending on which tests you would like to run\n```\n\nInstead of using one of the dockerized instance, you can also use your own local or remote Vault instance by exporting these environment variables:\n\n```sh\n$ export VAULT_HOST=<YOUR VAULT CLUSTER LOCATION> # localhost if undefined\n$ export VAULT_PORT=<YOUR VAULT PORT> # 8200 if undefined\n$ export VAULT_TOKEN=<YOUR VAULT TOKEN> # testtoken if undefined\n```\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nUnit tests can be executed at any time with no dependencies or prior setup.\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Running acceptance tests\n\nWith a succesful build to take your local changes into account and a working Vault instance configured, you can now run acceptance tests to validate if any regressions were introduced.\n\n```sh\n$ npm run test:integration:basic # Choose one of: basic, enterprise, e2e, e2e-tls\n```\n\n### Running the action locally\n\nYou can use the [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) command to test your\nchanges locally.\n\nEdit the ./.github/workflows/local-test.yaml file and add any steps necessary\nto test your changes. You may have to additionally edit the Vault url, token\nand secret path if you are not using one of the provided containerized\ninstances. The `local-test` job will call the ./integrationTests/e2e/setup.js\nscript to bootstrap your local Vault instance with secrets.\n\nRun your feature branch locally:\n\n```sh\nact workflow_dispatch -j local-test\n```\n\nOr use the provided make target which will also spin up a Vault container:\n\n```sh\nmake local-test\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

action installs SSH key in `~/.ssh`.\n\nUseful for SCP, SFTP, and `rsync` over SSH in deployment script.\n\ntested on:\n\n* [all available virtual machines](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) (Windows Server 2022/2019, macOS Monterey/Big Sur/Catalina, and Ubuntu 22.04/20.04/18.04)\n* [Docker container (Ubuntu)](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) / requires `openssh-client` package; `apt install -y openssh-client`\n* [Docker container (CentOS)](https://quay.io/repository/centos/centos) / requires `openssh-clients` package; `yum install -y openssh-clients`\n* [Docker container (Alpine Linux)](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) / requires `openssh-client` package; `apk add openssh-client`\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd your SSH key to your product secrets by clicking `Settings` - `Secrets` - `Add a new secret` beforehand.\n\nPEM(RSA), PKCS8, and RFC4716(OpenSSH) formats are OK.\n\n```yaml\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- name: Install SSH key\n  uses: shimataro/ssh-key-action@v2\n  with:\n    key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}\n    name: id_rsa # optional\n    known_hosts: ${{ secrets.KNOWN_HOSTS }}\n    config: ${{ secrets.CONFIG }} # ssh_config; optional\n    if_key_exists: fail # replace / ignore / fail; optional (defaults to fail)\n- name: rsync over SSH\n  run: rsync -r ./foo/ user@remote:bar/\n```\n\nSee [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for details.\n\n**NOTE:**\n\n* Server key of `github.com` will be always set to `known_hosts`.\n* SSH keys will be removed at the end of workflow.\n\n### Install multiple keys\n\nIf you want to install multiple keys, call this action multiple times.\nIt is useful for port forwarding.\n\n**NOTE:** When this action is called multiple times, **the contents of `known_hosts` and `config` will be appended**. `key` must be saved as different name, by using `name` option.\n\n```yaml\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n-

failed even though key has been installed.\n\nCheck below:\n\n* `Host key verification failed.`:\n    * Set `known_hosts` parameter correctly (use `ssh-keyscan` command).\n\n### I want to replace/ignore key if exists.\n\nUse `if_key_exists` parameter.\n\n* `replace`: replaces key\n* `ignore`: does nothing\n* `fail`: fails (default)\n\n### How do I use encrypted SSH key?\n\nThis action doesn\'t support encrypted key directly.\nHere are some solutions:\n\n* decrypting key beforehand: best bet, and works on any VM\n* `sshpass` command: next best bet, but not supported on Windows\n* `expect` command: be careful not to expose passphrase to console\n* `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable: might be troublesome\n\n### Which one is the best way for transferring files, ""direct SCP/SFTP/rsync"" or ""SCP/SFTP/rsync via bastion""?\n\nI recommend **rsync via bastion**.\n\n```bash\nrsync -r -e ""ssh bastion ssh"" ./foo/ target:bar/\n```\n\nIt has some advantages over other methods:\n\n* ""Rsync via bastion"" doesn\'t require to update workflow files and `secrets` even if it is necessary to transfer files to multiple servers.\n    * Other methods require to update `known_hosts` if servers have changed.\n* Rsync:\n    * is fastest of all.\n    * does **NOT** break files even if disconnected during transferring.\n    * can remove files that don\'t exist on server.\n* SCP is [deprecated by OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.0) due to outdated and inflexible protocol.\n* Using bastion is more secure because:\n    * it is not necessarily to expose SSH port on servers to public.\n        * Address filtering is less effective.\n        * Because Azure address range is [very wide](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses-of-github-hosted-runners).\n        * And will be updated continuously.\n    * if security incident \xe2\x80\x95e.g., private key leaked\xe2\x80\x95 occurs, it\'s OK just to remove `authorized_keys` on bastion.\n\n### I want to omit `known_hosts`.\n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that it is NOT secure to SSH with no `known_hosts` and using `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option.\n\nWhy do you want to omit it?\nIf the reason is **""I\'m not understanding about the function of `known_hosts`""** or **""It\'s bother to fetch server key""**, you should not omit.\nIf **""It is hard to prefetch server key because the server will be created dynamically""**, you can use bastion server.\n\n**""`known_hosts` is unnecessary because I\'m using secure method for SSH, such as SSHFP and signed server key.""** \xe2\x80\x94 OK, here is a special value to omit `known_hosts`.\nYou should use it ONLY IF you are using secure methods...\nIt is `known_hosts: unnecessary`.\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are

A workaround is to add the workflow containing this actions as a required status check. This way the pull request will become unmergable while the action is running, allowing auto-merge to be enabled.\n\n28735\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The `workflow` scope may also be required if rebasing pull requests containing changes to workflows under `.github/workflows`. | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |\n| `repository` | The target GitHub repository containing the pull request. | `github.repository` (Current repository) |\n| `head` | Filter pull requests by head user or head organization and branch name in the format `user:ref-name` or `organization:ref-name`. Use the `*` wildcard match any ref. e.g. `my-org:new-script-format` or `octocat:*`. | |\n| `base` | Filter pull requests by base branch name. Example: `gh-pages`. | |\n| `include-labels` | A comma or newline separated list of pull request labels to include. Allows any labels if unspecified. | |\n| `exclude-labels` | A comma or newline separated list of pull request labels to exclude. | |\n| `exclude-drafts` | Exclude draft pull requests. | `false` |\n\n### Rebase slash command\n\nUse the following two workflows and a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to add a `/rebase` slash command to pull request comments.\nThe [slash-command-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) action makes sure that the command is only executable by users with `write` access to the repository.\n\n```yml\nname: Slash Command Dispatch\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\njobs:\n  slashCommandDispatch:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Slash Command Dispatch\n        uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v3\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          commands: rebase\n          permission: write\n          issue-type: pull-request\n```\n\n```yml\nname: rebase-command\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [rebase-command]\njobs:\n  rebase:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: peter-evans/rebase@v2\n        id: rebase\n        with:\n          head: ${{ github.event.client_payload.pull_request.head.label }}\n      - name: Add reaction\n        if: steps.rebase.outputs.rebased-count == 1\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v1\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.repository.full_name }}\n          comment-id: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.comment.id }}\n          reaction-type: hooray\n```\n\n### Target other repositories\n\nYou can rebase requests in another repository by using a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\nThe user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository.\n\nThis example targets multiple repositories.\n\n```yml\nname: Rebase\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron:  '0 0 * * *'\njobs:\n  rebase:\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        repo: ['my-org/repo1', 'my-org/repo2', 'my-org/repo3']\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: peter-evans/rebase@v2\n        with:\n          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}\n          repository: ${{ matrix.repo }}\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

(`+1`, `-1`, `laugh`, `confused`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`, `eyes`) | |\n| `reactions-edit-mode` | The mode when updating comment reactions, `replace` or `append`. | `append` |\n\nNote: In *public* repositories this action does not work in `pull_request` workflows when triggered by forks.\nAny attempt will be met with the error, `Resource not accessible by integration`.\nThis is due to token restrictions put in place by GitHub Actions. Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-forks-of-private-repositories) from forks to run without restriction. See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#restrictions-on-repository-forks) for further explanation. Alternatively, use the [`pull_request_target`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target) event to comment on pull requests.\n\n#### Outputs\n\nThe ID of the created comment will be output for use in later steps.\nNote that in order to read the step output the action step must have an id.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Create comment\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v3\n        id: couc\n        with:\n          issue-number: 1\n          body: |\n            My comment\n      - name: Check outputs\n        run: |\n          echo ""Comment ID - ${{ steps.couc.outputs.comment-id }}""\n```\n\n### Where to find the id of a comment\n\nHow to find the id of a comment will depend a lot on the use case.\nHere is one example where the id can be found in the `github` context during an `issue_comment` event.\n\n```yml\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\njobs:\n  commentCreated:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Add reaction\n        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v3\n        with:\n          comment-id: ${{ github.event.comment.id }}\n          reactions: eyes\n```\n\nSome use cases might find the [find-comment](https://github.com/peter-evans/find-comment) action useful.\nThis will search an issue or pull request for the first comment containing a specified string, and/or by a specified author.\nSee the repository for detailed usage.\n\nIn the following example, find-comment is used to determine if a comment has already been created on a pull request.\nIf the find-comment action output `comment-id` returns an empty string, a new comment will be created.\nIf it returns a value, the comment already exists and the content is replaced.\n```yml\n    - name: Find Comment\n      uses: peter-evans/find-comment@v2\n      id: fc\n      with:\n        issue-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n        comment-author: \'github-actions[bot]\'\n        body-includes: Build output\n\n    -

name: Render template\n        id: template\n        uses: chuhlomin/render-template@v1.4\n        with:\n          template: .github/comment-template.md\n          vars: |\n            foo: this\n            bar: that\n\n      -

139,"b""# Automatic Pull Request Review\n\n> \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d Github action to automate pull requests\n\nThis action allows you to use any of the `pull_request` [webhook event](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#webhook-events) to automate pull request reviews. For example when a `pull request` is `opened` by `dependabot`, automatically approve it.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/pull-request-automation.yml` to your project.\n2. In the `pull-request-automation.yml` you have to decide which events you'll act on and the actors pull requests to automate.\n\n_For example:_\n\nTo approve all pull requests pull requests from `dependabot`, you would add the following to the `yml` file:\n\n```yml\nname: Automatic pull request review\non: [pull_request]\njobs:\n  automate-pullrequest-review:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Approve pull request\n        if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'\n        uses: andrewmusgrave/automatic-pull-request-review@0.0.5\n        with:\n          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          event: APPROVE\n          body: 'Thank you dependabot \xf0\x9f\x8e\x8a'\n```\n\n## Workflow options\n\nThese are the options recommended to be changed. For more detailed explanation of the workflow file, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).\n\n| Setting      | Description                                                                                | Values                                           |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `event`      | The event to perform on the pull request review.                                           | APPROVE \\| COMMENT \\| DISMISS \\| REQUEST_CHANGES |\n| `body`       | The contents of the review body comment.

However, you can set different actions using the ""with"" options. If you don\'t want to upload your sources to Crowdin, just set the `upload_sources` option to false.\n\nBy default, sources and translations are being uploaded to the root of your Crowdin project. Still, if you use branches, you can set the preferred source branch.\n\nYou can also specify what GitHub branch you\xe2\x80\x99d like to download your translations to (default translation branch is `l10n_crowdin_action`).\n\nIn case you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to download translations from Crowdin (`download_translations: false`), `localization_branch_name` and `create_pull_request` options aren\'t required either.\n\n```yaml\n- name: crowdin action\n  uses: crowdin/github-action@v1\n  with:\n    # Upload sources option\n    upload_sources: true\n    # This can be used to pass down any supported argument of the `upload sources` cli command, e.g.\n    upload_sources_args: \'--no-auto-update label=web\'\n\n    # Upload translations options\n    upload_translations: true\n    upload_language: \'uk\'\n    auto_approve_imported: true\n    import_eq_suggestions: true\n    # This can be used to pass down any supported argument of the `upload translations` cli command, e.g.\n    upload_translations_args: \'--auto-approve-imported --translate-hidden\'\n\n    # Download sources options\n    download_sources: true\n    push_sources: true\n    # this can be used to pass down any supported argument of the `download sources` cli command, e.g.\n    download_sources_args: \'--reviewed\'\n\n    # Download translations options\n    download_translations: true\n    download_language: \'uk\'\n    skip_untranslated_strings: true\n    skip_untranslated_files: true\n    export_only_approved: true\n    push_translations: true\n    commit_message: \'New Crowdin translations by GitHub Action\'\n    # this can be used to pass down any supported argument of the `download translations` cli command, e.g.\n    download_translations_args: \'--all --skip-untranslated-strings\'\n\n    # This is the name of the git branch that Crowdin will create when opening a pull request.\n    # This branch does NOT need to be manually created.

For example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: crowdin action\n  uses: crowdin/github-action@v1\n  with:\n    command: \'pre-translate\'\n    command_args: \'-l uk --method tm --branch main\'\n```\n\nTo see the full list of available commands, visit the [official documentation](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/).\n\n### Crowdin configuration file\n\nIf your workflow file specifies the `config` property, you\'ll need to add the following to your [Crowdin configuration file](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/) (e.g. `crowdin.yml`):\n\n```yml\nproject_id_env: CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID\napi_token_env: CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN\n```\n\nWhen the workflow runs, the real values of your token and project ID will be injected into the config using the secrets in the environment.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute please read the [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.\n\n## Seeking Assistance\n\nIf you find any problems or would like to suggest a feature, please feel free to file an issue on GitHub at [Issues Page](https://github.com/crowdin/github-action/issues).\n\n## License\n\n<pre>\nThe Crowdin GitHub Action is licensed under the MIT License.\nSee the LICENSE file distributed with this work for additional\ninformation regarding copyright ownership.\n\nExcept as contained in the LICENSE file, the name(s) of the above copyright\nholders shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale,\nuse or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization.\n</pre>\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

147,"b""# setup-ruby\n\nThis action downloads a prebuilt ruby and adds it to the `PATH`.\n\nIt is very efficient and takes about 5 seconds to download, extract and add the given Ruby to the `PATH`.\nNo extra packages need to be installed.\n\nCompared to [actions/setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby),\nthis actions supports many more versions and features.\n\n### Supported Versions\n\nThis action currently supports these versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby:\n\n| Interpreter | Versions |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Ruby | 2.1.9, 2.2, 2.3.0 - 2.3.8, 2.4.0 - 2.4.10, 2.5.0 - 2.5.8, 2.6.0 - 2.6.6, 2.7.1, head, debug, mingw, mswin |\n| JRuby | 9.1.17.0, 9.2.9.0 - 9.2.13.0, head |\n| TruffleRuby | 19.3.0 - 20.2.0, head |\n| Rubinius | 4.14 |\n\n`ruby-debug` is the same as `ruby-head` but with assertions enabled (`-DRUBY_DEBUG=1`).  \nOn Windows, `mingw` and `mswin` are `ruby-head` builds using the MSYS2/MinGW and the MSVC toolchains respectively.\n\nRuby 2.2 resolves to 2.2.6 on Windows (last build from RubyInstaller) and 2.2.10 otherwise.  \nRuby 2.3 on Windows only has builds for 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 (same as RubyInstaller).\n\nNote that Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.3 and the OpenSSL version it needs (1.0.2) are both end-of-life,\nwhich means Ruby \xe2\x89\xa4 2.3 is unmaintained and considered insecure.\nOn Windows, Ruby 2.4 uses OpenSSL 1.0.2, which is no longer maintained.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe action works for all [GitHub-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners), and [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners), under [certain conditions](#limitations)\n\n| Operating System | Recommended | Other Supported Versions |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Ubuntu  | `ubuntu-latest`  (= `ubuntu-18.04`) | `ubuntu-20.04`, `ubuntu-16.04` |\n| macOS   | `macos-latest`   (= `macos-10.15`)  | |\n| Windows | `windows-latest` (= `windows-2019`) | `windows-2016` |\n\nRubinius is only available on `ubuntu-18.04`.\n\nThe prebuilt releases are generated by [ruby-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder)\nand on Windows by [RubyInstaller2](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2).\n`mingw` and `mswin` builds are generated by [ruby-loco](https://github.com/MSP-Greg/ruby-loco).\n`ruby-head` is generated by [ruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/ruby-dev-builder),\n`jruby-head` is generated by [jruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/jruby-dev-builder)\nand `truffleruby-head` is generated by [truffleruby-dev-builder](https://github.com/ruby/truffleruby-dev-builder).\nThe full list of available Ruby versions can be seen in [ruby-builder-versions.js](ruby-builder-versions.js)\nfor Ubuntu and macOS and in [windows-versions.js](windows-versions.js) for Windows.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Single Job\n\n```yaml\nname: My workflow\non: [push]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        ruby-version: 2.6 # Not needed with a .ruby-version file\n    - run: bundle install\n    - run: bundle exec rake\n```\n\n### Matrix\n\nThis matrix tests all stable releases and `head` versions of MRI, JRuby and TruffleRuby on Ubuntu and macOS.\n\n```yaml\nname: My workflow\non: [push]\njobs:\n  test:\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [ubuntu, macos]\n        ruby: [2.5, 2.6, 2.7, head, debug, jruby, jruby-head, truffleruby, truffleruby-head]\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest\n    continue-on-error: ${{ endsWith(matrix.ruby, 'head') || matrix.ruby == 'debug' }}\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        ruby-version: ${{ matrix.ruby }}\n    - run: bundle install\n    - run: bundle exec rake\n```\n\nSee the GitHub Actions documentation for more details about the\n[workflow syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)\nand the [condition and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).\n\n### Supported Version Syntax\n\n* engine-version like `ruby-2.6.5` and `truffleruby-19.3.0`\n* short version like `2.6`, automatically using the latest release matching that version (`2.6.5`)\n* version only like `2.6.5`, assumes MRI for the engine\n* engine only like `truffleruby`, uses the latest stable release of that implementation\n* `.ruby-version` reads from the project's `.ruby-version` file\n* `.tool-versions` reads from the project's `.tool-versions` file\n* If the `ruby-version` input is not specified, `.ruby-version` is tried first, followed by `.tool-versions`\n\n### Working Directory\n\nThe `working-directory` input can be set to resolve `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions` and `Gemfile.lock`\nif they are not at the root of the repository, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.\n\n### Bundler\n\nBy default, if there is a `Gemfile.lock` file (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock` if `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE` is set) with a `BUNDLED WITH` section,\nthe latest version of Bundler with the same major version will be installed.\nOtherwise, the latest compatible Bundler version is installed (Bundler 2 on Ruby >= 2.4, Bundler 1 on Ruby < 2.4).\n\nThis behavior can be customized, see [action.yml](action.yml) for details about the `bundler` input.\n\n### Caching `bundle install` automatically\n\nThis action provides a way to automatically run `bundle install` and cache the result:\n```yaml\n    - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1\n      with:\n        bundler-cache: true\n```\n\nThis caching speeds up installing gems significantly and avoids too many requests to RubyGems.org.  \nIt needs a `Gemfile` (or `$BUNDLE_GEMFILE`) under the [`working-directory`](#working-directory).  \nThe caching works whether there is a `Gemfile.lock` or not.\nIf there is a `Gemfile.lock`, `bundle config --local deployment true` is used.\n\nTo perform caching, this action will use `bundle config --local path vendor/bundle`.  \nTherefore, the Bundler `path` should not be changed in your workflow for the cache to work.\n\n### Caching `bundle install` manually\n\nYou can also cache gems manually,\nbut this is not recommended because it is verbose and very difficult to use a correct cache key.\nYou can cache the installed gems with these two steps:\n\n```yaml\n    - uses: actions/cache@v2\n      with:\n        path: vendor/bundle\n        key: bundle-use-ruby-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.ruby }}-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}\n        restore-keys: |\n          bundle-use-ruby-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.ruby }}-\n    - name: bundle install\n      run: |\n        bundle config deployment true\n        bundle config path vendor/bundle\n        bundle install --jobs 4\n```\n\nWhen using a single OS, replace `${{ matrix.os }}` with the OS.  \nWhen using a single job with a Ruby version, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with the Ruby version.  \nWhen using `.ruby-version`, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with `${{ hashFiles('.ruby-version') }}`.  \nWhen using `.tool-versions`, replace `${{ matrix.ruby }}` with `${{ hashFiles('.tool-versions') }}`.\n\nThis uses the [cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache).\nThe code above is a more complete version of the [Ruby - Bundler example](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#ruby---bundler).\nMake sure to include `use-ruby` in the `key` to avoid conflicting with previous caches.\n\n## Windows\n\nNote that running CI on Windows can be quite challenging if you are not very familiar with Windows.\nIt is recommended to first get your build working on Ubuntu and macOS before trying Windows.\n\n* The default shell on Windows is not Bash but [PowerShell](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell).\n  This can lead issues such as multi-line scripts [not working as expected](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/13).\n* The `PATH` contains [multiple compiler toolchains](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/19). Use `where.exe` to debug which tool is used.\n* For Ruby \xe2\x89\xa5 2.4, MSYS2 is prepended to the `Path`, similar to what RubyInstaller2 does.\n* For Ruby < 2.4, the DevKit MSYS tools are installed and prepended to the `Path`.\n* JRuby on Windows has a known bug that `bundle exec rake` [fails](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/18).\n\n## Versioning\n\nIt is highly recommended to use `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` for the version of this action.\nThis will provide the best experience by automatically getting bug fixes, new Ruby versions and new features.\n\nIf you instead choose a specific version (v1.2.3) or a commit sha, there will be no automatic bug fixes and\nit will be your responsibility to update every time the action no longer works.\nMake sure to always use the latest release before reporting an issue on GitHub.\n\nThis action follows semantic versioning with a moving `v1` branch.\nThis follows the [recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) of GitHub Actions.\n\n## Using self-hosted runners\nYou must meet the following parameters to use this action with self-hosted runners:\n\n* Make sure that the operating system has `libyaml-0` installed\n* The runner software is running as user `runner` with a home directory of `/home/runner`, or you have created a symlink for the home directory of whatever user that the runner is running as to `/home/runner`.\n\n## History\n\nThis action used to be at `eregon/use-ruby-action` and was moved to the `ruby` organization.\nPlease [update](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/releases/tag/v1.13.0) if you are using `eregon/use-ruby-action`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe current maintainer of this action is @eregon.\nMost of the Windows logic is based on work by MSP-Greg.\nMany thanks to MSP-Greg and Lars Kanis for the help with Ruby Installer.\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
148,"b'## Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions\nConfigure your AWS credentials and region environment variables for use in other\nGitHub Actions. This action implements the AWS SDK credential resolution chain\nand exports environment variables for your other Actions to use. Environment\nvariable exports are detected by both the AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI for AWS API\ncalls.\n\n### Recent updates\n\n**GitHub OIDC Changes**\n\nIn #[357](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/357), we\nobserved that GitHub recently started offering one of several intermediate OIDC\nendpoint thumbprints. Because IAM requires statically configured endpoint\nthumbprints, AWS customers that had only one thumbprint configured could see\nintermittent authentication failures. **As of July 6, 2023, AWS has made a change to\nIAM that will no longer require any particular certificate thumbprint for\ntokens.actions.githubusercontent.com**, which is the GitHub OIDC endpoint. Instead,\nAWS secures communication with GitHub OIDC using our library of trusted CAs rather\nthan using a certificate thumbprint to verify the server certificate. The IAM APIs\nstill require that a thumbprint is configured, but those thumbprints will be ignored\nwhen authenticating tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com.\n\nGitHub Enterprise Server customers use a different endpoint so they are not affected by\nthis change.\n\n*Original message:*\nThere are now [two possible intermediary certificates](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-27-github-actions-update-on-oidc-integration-with-aws/) for the Actions SSL certificate. Previously, the certificate with the thumbprint `6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1` was guaranteed to return. Now, the certificate with the thumbprint `1c58a3a8518e8759bf075b76b750d4f2df264fcd` can also be returned, so you will need to [update your identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) with this additional new thumbprint.\n\n### Table of Contents\n<!-- toc -->\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Credentials](#credentials)\n- [Assuming a Role](#assuming-a-role)\n    + [Session tagging](#session-tagging)\n    + [Sample IAM Role Permissions](#sample-iam-role-cloudformation-template)\n- [Self-Hosted Runners](#self-hosted-runners)\n    + [Proxy Configuration](#proxy-configuration)\n- [License Summary](#license-summary)\n- [Security Disclosures](#security-disclosures)\n<!-- tocstop -->\n\n## Usage\nWe support four methods for fetching credentials from AWS, but we recommend that\nyou use GitHub\'s OIDC provider in conjunction with a configured AWS IAM\nIdentity Provider endpoint.\n\nTo do that, you would add the following step to your workflow:\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n```\nThis will cause the action to perform an `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` call and\nreturn temporary security credentials for use by other actions. In order for\nthis to work, you\'ll need to preconfigure the IAM IdP in your AWS account\n(see [Assuming a Role](#assuming-a-role) for details).\n\nYou can use this action with the AWS CLI available in\n[GitHub\'s hosted virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners) or run this action multiple times\nto use different AWS accounts, regions, or IAM roles in the same GitHub Actions\nworkflow. As an example, here is a complete workflow file that uploads artifacts\nto Amazon S3.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    name: Upload to Amazon S3\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # These permissions are needed to interact with GitHub\'s OIDC Token endpoint.\n    permissions:\n      id-token: write\n      contents: read\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Configure AWS credentials from Test account\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/my-github-actions-role-test\n        aws-region: us-east-1\n    - name: Copy files to the test website with the AWS CLI\n      run: |\n        aws s3 sync . s3://my-s3-test-website-bucket\n    - name: Configure AWS credentials from Production account\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/my-github-actions-role-prod\n        aws-region: us-west-2\n    - name: Copy files to the production website with the AWS CLI\n      run: |\n        aws s3 sync . s3://my-s3-prod-website-bucket\n```\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs\nand outputs.\n\n## Credentials\n\nWe recommend following\n[Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)\nfor the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:\n  * Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code.\n  * [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions\n  workflows. Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your\n  GitHub Actions workflows.\n  * [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n## Assuming a Role\nThere are four different supported ways to retrieve credentials. We recommend\nusing [GitHub\'s OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)\nto get short-lived credentials needed for your actions. Specifying\n`role-to-assume` **without** providing an `aws-access-key-id` or a\n`web-identity-token-file`, or setting `role-chaining`, will signal to the action that you wish to use the\nOIDC provider. If `role-chaining` is `true`, existing credentials in the environment will be used to assume `role-to-assume`.\n\nThe following table describes which identity is used based on which values are supplied to the Action:\n\n| **Identity Used**                                               | `aws-access-key-id` | `role-to-assume` | `web-identity-token-file` | `role-chaining` |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | - |\n| [\xe2\x9c\x85 Recommended] Assume Role directly using GitHub OIDC provider |                     | \xe2\x9c\x94                |                           | |\n| IAM User                                                        | \xe2\x9c\x94                   |                  |                           | |\n| Assume Role using IAM User credentials                          | \xe2\x9c\x94                   | \xe2\x9c\x94                |                           | |\n| Assume Role using WebIdentity Token File credentials            |                     | \xe2\x9c\x94                | \xe2\x9c\x94                         | |\n| Assume Role using existing credentials | | \xe2\x9c\x94 | | \xe2\x9c\x94 |\n\n### Credential Lifetime\nThe default session duration is **1 hour** when using the OIDC provider to\ndirectly assume an IAM Role or when an `aws-session-token` is directly provided.\nThe default session duration is **6 hours** when using an IAM User to assume an\nIAM Role (by providing an `aws-access-key-id`, `aws-secret-access-key`, and a\n`role-to-assume`) .\n\nIf you would like to adjust this you can pass a duration to `role-duration-seconds`, but the duration cannot exceed the maximum that was defined when the IAM Role was created.\nThe default session name is GitHubActions, and you can modify it by specifying the desired name in `role-session-name`.\nThe default audience is `sts.amazonaws.com` which you can replace by specifying the desired audience name in `audience`.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (recommended)\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n```\nIn this example, the Action will load the OIDC token from the GitHub-provided environment variable and use it to assume the role `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` with the session name `MySessionName`.\n\n#### AssumeRole with static IAM credentials in repository secrets\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n    - name: Configure other AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n        role-chaining: true\n```\nIn this two-step example, the first step will use OIDC to assume the role `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` just as in the prior example. Following that, a second step will use this role to assume a different role, `arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role`.\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}\n        role-external-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID }}\n        role-duration-seconds: 1200\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n```\nIn this example, the secret `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` contains a string like `arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role`.  To assume a role in the same account as the static credentials, you can simply specify the role name, like `role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role`.\n\n#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity using a custom audience\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials for Beta Customers\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        audience: beta-customers\n        aws-region: us-east-3\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n```\nIn this example, the audience has been changed from the default to use a different audience name `beta-customers`. This can help ensure that the role can only affect those AWS accounts whose GitHub OIDC providers have explicitly opted in to the `beta-customers` label.\n\nChanging the default audience may be necessary when using non-default [AWS partitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).\n\n#### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity and disable secure Action outputs\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n        mask-aws-account-id: false\n```\nIn this example, account ID masking has been disabled. By default, the AWS\naccount ID will be obscured in the action\'s output. This may be helpful when\ndebugging action failures.\n\n## Sample IAM OIDC CloudFormation Template\nIf you choose to use GitHub\'s OIDC provider, you must first set up federation\nwith the provider in as an IAM IdP. The GitHub OIDC provider only needs to be\ncreated once per account (i.e. multiple IAM Roles that can be assumed by the\nGitHub\'s OIDC can share a single OIDC Provider).\n\nNote that the thumbprint has been set to all F\'s because the thumbprint is not\nused when authenticating tokens.actions.githubusercontent.com. Instead, IAM\nuses its library of trusted CAs to authenticate. However, this value is still\nrequired by the API.\n\nThis CloudFormation template will configure the IdP for you. You can copy the\ntemplate below, or load it from here: \nhttps://d38mtn6aq9zhn6.cloudfront.net/configure-aws-credentials-latest.yml\n\n```yaml\nParameters:\n  GitHubOrg:\n    Description: Name of GitHub organization/user (case sensitive)\n    Type: String\n  RepositoryName:\n    Description: Name of GitHub repository (case sensitive)\n    Type: String\n  OIDCProviderArn:\n    Description: Arn for the GitHub OIDC Provider.\n    Default: """"\n    Type: String\n  OIDCAudience:\n    Description: Audience supplied to configure-aws-credentials.\n    Default: ""sts.amazonaws.com""\n    Type: String\n\nConditions:\n  CreateOIDCProvider: !Equals \n    - !Ref OIDCProviderArn\n    - """"\n\nResources:\n  Role:\n    Type: AWS::IAM::Role\n    Properties:\n      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:\n        Statement:\n          - Effect: Allow\n            Action: sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n            Principal:\n              Federated: !If \n                - CreateOIDCProvider\n                - !Ref GithubOidc\n                - !Ref OIDCProviderArn\n            Condition:\n              StringEquals:\n                token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud: !Ref OIDCAudience\n              StringLike:\n                token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub: !Sub repo:${GitHubOrg}/${RepositoryName}:*\n\n  GithubOidc:\n    Type: AWS::IAM::OIDCProvider\n    Condition: CreateOIDCProvider\n    Properties:\n      Url: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\n      ClientIdList: \n        - sts.amazonaws.com\n      ThumbprintList:\n        - ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n\nOutputs:\n  Role:\n    Value: !GetAtt Role.Arn \n```\n\nTo align with the Amazon IAM best practice of\n[granting least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege), the assume role policy document should contain a\n[`Condition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) that specifies a subject allowed to assume the role. Without a subject\ncondition, any GitHub user or repository could potentially assume the role. The\nsubject can be scoped to a GitHub organization and repository as shown in the\nCloudFormation template. Additional claim conditions can be added for higher\nspecificity as explained in the\n[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).\nDue to implementation details, not every OIDC claim is presently supported by\nIAM.\n\nFor further information on OIDC and GitHub Actions, please see:\n\n* [AWS docs: Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html)\n* [AWS docs: IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)\n* [GitHub docs: About security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)\n* [GitHub docs: Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)\n* [GitHub changelog: GitHub Actions: Secure cloud deployments with OpenID Connect](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-github-actions-secure-cloud-deployments-with-openid-connect/)\n\n### Session tagging\nThe session will have the name ""GitHubActions"" and be tagged with the following\ntags: (`GITHUB_` environment variable definitions can be\n[found here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables))\n\n| Key        | Value             |\n| ---------- | ----------------- |\n| GitHub     | ""Actions""         |\n| Repository | GITHUB_REPOSITORY |\n| Workflow   | GITHUB_WORKFLOW   |\n| Action     | GITHUB_ACTION     |\n| Actor      | GITHUB_ACTOR      |\n| Branch     | GITHUB_REF        |\n| Commit     | GITHUB_SHA        |\n\n_Note: all tag values must conform to\n[the requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html).\nParticularly, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` will be truncated if it\'s too long. If\n`GITHUB_ACTOR` or `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` contain invalid characters, the characters\nwill be replaced with an \'*\'._\n\nThe action will use session tagging by default during role assumption. \nNote that for WebIdentity role assumption, the session tags have to be included\nin the encoded WebIdentity token. This means that Tags can only be supplied by\nthe OIDC provider and not set during the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API call\nwithin the Action. You can skip this session tagging by providing\n`role-skip-session-tagging` as true in the action\'s inputs:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n        role-skip-session-tagging: true\n```\n\n### Inline session policy\nAn IAM policy in stringified JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.\nDepending on preferences, the JSON could be written on a single line like this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n         inline-session-policy: \'{""Version"":""2012-10-17"",""Statement"":[{""Sid"":""Stmt1"",""Effect"":""Allow"",""Action"":""s3:List*"",""Resource"":""*""}]}\'\n```\nOr we can have a nicely formatted JSON as well:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n         inline-session-policy: >-\n          {\n           ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n           ""Statement"": [\n            {\n             ""Sid"":""Stmt1"",\n             ""Effect"":""Allow"",\n             ""Action"":""s3:List*"",\n             ""Resource"":""*""\n            }\n           ]\n          }\n```\n\n### Managed session policies\nThe Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies.\nThe policies must exist in the same account as the role. You can pass a single managed policy like this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n         managed-session-policies: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\n```\nAnd we can pass multiple managed policies likes this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n      with:\n         managed-session-policies: |\n          arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\n          arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3OutpostsReadOnlyAccess\n```\n\n## Self-Hosted Runners\n\nIf you run your GitHub Actions in a\n[self-hosted runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) that already has access to AWS credentials, such as\nan EC2 instance, then you do not need to provide IAM user access key credentials\nto this action. We will use the standard AWS JavaScript SDK credential\nresolution methods to find your credentials, so if the AWS JS SDK can\nauthenticate on your runner, this Action will as well.\n\nIf no access key credentials are given in the action inputs, this action will\nuse credentials from the runner environment using the\n[default methods for the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).\n\nYou can use this action to simply configure the region and account ID in the\nenvironment, and then use the runner\'s credentials for all AWS API calls made by\nyour Actions workflow:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n```\nIn this case, your runner\'s credentials must have permissions to call any AWS\nAPIs called by your Actions workflow.\n\nOr, you can use this action to assume a role, and then use the role credentials\nfor all AWS API calls made by your Actions workflow:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role\n```\nIn this case, your runner\'s credentials must have permissions to assume the\nrole.\n\nYou can also assume a role using a web identity token file, such as if using\n[Amazon EKS IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html). Pods running in EKS\nworker nodes that do not run as root can use this file to assume a role with a\nweb identity.\n\n### Proxy Configuration\n\nIf you run in self-hosted environments and in secured environment where you need\nuse a specific proxy you can set it in the action manually.\n\nAdditionally this action will always consider already configured proxy in the\nenvironment.\n\nManually configured proxy:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role\n  http-proxy: ""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n```\n\nProxy configured in the environment variable:\n```bash\n# Your environment configuration\nHTTP_PROXY=""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n```\n\nThe action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment and\nyou don\'t need to configure it in the action.\n\n### Use with the AWS CLI\nThis workflow does _not_ install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\ninto your environment. Self-hosted runners that intend to run this action prior\nto executing `aws` commands need to have the AWS CLI\n[installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)\nif it\'s not already present. \nMost [GitHub hosted runner environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)\nshould include the AWS CLI by default.\n \n## License Summary\nThis code is made available under the MIT license.\n\n## Security Disclosures\nIf you would like to report a potential security issue in this project, please do not create a GitHub issue.

There you can connect either directly per SSH or via a web based terminal.\n\n![GitHub Checks tab](./docs/checks-tab.png ""GitHub Checks tab"")\n\n## Manually triggered debug\n\nInstead of having to add/remove, or uncomment the required config and push commits each time you want to run your workflow with debug, you can make the debug step conditional on an optional parameter that you provide through a [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) ""manual event"".\n\nAdd the following to the `on` events of your workflow:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      debug_enabled:\n        type: boolean\n        description: \'Run the build with tmate debugging enabled (https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate)\'\n        required: false\n        default: false\n```\n\nThen add an [`if`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) condition to the debug step:\n\n<!--\n{% raw %}\n-->\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      # Enable tmate debugging of manually-triggered workflows if the input option was provided\n      - name: Setup tmate session\n        uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n        if: ${{ github.event_name == \'workflow_dispatch\' && inputs.debug_enabled }}\n```\n<!--\n{% endraw %}\n-->\n\nYou can then [manually run a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) on the desired branch and set `debug_enabled` to true to get a debug session.\n\n## Detached mode\n\nBy default, this Action starts a `tmate` session and waits for the session to be done (typically by way of a user connecting and exiting the shell after debugging). In detached mode, this Action will start the `tmate` session, print the connection details, and continue with the next step(s) of the workflow\'s job. At the end of the job, the Action will wait for the session to exit.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      with:\n        detached: true\n```\n\nBy default, this mode will wait at the end of the job for a user to connect and then to terminate the tmate session. If no user has connected within 10 minutes after the post-job step started, it will terminate the `tmate` session and quit gracefully.\n\n## Without sudo\n\nBy default we run installation commands using sudo on Linux. If you get `sudo: not found` you can use the parameter below to execute the commands directly.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      with:\n        sudo: false\n```\n\n## Timeout\n\nBy default the tmate session will remain open until the workflow times out. You can [specify your own timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepstimeout-minutes) in minutes if you wish to reduce GitHub Actions usage.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      timeout-minutes: 15\n```\n\n## Only on failure\nBy default a failed step will cause all following steps to be skipped. You can specify that the tmate session only starts if a previous step [failed](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#failure).\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      if: ${{ failure() }}\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n```\n\n## Use registered public SSH key(s)\n\nIf [you have registered one or more public SSH keys with your GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), tmate will be started such that only those keys are authorized to connect, otherwise anybody can connect to the tmate session. If you want to require a public SSH key to be installed with the tmate session, no matter whether the user who started the workflow has registered any in their GitHub profile, you will need to configure the setting `limit-access-to-actor` to `true`, like so:\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      with:\n        limit-access-to-actor: true\n```\n\nIf the registered public SSH key is not your default private SSH key, you will need to specify the path manually, like so: `ssh -i <path-to-key> <tmate-connection-string>`.\n\n## Use your own tmate servers\n\nBy default the tmate session uses `ssh.tmate.io`. You can use your own tmate servers. [tmate-ssh-server](https://github.com/tmate-io/tmate-ssh-server) is the server side part of tmate.\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Setup tmate session\n      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      with:\n        tmate-server-host: ssh.tmate.io\n        tmate-server-port: 22\n        tmate-server-rsa-fingerprint: SHA256:Hthk2T/M/Ivqfk1YYUn5ijC2Att3+UPzD7Rn72P5VWs\n        tmate-server-ed25519-fingerprint: SHA256:jfttvoypkHiQYUqUCwKeqd9d1fJj/ZiQlFOHVl6E9sI\n```\n\n## Skip installing tmate\n\nBy default, tmate and its dependencies are installed in a platform-dependent manner. When using self-hosted agents, this can become unnecessary or can even break. You can skip installing tmate and its dependencies using `install-dependencies`:\n\n```yaml\nname: CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]\n    steps:\n    - uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3\n      with:\n        install-dependencies: false\n```\n\n## Continue a workflow\n\nIf you want to continue a workflow and you are inside a tmate session, just create a empty file with the name `continue` either in the root directory or in the project directory by running `touch continue` or `sudo touch /continue`.\n\n## Connection string / URL is not visible\n\nThe connection string will be written in the logs every 5 seconds.

This includes multi-platform build, secrets, remote cache, etc.\nand different builder deployment/namespacing options.\n\n![Screenshot](.github/build-push-action.png)\n\n___\n\n* [Usage](#usage)\n  * [Git context](#git-context)\n  * [Path context](#path-context)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n  * [Multi-platform image](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/)\n  * [Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/secrets/)\n  * [Push to multi-registries](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/push-multi-registries/)\n  * [Manage tags and labels](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/manage-tags-labels/)\n  * [Cache management](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/cache/)\n  * [Export to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/export-docker/)\n  * [Test before push](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/test-before-push/)\n  * [Local registry](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/local-registry/)\n  * [Share built image between jobs](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/share-image-jobs/)\n  * [Named contexts](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/named-contexts/)\n  * [Copy image between registries](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/copy-image-registries/)\n  * [Update Docker Hub repo description](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/update-dockerhub-desc/)\n* [Customizing](#customizing)\n  * [inputs](#inputs)\n  * [outputs](#outputs)\n* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Usage\n\nIn the examples below we are also using 3 other actions:\n\n* [`setup-buildx`](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action) action will\n  create and boot a builder using by default the [`docker-container` driver](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/drivers/docker-container/).\n  This is **not required but recommended** using it to be able to build\n  multi-platform images, export cache, etc.\n* [`setup-qemu`](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action) action can be\n  useful if you want to add emulation support with QEMU to be able to build\n  against more platforms. \n* [`login`](https://github.com/docker/login-action) action will take care to\n  log in against a Docker registry.\n\n### Git context\n\nBy default, this action uses the [Git context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories),\nso you don\'t need to use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/)\naction to check out the repository as this will be done directly by [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).\n\nThe git reference will be based on the [event that triggered your workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)\nand will result in the following context: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git#<ref>`.\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - \'main\'\n\njobs:\n  docker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      -\n        name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n      -\n        name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2\n      -\n        name: Login to Docker Hub\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}\n      -\n        name: Build and push\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n        with:\n          push: true\n          tags: user/app:latest\n```\n\nBe careful because **any file mutation in the steps that precede the build step\nwill be ignored, including processing of the `.dockerignore` file** since\nthe context is based on the Git reference. However, you can use the\n[Path context](#path-context) using the [`context` input](#inputs) alongside\nthe [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/) action to remove\nthis restriction.\n\nDefault Git context can also be provided using the [Handlebars template](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/)\nexpression `{{defaultContext}}`. Here we can use it to provide a subdirectory\nto the default Git context:\n\n```yaml\n      -\n        # Setting up Docker Buildx with docker-container driver is required\n        # at the moment to be able to use a subdirectory with Git context\n        name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2\n      -\n        name: Build and push\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n        with:\n          context: ""{{defaultContext}}:mysubdir""\n          push: true\n          tags: user/app:latest\n```\n\n> **Warning**\n>\n> Subdirectory for Git context is available from [BuildKit v0.9.0](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.9.0).\n> If you\'re using the `docker` builder (default if `setup-buildx-action` not used),\n> then BuildKit in Docker Engine will be used. As Docker Engine < v22.x.x embeds\n> Buildkit 0.8.2 at the moment, it does not support this feature. It\'s therefore\n> required to use the `setup-buildx-action` at the moment.\n\nBuilding from the current repository automatically uses the [GitHub Token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication),\nso it does not need to be passed. If you want to authenticate against another\nprivate repository, you have to use a [secret](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/secrets)\nnamed `GIT_AUTH_TOKEN` to be able to authenticate against it with Buildx:\n\n```yaml\n      -\n        name: Build and push\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n        with:\n          push: true\n          tags: user/app:latest\n          secrets: |\n            GIT_AUTH_TOKEN=${{ secrets.MYTOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Path context\n\n```yaml\nname: ci\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      -

Feel free to check it out : https://github.com/Ilshidur/actions.\n\n## Compatibility note\n\nAs this Action is containerized with Docker, [it can only run on Linux environments](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/about-actions#types-of-actions).\n\n> Docker container actions can only execute in the GitHub-hosted Linux environment.\n> Self-hosted runners must use a Linux operating system and have Docker installed to run Docker container actions. For more information about the requirements of self-hosted runners, see ""About self-hosted runners.""\n\n<hr/>\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\n- name: Discord notification\n  env:\n    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}\n  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master\n  with:\n    args: \'The project {{ EVENT_PAYLOAD.repository.full_name }} has been deployed.\'\n```\n\n**NOTICE :** for stability purposes, it is recommended to use the action with an explicit commit SHA-1 :\n\n* Version : `uses: ""Ilshidur/action-discord@0.3.2""` (&rarr; link to the releases list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord/releases)\n* Commit SHA-1 : `uses: ""Ilshidur/action-discord@0c4b27844ba47cb1c7bee539c8eead5284ce9fa9""` (&rarr; link to the commits list : https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord/commits/master)\n\n### Arguments\n\nBy default, the GitHub action will send a notificaction with the event informations. Providing the arguments will override the message.\n\n**Environment variables** can be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) :\n\ne.g.: `Action called : {{ GITHUB_ACTION }}`\n\n**Event Payload** data can also be interpolated in the message using brackets (`{{` and `}}`) with the `EVENT_PAYLOAD` variable.\n\ne.g.: `Action called: {{ GITHUB_ACTION }} as {{ EVENT_PAYLOAD.pull_request.id }}`\n\n> See the [event types](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types) for valid payload informations.\n\n#### Examples\n\n* `args = ""Hello, beautiful ! I ran a GitHub Actions for you <3""`\n* `args = ""I showed you my commit. Please respond.""`\n\n### Environment variables\n\n* **`DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** (**required**): the Discord webhook URL (see https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).\n  * ***IMPORTANT !!* You MUST NOT append `/github` at the end of the webhook.**\n* **`DISCORD_USERNAME`** (*optional*): overrides the bot nickname.\n* **`DISCORD_AVATAR`** (*optional*): overrides the avatar URL.\n* **`DISCORD_EMBEDS`** (*optional*): This should be a valid JSON string of an array of Discord `embed` objects. See the [documentation on Discord WebHook Embeds](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/structure/embeds.html) for more information.

154,"b""# GitHub Action to Sync S3 Bucket \xf0\x9f\x94\x84\n\nThis simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote S3 bucket.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### `workflow.yml` Example\n\nPlace in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)\n\nAs of v0.3.0, all [`aws s3 sync` flags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) are optional to allow for maximum customizability (that's a word, I promise) and must be provided by you via `args:`.\n\n#### The following example includes optimal defaults for a public static website:\n\n- `--acl public-read` makes your files publicly readable (make sure your [bucket settings are also set to public](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html)).\n- `--follow-symlinks` won't hurt and fixes some weird symbolic link problems that may come up.\n- Most importantly, `--delete` **permanently deletes** files in the S3 bucket that are **not** present in the latest version of your repository/build.\n- **Optional tip:** If you're uploading the root of your repository, adding `--exclude '.git/*'` prevents your `.git` folder from syncing, which would expose your source code history if your project is closed-source. (To exclude more than one pattern, you must have one `--exclude` flag per exclusion. The single quotes are also important!)\n\n```yaml\nname: Upload Website\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n    - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master\n      with:\n        args: --acl public-read --follow-symlinks --delete\n      env:\n        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}\n        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n        AWS_REGION: 'us-west-1'   # optional: defaults to us-east-1\n        SOURCE_DIR: 'public'      # optional: defaults to entire repository\n```\n\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example.

Examples:\n\n```sh\nPATHS=/index.html\nPATHS=/ /index.html /foo/bar/baz\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can write the list of files to invalidate to a file which\nwill then be slurped into the PATHS variable. This lets you use some other\nmethod to dynamically generate the list of files based on the commit, etc.\nExample workflow steps:\n\n```yaml\n- name: checkout dist\n  uses: actions/checkout@master\n  with:\n    ref: dist\n    # need at least 2 here so we can get a proper log in next step\n    fetch-depth: 2\n\n- name: get updated files\n  run: |\n    # allow grep to fail\n    set +e\n    FILES=$(git log --stat=""1000"" -1 | grep \'|\' | awk \'{print ""/""$1}\' | grep -e \'\\.html$\')\n    set -e\n    [ -z ""$FILES"" ] && touch .updated_files && exit 0\n    for file in $FILES; do\n      echo $file\n      # add bare directory to list of updated paths when we see index.html\n      [[ ""$file"" == *""/index.html"" ]] && echo $file | sed -e \'s/\\/index.html$/\\//\'\n    done | sort | uniq | tr \'\\n\' \' \' > .updated_files\n\n- name: invalidate\n  uses: chetan/invalidate-cloudfront-action@v2\n  env:\n    PATHS_FROM: .updated_files\n    AWS_REGION: \'us-east-1\'\n    DISTRIBUTION: ${{ secrets.DISTRIBUTION }}\n    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n```\n\n### AWS Credentials\n\nThe recommended way to pass AWS credentials to your GitHub actions is to use\n[OpenID\nConnect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services).\n\nOnce configured, you can use the\n[aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)\naction to properly authentication and supply AWS credentials to subsequent steps\nin your workflow.\n\nNote that your workflow will need the following permission when using OIDC:\n\n```yaml\npermissions:\n  id-token: write\n```\n\nFor a complete example, see the [workflow](./.github/workflows/tests.yml) in\nthis repository.\n\nAlso note that if you using the CloudFormation template from the aws repo above,\nthe \'thumbprint\' shown in the example is out of date. I\'ve included a [working\ntemplate](./docs/github-oidc.yaml) complete with the below IAM policy that\nshould work out of the box (as of 2022-01-27).\n\nAs an alternative, you may directly pass an access/secret key pair. See the\nconfig section above.\n\n### AWS IAM Policy\n\nIn order to use this action, you will need to supply credentials which have, at minimum, the following permission:\n\n```json\n{\n    ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n    ""Statement"": [\n        {\n            ""Sid"": ""VisualEditor0"",\n            ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n            ""Action"": ""cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"",\n            ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:cloudfront::<account id>:distribution/<distribution ID>""\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Self-hosted runners\n\nA note regarding [self-hosted\nrunners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners):\n\n`V2` of the `invalidate-cloudfront-action` executes via a bash script on the\nrunner and requires the following additional tools:\n\n- jq 1.6\n- aws 1.x+\n- tr\n- date\n- wget\n\nPlease ensure that they are available on your system or use V1 of the action,\nwhich executes within a docker container.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

See the process [here].\n\nEx. `1.4` branch always points to the newest `v1.4.x` tag, etc.\n\nIn practice:\n\n```yaml\n# For exact version\nsteps:\n  uses: meeDamian/github-release@v2.0.2\n```\n\nOr\n\n```yaml\n# For newest minor version 2.0\nsteps:\n  uses: meeDamian/github-release@2.0\n```\n\nNote: It\'s likely branches will be deprecated once Github Actions fixes its limitation.\n\n[The insane thing]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag#_on_re_tagging\n[here]: .github/workflows/on-tag.yml\n\n\n# License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Then, when Alice opens an issue or PR on that repo, a bot will automatically add a `sponsor \xf0\x9f\x92\x96` label.\n\n![Screenshot of an issue created by a sponsor, with the sponsor label added](screenshot.png)\n\nYou can see the above example here: https://github.com/devonzuegel/highly-exporter/issues/4\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can create a `.github/workflows/label-sponsors.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nname: Label sponsors\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened]\n  issues:\n    types: [opened]\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: is-sponsor-label\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: JasonEtco/is-sponsor-label-action@v1\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nThis will trigger the action when an issue or pull request is opened. You\'ll need to include the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable!\n\nBy default, the label `sponsor` will be applied. If you have a different label you want to use, you can set that:\n\n```yaml\n      - uses: JasonEtco/is-sponsor-label-action@v1\n        with:\n          label: Sponsor Request \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThis action is designed to be triggered by the `issues` or `pull_request` events, specifically the `opened` action. When an issue or PR is opened, the action will make the following query:\n\n```graphql\nquery ($owner: String!) { \n  user (login: $owner) {\n    sponsorshipsAsMaintainer (first: 100) {\n      nodes {\n        sponsor {\n          id\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt will then check to see if the creator of the issue/PR is one of the sponsors in the list. If not, it\'ll try the next page of sponsors until it runs out.\n\n> Note! This query checks to see if the opener is a sponsor of the repository\'s owning user. This does not cover all cases of sponsorship!\n\nIf the opener is a sponsor, the action will then add the `sponsor` label to the issue or pull request.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

160,"b'# `ssh-agent` GitHub Action\n\nThis action \n* starts the `ssh-agent`, \n* exports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable, \n* loads one or several private SSH key into the agent and\n* configures `known_hosts` for GitHub.com.\n\nIt should work in all GitHub Actions virtual environments, including container-based workflows. \n\nWindows and Docker support is, however, somewhat new. Since we have little feedback from the field, things might not run so smooth for you as we\'d hope. If Windows and/or Docker-based workflows work well for you, leave a :+1: at https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent/pull/17.\n\nAlso, using multiple GitHub deployment keys is supported; keys are mapped to repositories by using SSH key comments (see below).\n\n## Why?\n\nWhen running a GitHub Action workflow to stage your project, run tests or build images, you might need to fetch additional libraries or _vendors_ from private repositories.\n\nGitHub Actions only have access to the repository they run for. So, in order to access additional private repositories, create an SSH key with sufficient access privileges. Then, use this action to make the key available with `ssh-agent` on the Action worker node. Once this has been set up, `git clone` commands using `ssh` URLs will _just work_. Also, running `ssh` commands to connect to other servers will be able to use the key.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Generate a new SSH key with sufficient access privileges. For security reasons, don\'t use your personal SSH key but set up a dedicated one for use in GitHub Actions. See below for a few hints if you are unsure about this step.\n2. Make sure you don\'t have a passphrase set on the private key.\n3. Add the public SSH key to the private repository you are pulling from during the Github Action as a \'Deploy Key\'.\n4. Add the private SSH key to the repository triggering the Github Action: \n    * In your repository, go to the *Settings > Secrets* menu and create a new secret. In this example, we\'ll call it `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`. \n    * Put the contents of the *private* SSH key file into the contents field. <br>\n    * This key should start with `-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`, consist of many lines and ends with `-----END ... PRIVATE KEY-----`. \n5. In your workflow definition file, add the following step. Preferably this would be rather on top, near the `actions/checkout@v2` line.\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml\njobs:\n    my_job:\n        ...\n        steps:\n            - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n            # Make sure the @v0.7.0 matches the current version of the action\n            - uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.0\n              with:\n                  ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n            # ... other steps\n```\n5. If, for some reason, you need to change the location of the SSH agent socket, you can use the `ssh-auth-sock` input to provide a path.\n\n### Using Multiple Keys\n\nThere are cases where you might need to use multiple keys. For example, ""[deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)"" might be limited to a single repository, so you\'ll need several of them.\n\nYou can set up different keys as different secrets and pass them all to the action like so:\n\n```yaml\n# ... contents as before\n            - uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.0\n              with:\n                  ssh-private-key: |\n                        ${{ secrets.FIRST_KEY }}\n                        ${{ secrets.NEXT_KEY }}\n                        ${{ secrets.ANOTHER_KEY }}\n```\n\nThe `ssh-agent` will load all of the keys and try each one in order when establishing SSH connections.\n\nThere\'s one **caveat**, though: SSH servers may abort the connection attempt after a number of mismatching keys have been presented. So if, for example, you have six different keys loaded into the `ssh-agent`, but the server aborts after five unknown keys, the last key (which might be the right one) will never even be tried. But when you\'re using GitHub Deploy Keys, read on!\n\n### Support for GitHub Deploy Keys\n\nWhen using **Github deploy keys**, GitHub servers will accept the _first_ known key. But since deploy keys are scoped to a single repository, this might not be the key needed to access a particular repository. Thus, you will get the error message `fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.` if the wrong key/repository combination is tried.\n\nTo support picking the right key in this use case, this action scans _key comments_ and will set up extra Git and SSH configuration to make things work.\n\n1. When creating the deploy key for a repository like `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` or `https://github.com/owner/repo`, put that URL into the key comment. (Hint: Try `ssh-keygen ... -C ""git@github.com:owner/repo.git""`.)\n2. After keys have been added to the agent, this action will scan the key comments. \n3. For key comments containing such URLs, a Git config setting is written that uses [`url.<base>.insteadof`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-urlltbasegtinsteadOf). It will redirect `git` requests to URLs starting with either `https://github.com/owner/repo` or `git@github.com:owner/repo` to a fake hostname/URL like `git@...some.hash...:owner/repo`.\n4. An SSH configuration section is generated that applies to the fake hostname. It will map the SSH connection back to `github.com`, while at the same time pointing SSH to a file containing the appropriate key\'s public part. That will make SSH use the right key when connecting to GitHub.com.\n\n## Action Inputs\n\nThe following inputs can be used to control the action\'s behavior:\n\n* `ssh-private-key`: Required. Use this to provide the key(s) to load as GitHub Actions secrets.\n* `ssh-auth-sock`: Can be used to control where the SSH agent socket will be placed. Ultimately affects the `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable.\n* `log-public-key`: Set this to `false` if you want to suppress logging of _public_ key information. To simplify debugging and since it contains public key information only, this is turned on by default.\n* `ssh-agent-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `ssh-agent` binary.\n* `ssh-add-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `ssh-add` binary.\n* `git-cmd`: Optional. Use this to specify a custom location for the `git` binary.\n\n## Exported variables\n\nThe action exports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variables through the Github Actions core module.\nThe `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is used by several applications like git or rsync to connect to the SSH authentication agent.\nThe `$SSH_AGENT_PID` contains the process id of the agent. This is used to kill the agent in post job action.\n\n## Known Issues and Limitations\n\n### Works for the Current Job Only\n\nSince each job [runs in a fresh instance](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions#job) of the virtual environment, the SSH key will only be available in the job where this action has been referenced. You can, of course, add the action in multiple jobs or even workflows. All instances can use the same `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.\n\n### SSH Private Key Format\n\nIf the private key is not in the `PEM` format, you will see an `Error loading key ""(stdin)"": invalid format` message.\n\nUse `ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem` to convert your key file to `PEM`, but be sure to make a backup of the file first \xf0\x9f\x98\x89.\n\n## Additional Information for Particular Tools or Platforms\n\nIf you know that your favorite tool or platform of choice requires extra tweaks or has some caveats when running with SSH, feel free to open a PR to amend this section here.\n\n### Container-based Workflows\n\nIf you are using this action on container-based workflows, make sure the container has the necessary SSH binaries or package(s) installed.\n\n### Building Docker Images and/or Using the `docker/build-push-action` Action\n\nWhen you are building Docker images with `docker build` or `docker compose build` and need to provide the SSH keys to the build, don\'t forget to pass `--ssh default=${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}` on the command line to pass the SSH agent socket through. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#ssh) for more information on this option.\n\nIf you are using the `docker/build-push-action`, you can do so by adding the following config.\n\n```yml\n      - name: Build and push\n        id: docker_build\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2\n        with:\n          ssh: |\n            default=${{ env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK }}\n```\n\nMake sure not to miss the next section, though.\n\n### Using Multiple Deploy Keys Inside Docker Builds\n\nWhen you pass the SSH agent socket to the Docker build environment _and_ want to use multiple GitHub deploy keys, you need to copy the Git and SSH configuration files to the build environment as well. This is necessary _in addition to_ forwarding the SSH agent socket into the build process. The config files are required so that Git can pick the right one from your deployment keys.\n\nThis requires an additional step in the workflow file **after** the `ssh-agent` step and **before** the Docker build step.  You also need two additional lines in the `Dockerfile` to actually copy the configs.\n\nThe following example will: \n* collect the necessary Git and SSH configuration files in a directory that must be part of the Docker build context so that... \n* ... the files can be copied into the Docker image (or an intermediate build stage).\n\nWorkflow:\n\n```yml\n      - name: ssh-agent setup\n        ...\n\n      - name: Collect Git and SSH config files in a directory that is part of the Docker build context\n        run: |\n          mkdir root-config\n          cp -r ~/.gitconfig  ~/.ssh root-config/\n  \n      - name: Docker build \n        # build-push-action | docker [compose] build | etc.\n        ...\n```\n\nDockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Copy the two files in place and fix different path/locations inside the Docker image\nCOPY root-config /root/\nRUN sed \'s|/home/runner|/root|g\' -i.bak /root/.ssh/config\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the resulting Docker image now might contain these customized Git and SSH configuration files! Your private SSH keys are never written to files anywhere, just loaded into the SSH agent and forwarded into the container. The config files might, however, give away details about your build or development process and contain the names and URLs of your (private) repositories. You might want to use a multi-staged build to make sure these files do not end up in the final image.\n\nIf you still get the error message: `fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.`, you most likely forgot one of the steps above.\n\n### Cargo\'s (Rust) Private Dependencies on Windows\n\nIf you are using private repositories in your dependencies like this:\n\n```\nstuff = { git = ""ssh://git@github.com/myorg/stuff.git"", branch = ""main"" }\n```\n\n... you will need to change a configuration in the workflow for Windows machines in order to make cargo able to clone private repositories.\n\nThere are 2 ways you can achieve this:\n\n1. Add this step once in your job **before** any cargo command:\n\n```\n      - name: Update cargo config to use Git CLI\n        run: Set-Content -Path $env:USERPROFILE\\.cargo\\config.toml ""[net]`ngit-fetch-with-cli = true""\n```\n\nThis will configure Cargo to use the Git CLI as explained in the [Cargo\'s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#netgit-fetch-with-cli).\n\n2. Alternatively you can set it to the environment variables for the entire workflow:\n\n```\nenv:\n  CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI: true\n```\n\n### Using Deploy Keys with Swift Package Manager\n\n`xcodebuild` by default uses Xcode\'s built-in Git tooling. If you want to use GitHub Deploy Keys as supported by this action, however, that version of Git will lack the necessary URL remapping. In this case, pass `-scmProvider system` to the `xcodebuild` command, as mentioned in [Apple\'s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/building_swift_packages_or_apps_that_use_them_in_continuous_integration_workflows#3680255).\n\n## What this Action *cannot* do for you\n\nThe following items are not issues, but beyond what this Action is supposed to do.\n\n### Work on Remote Machines\n\nWhen using `ssh` to connect from the GitHub Action worker node to another machine, you *can* forward the SSH Agent socket and use your private key on the other (remote) machine. However, this Action will not configure `known_hosts` or other SSH settings on the remote machine for you.\n\n### Provide the SSH Key as a File\n\nThis Action is designed to pass the SSH key directly into `ssh-agent`; that is, the key is available in memory on the GitHub Action worker node, but never written to disk. As a consequence, you _cannot_ pass the key as a build argument or a mounted file into Docker containers that you build or run on the worker node. You _can_, however, mount the `ssh-agent` Unix socket into a Docker container that you _run_, set up the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env var and then use SSH from within the container (see https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent/issues/11).\n\n### Run `ssh-keyscan` to Add Host Keys for Additional Hosts\n\nIf you want to use `ssh-keyscan` to add additional hosts (that you own/know) to the `known_hosts` file, you can do so with a single shell line in your Action definition. You don\'t really need this Action to do this for you.\n\nAs a side note, using `ssh-keyscan` without proper key verification is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. You might prefer putting your _known_ SSH host key in your own Action files to add it to the `known_hosts` file. The SSH host key is not secret and can safely be committed into the repo. \n\n## Creating SSH Keys\n\nIn order to create a new SSH key, run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f path/to/keyfile`, as suggested in [this blog post](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html). \nIf you need to work with some older server software and need RSA keys, try `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -f path/to/keyfile` instead.\n\nBoth commands will prompt you for a key passphrase and save the key in `path/to/keyfile`.\nIn general, having a passphrase is a good thing, since it will keep the key encrypted on your disk. When using the key with this action, however, you need to make sure you don\'t \nspecify a passphrase: The key must be usable without reading the passphrase from input. Since the key itself is stored using GitHub\'s ""Secret"" feature, it should be fairly safe anyway.\n\n## Authorizing a Key\n\nTo actually grant the SSH key access, you can \xe2\x80\x93 on GitHub \xe2\x80\x93 use at least two ways:\n\n* [Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be added to individual GitHub repositories. They can give read and/or write access to the particular repository. When pulling a lot of dependencies, however, you\'ll end up adding the key in many places. Rotating the key probably becomes difficult. The deploy key needs to be added to the private repository that is being fetched as a private dependency.\n\n* A [machine user](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) can be used for more fine-grained permissions management and have access to multiple repositories with just one instance of the key being registered. It will, however, count against your number of users on paid GitHub plans.\n\n## Hacking\n\nAs a note to my future self, in order to work on this repo:\n\n* Clone it\n* Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies\n* _hack hack hack_\n* `node index.js`. Inputs are passed through `INPUT_` env vars with their names uppercased.\n\n  On *nix use:\n  ```bash\n  env ""INPUT_SSH-PRIVATE-KEY=\\`cat file\\`"" node index.js\n  ```\n\n  On Windows (cmd):\n  ```cmd\n  set /P INPUT_SSH-PRIVATE-KEY=< file\n  node index.js\n  ```\n\n  On Windows (PowerShell):\n  ```ps\n  ${env:INPUT_SSH-PRIVATE-KEY} = (Get-Content .\\test-keys -Raw); node index.js\n  node index.js\n  ```\n* Run `npm run build` to update `dist/*`, which holds the files actually run\n* Read https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-javascript-action if unsure.\n* Maybe update the README example when publishing a new version.\n\n## Credits, Copyright and License\n\nThis action was written by webfactory GmbH, Bonn, Germany.

161,"b'# NOTICE: This action is no longer being maintained\n\nDue the maintainer passing away, this action is no longer being maintained as of Janyary 2023.\n\nDevelopment has moved to [onyxmueller/build-tag-number](https://github.com/onyxmueller/build-tag-number) and the action is available on the Marketplace here: <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-tag-number>\n\nUpdating your existing Github Actions workflows should be as simple as replacing `einaregilsson/build-number@v3` with `onyxmueller/build-tag-number@v1`\n\nSee the repo linked above for more information.\n\n## Update 2020-02-12\n\nGitHub has just introduced new environment variables, `GITHUB_RUN_ID` and `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` which are unique numbers for each workflow run, so you\'re probably better off using those than this GitHub action. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 See https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables\n\n# build-number\nGitHub action for generating sequential build numbers for GitHub actions. The build number is stored in your GitHub repository as a ref, it doesn\'t add any extra commits to your repository. Use in your workflow like so:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Generate build number\n      uses: einaregilsson/build-number@v3\n      with:\n        token: ${{secrets.github_token}}        \n    - name: Print new build number\n      run: echo ""Build number is $BUILD_NUMBER""\n      # Or, if you\'re on Windows: echo ""Build number is ${env:BUILD_NUMBER}""\n```\n\nAfter that runs the subsequent steps in your job will have the environment variable `BUILD_NUMBER` available. If you prefer to be more explicit you can use the output of the step, like so:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Generate build number\n      id: buildnumber\n      uses: einaregilsson/build-number@v3 \n      with:\n        token: ${{secrets.github_token}}        \n    \n    # Now you can pass ${{ steps.buildnumber.outputs.build_number }} to the next steps.\n    - name: Another step as an example\n      uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v1\n      with:\n        who-to-greet: ${{ steps.buildnumber.outputs.build_number }}\n```\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is defined by GitHub already for you. See [virtual environments for GitHub actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret) for more information.\n\n## Getting the build number in other jobs\n\nFor other steps in the same job you can use the methods above,\nto actually get the build number in other jobs you need to use [job outputs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjobs_idoutputs) mechanism:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  job1:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      build_number: ${{ steps.buildnumber.outputs.build_number }}\n    steps:\n    - name: Generate build number\n      id: buildnumber\n      uses: einaregilsson/build-number@v3 \n      with:\n        token: ${{secrets.github_token}}\n          \n  job2:\n    needs: job1\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Another step as an example\n      uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v1\n      with:\n        who-to-greet: ${{needs.job1.outputs.build_number}}\n```\n\n## Setting the initial build number.\n\nIf you\'re moving from another build system, you might want to start from some specific number. The `build-number` action simply uses a special tag name to store the build number, `build-number-x`, so you can just create and push a tag with the number you want to start on. E.g. do\n\n```\ngit tag build-number-500\ngit push origin build-number-500\n```\n\nand then your next build number will be 501. The action will always delete older refs that start with `build-number-`, e.g. when it runs and finds `build-number-500` it will create a new tag, `build-number-501` and then delete `build-number-500`.\n\n## Generating multiple independent build numbers\n\nSometimes you may have more than one project to build in one repository. For example you may have a client and a server in the same github repository that you would like to generate independent build numbers for. Another example is you have two Dockerfiles in one repo and you\'d like to version each of the built images with their own numbers.  \nTo do this, use the `prefix` key, like so:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Generate build number\n      id: buildnumber\n      uses: einaregilsson/build-number@v3 \n      with:\n        token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}\n        prefix: client\n```\n\nThis will generate a git tag like `client-build-number-1`.\n\nIf you then do the same in another workflow and use `prefix: server` then you\'ll get a second build-number tag called `server-build-number-1`.\n\n## Branches and build numbers\n\nThe build number generator is global, there\'s no concept of special build numbers for special branches unless handled manually with the `prefix` property. It\'s probably something you would just use on builds from your master branch. It\'s just one number that gets increased every time the action is run.\n\nSo, that\'s it. Hope you can use it.

The content of the file should be in the following format:\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  # Replace pull_request with pull_request_target if you\n  # plan to use this action with forks, see the Limitations section\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\n# Down scope as necessary via https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token\npermissions:\n  checks: write\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      # Install your linters here\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          # Enable your linters here\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nAll linters are disabled by default. To enable a linter, simply set the option with its name to `true`, e.g. `eslint: true`.\n\nThe action doesn\'t install the linters for you; you are responsible for installing them in your CI environment.\n\n### JavaScript example (ESLint and Prettier)\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n        with:\n          node-version: 12\n\n      # ESLint and Prettier must be in `package.json`\n      - name: Install Node.js dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          eslint: true\n          prettier: true\n```\n\n**Important:** Make sure to exclude the `.github` directory in your ESLint and Prettier configs as the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` **cannot** be used to update workflow files due to the missing `workflow` permission. See [Limitations](#limitations).\n\n### PHP example (PHP_CodeSniffer)\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up PHP\n        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n        with:\n          php-version: ""7.4""\n          coverage: none\n          tools: phpcs\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          php_codesniffer: true\n          # Optional: Ignore warnings\n          php_codesniffer_args: ""-n""\n```\n\nIf you prefer to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) you can also use this:\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up PHP\n        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2\n        with:\n          php-version: ""7.4""\n          coverage: none\n          tools: composer\n\n      - name: Install PHP dependencies\n        run: |\n          composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-ansi --no-interaction\n          echo ""${PWD}/vendor/bin"" >> $GITHUB_PATH\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          php_codesniffer: true\n```\n\n### Python example (Flake8 and Black)\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v1\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.8\n\n      - name: Install Python dependencies\n        run: pip install black flake8\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          black: true\n          flake8: true\n```\n\n### C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ example (clang_format)\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Install ClangFormat\n        run: sudo apt-get install -y clang-format\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          clang_format: true\n```\n\n### C# and VB.NET example (dotnet_format)\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up .NET\n        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1\n        with:\n          dotnet-version: ""6.0.x""\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          dotnet_format: true\n```\n\n### AutoFix example\n\n```yml\nname: Lint\n\non:\n  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,\n  # but only for the main branch\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  run-linters:\n    name: Run linters\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v1\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.8\n\n      - name: Install Python dependencies\n        run: pip install black flake8\n\n      - name: Run linters\n        uses: wearerequired/lint-action@v2\n        with:\n          auto_fix: true\n          black: true\n          black_auto_fix: true\n          flake8: true\n          flake8_auto_fix: false\n```\n\nWith `auto_fix` set to `true`, by default the action will try and fix code issues automatically and commit and push them automatically. Here however, `flake8` linter does not support auto-fixing, so setting `flake8_auto_fix` to `false` will prevent any unnecessary warnings.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Linter-specific options\n\n`[linter]` can be one of `autopep8`, `black`, `clang_format`, `dotnet_format`, `erblint`, `eslint`, `flake8`, `gofmt`, `golint`, `mypy`, `oitnb`, `php_codesniffer`, `prettier`, `pylint`, `rubocop`, `stylelint`, `swift_format_official`, `swift_format_lockwood`, `swiftlint` and `xo`:\n\n- **`[linter]`:** Enables the linter in your repository. Default: `false`\n- **`[linter]_args`**: Additional arguments to pass to the linter. Example: `eslint_args: ""--max-warnings 0""` if ESLint checks should fail even if there are no errors and only warnings. Default: `""""`\n- **`[linter]_dir`**: Directory where the linting command should be run. Example: `eslint_dir: server/` if ESLint is installed in the `server` subdirectory. Default: Repository root\n- **`[linter]_extensions`:** Extensions of files to check with the linter. Example: `eslint_extensions: js,ts` to lint JavaScript and TypeScript files with ESLint. Default: Varies by linter, see [`action.yml`](./action.yml)\n- **`[linter]_command_prefix`:** Command prefix to be run before the linter command. Default: `""""`.\n- **`[linter]_auto_fix`:** Whether the linter should try to fix code style issues automatically. This option is useful to commit and push changes only for specific linters and not all of them when `auto_fix` option is set. Default: `true` if linter supports auto-fixing, `false` if not.\n\n### General options\n\n- **`github_token`:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` to [authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow). Defaults to the GitHub token.\n\n- **`continue_on_error`:** Whether the workflow run should also fail when linter failures are detected. Default: `true`\n\n- **`auto_fix`:** Whether linters should try to fix code style issues automatically. If some issues can be fixed, the action will apply the needed changes. Default: `false`\n\n  <p align=""center"">\n    <img src=""./.github/screenshots/auto-fix.png"" alt=""Screenshot of auto-fix commit"" width=""80%"" />\n  </p>\n\n- **`commit`:** Whether to commit and push the changes made by `auto_fix`. Default: `true`\n\n- **`git_name`**: Username for auto-fix commits. Default: `""Lint Action""`\n\n- **`git_email`**: Email address for auto-fix commits. Default: `""lint-action@samuelmeuli.com""`\n\n- **`git_no_verify`**: Bypass the pre-commit and pre-push git hooks. Default: `false`\n\n- **`commit_message`**: Template for auto-fix commit messages. The `${linter}` variable can be used to insert the name of the linter. Default: `""Fix code style issues with ${linter}""`\n\n- **`check_name`**: Template for the [name of the check run](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#create-a-check-run). Use this to ensure unique names when the action is used more than once in a workflow. The `${linter}` and `${dir}` variables can be used to insert the name and directory of the linter. Default: `""${linter}""`\n\n- **`neutral_check_on_warning`:** Whether the check run should conclude with a neutral status instead of success when the linter finds only warnings. Default: `false`\n\n### Linter support\n\nSome options are not available for specific linters:\n\n| Linter                | auto-fixing | extensions |\n| --------------------- | :---------: | :--------: |\n| autopep8              |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (py)   |\n| black                 |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| clang_format          |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| clippy                |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (rs)   |\n| dotnet_format         |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (cs)   |\n| erblint               |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (erb)  |\n| eslint                |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| flake8                |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| gofmt                 |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (go)   |\n| golint                |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (go)   |\n| mypy                  |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (py)   |\n| oitnb                 |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| php_codesniffer       |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| prettier              |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| pylint                |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (py)   |\n| rubocop               |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (rb)   |\n| rustfmt               |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (rs)   |\n| stylelint             |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| swift_format_official |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n| swift_format_lockwood |     \xe2\x9c\x85      | \xe2\x9d\x8c (swift) |\n| swiftlint             |     \xe2\x9c\x85      | \xe2\x9d\x8c (swift) |\n| tsc                   |     \xe2\x9d\x8c      |  \xe2\x9d\x8c (ts)   |\n| xo                    |     \xe2\x9c\x85      |     \xe2\x9c\x85     |\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Pull requests\n\nThere are currently some limitations as to how this action (or any other action) can be used in the context of `pull_request` events from forks:\n\n- The action doesn\'t have permission to push auto-fix changes to the fork. This is because the `pull_request` event runs on the upstream repo, where the `github_token` is lacking permissions for the fork. [Source](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Can-t-push-to-forked-repository-on-the-original-repository-s/m-p/35916/highlight/true#M2372)\n- The action doesn\'t have permission to create annotations for commits on forks unless you use the `pull_request_target` event. You can modify the default permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` by using the `permissions` key and set the `checks` scope to `write`. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) for more.\n\n### Auto-fixing workflow files\n\nIf `auto_fix` is enabled and the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used, none of the linters should be allowed to change files in `.github/workflows` as the token doesn\'t have the necessary `workflow` permission.

165,"b'# Code Review Checklist\n\nThis repository contains a checklist of common issues to be used when conducting code reviews as well as a Github Action which automatically posts the checklist when a new pull request is created.\n\n# The Checklist\n\nThe checklist can be found in [checklist.md](./checklist.md). If you would like to suggest changes, please submit a pull request to this repository.\n\n# GitHub Action\n\nTo set up the github action in a new repository, create a folder named `.github` in the repository root, and inside create a file named `main.workflow`. (If the repository already has actions set up then skip this step, the file will already exist.)\n\nAdd the following to the workflow file.\n\n```\nworkflow ""PR Checklist"" {\n  on = ""pull_request""\n  resolves = [""Create PR Comment""]\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a new workflow named `PR Checklist` which will be triggered every time a pull request is created (`on = ""pull_request""`). When triggered, it will run an action named `Create PR Comment`. Define that action by adding the following:\n\n```\naction ""Create PR Comment"" {\n  uses = ""cognisant/code-review-checklist@master""\n  secrets = [""GITHUB_TOKEN""]\n}\n```\n\nThis creates an action named `Create PR Comment`, and the `uses` statement instructs github actions to find and run the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) in this repository. If you would like to pin the action to a specific commit, you can replace `@master` with a commit hash or tag. The line `secrets = [""GITHUB_TOKEN""]` supplies a token into the dockerfile which will allow the scripts inside the container to access the GitHub API.\n\nFinally save the workflow, and whenever a Pull Request is created in the repository a comment will be automatically posted containing the contents of [checklist.md](./checklist.md).\n\n![screenshot 2019-03-06 at 15 38 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/548432/53967984-234aa780-40ee-11e9-9474-6c67ac39a70b.png)\n\nNOTE: The workflow will only execute for pull requests on branches which contain `.github/main.workflow`, so any existing branches will need to be updated if you have made these changes on master.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Don\'t include this directly in the workflow file, instead you must use [Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) | When `REPO` is an SSH URL |\n| `KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE` | Path to a file in the repository that contains the known SSH fingerprints for the target host. | When the target host is not github.com |\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN`     | Should always be equal to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` | When `REPO = self` |\n| `SQUASH_HISTORY`   | If set to `true`, all previous commits on the target branch will be discarded. For example, if you are deploying a static site with lots of binary artifacts, this can help the repository becoming overly bloated. | No |\n| `SKIP_EMPTY_COMMITS` | If set to `true`, commits will only be pushed if the contents of the target branch will be changed as a result. This is useful if, for example, you\'d like to easily track which upstream changes result in changes to your target branch. | No |\n| `MESSAGE`          | A custom template to use as the commit message pushed to the target branch. See [custom commit messages](#custom-commit-messages). | No |\n| `TAG` | A string following the [git-check-ref-format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format) that tags the commit with a lightweight git-tag. |\xc2\xa0No |\n| `CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE` | An optional path to a file to use as a list of globs defining which files to delete when clearing the target branch. |\xc2\xa0No |\n| `COMMIT_NAME` | The username the autogenerated commit will use. If unset, uses the commit pusher\'s username. | No |\n| `COMMIT_EMAIL` | The email the autogenerated commit will use. If unset, uses the commit pusher\'s email. | No |\n| `TARGET_DIR` | An optional string to change the directory where the files are copied to. |\xc2\xa0No |\n\n\n### Custom commit messages\n\nYou can specify a custom string to use in the commit message\nwhen pushing to your target repository.\nThese strings support a number of placeholders that will be replaces with\nrelevant values:\n\n| Placeholder        | Description                                           |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| `{target-branch}`  | The name of the target branch being updated           |\n| `{sha}`            | The 7-character sha of the HEAD of the current branch |\n| `{long-sha}`       | The full sha of the HEAD of the current branch        |\n| `{msg}`            | The commit message for the HEAD of the current branch |\n\nExample Usage:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    - uses: s0/git-publish-subdir-action@develop\n      env:\n        # ...\n        MESSAGE: ""This updates the content to the commit {sha} that had the message:\\n{msg}""\n```\n\n### Custom clear operations\n\nBy default, this action will clear the target branch of any pre-existing files,\nand only keep those that are defined in the target `FOLDER` when the action was\nrun.\n\nThis can now be overwritten by specifying a file with a custom list of globs to\ndefine which files should be deleted from the target branch before copying the\nnew files over.\n\nThe environment variable `CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE` should point to the path of the\nglob file (which can have any name) relative to root of the target repository.\n\n**Note: using this feature will disable the default functionality of deleting\neverything, and you will need to specify exactly what needs to be deleted.**\n\n#### Examples\n\n1. Default behaviour:\n\n   ```\n   **/*\n   !.git\n   ```\n\n1. Default behaviour with a custom target directory:\n\n   ```\n   target_dir/**/*\n   !.git\n   ```\n\n1. Delete everything except the `.git` and `foobar` folder:\n\n   ```\n   **/*\n   !.git\n   !foobar/**/*\n   ```\n\n1. Only delete the folder `folder` (except `folder/a`), and also delete anything\n   matching `ini*al2`:\n\n   ```\n   folder/*\n   !folder/a\n   ini*al2\n   ```\n\nFor clarity, if we have the file `.clear-target-files`:\n\n```\nfolder/*\n!folder/a\nini*al2\n```\n\nAnd the workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    - uses: s0/git-publish-subdir-action@develop\n      env:\n        # ...\n        CLEAR_GLOBS_FILE: "".clear-target-files""\n```\n\nAnd the target branch already had the files:\n\n```\ninitial1\ninitial2\nfolder/a\nfolder/b\n```\n\nThen the files that would remain would be:\n\n```\nfolder/a\ninitial1\n```\n\nAn empty file can be used to indicate that the branch should not be cleared at\nall.\n\n\n\n## Usage with [Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys)\n\nWhen pushing to other repositories on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise,\nthe recommended mechanism is to use [Deploy Keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) rather than your own private SSH key.\nDeploy keys are SSH keys that can be added to specific repositories to be given write access to only\nthose repositories.\nThis is preferable to adding your own personal ssh private key to a repository\'s secrets store,\nas it means that any actions that have access to this repository\'s secrets can only push\nto repositories that have explicitly had the SSH key added as a deploy key,\nand not *all* repositories that your user account have access to.\n\nUse `ssh-keygen` to create a new ssh key, add these to GitHub in the relevant repo\'s deploy keys and Secrets, then delete them off your computer.\n\n```\n> cd /tmp\n> ssh-keygen -t ed25519\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/sam/.ssh/id_ed25519): temp-deploy-key\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in temp-deploy-key.\nYour public key has been saved in temp-deploy-key.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:tQBSeWjZ4Er4YYjK4XQ4npfiK2xJPJLbGjTsYJq/9JI sam@optimus\nThe key\'s randomart image is:\n+--[ED25519 256]--+\n|    ..+*         |\n| ..o o=.o        |\n|.=o.+.... .      |\n|B =+.o   o .     |\n|+% oo   S .      |\n|X=+              |\n|B=+.             |\n|oBE.             |\n|+ooo.            |\n+----[SHA256]-----+\n> cat temp-deploy-key.pub\nssh-ed25519 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX user@localhost\n> cat temp-deploy-key\n-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
167,"b'# \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80 SCP for GitHub Actions\n\n[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for copying files and artifacts via SSH.\n\n[![Actions Status](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action/workflows/scp%20files/badge.svg)](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action/actions)\n\n**Important**: Only support **Linux** [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.\n\n## Usage\n\nCopy files and artifacts via SSH:\n\n```yaml\nname: scp files\non: [push]\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    name: Build\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: copy file via ssh password\n      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n      with:\n        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n        password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}\n        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n        source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n        target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\n## Input variables\n\nSee the [action.yml](./action.yml) file for more detail information.\n\n* host - scp remote host\n* port - scp remote port, default is `22`\n* username - scp username\n* password - scp password\n* passphrase - the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key\n* fingerprint - fingerprint SHA256 of the host public key, default is to skip verification\n* timeout - timeout for ssh to remote host, default is `30s`\n* command_timeout - timeout for scp command, default is `10m`\n* key - content of ssh private key. ex raw content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n* key_path - path of ssh private key\n* target - target path on the server, must be a directory (**required**)\n* source - scp file list (**required**)\n* rm - remove target folder before upload data, default is `false`\n* strip_components - remove the specified number of leading path elements.\n* overwrite - use `--overwrite` flag with tar, overwrite existing files when extracting\n* tar_tmp_path - temporary path for tar file on the dest host\n* tar_exec - path to tar executable on the dest host. default is `tar`\n* tar_dereference - use `--dereference` flag with tar, follow symlinks; archive and dump the files they point to\n* use_insecure_cipher - include more ciphers with use_insecure_cipher (see [#15](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action/issues/15))\n\nSSH Proxy Setting:\n\n* proxy_host - proxy host\n* proxy_port - proxy port, default is `22`\n* proxy_username - proxy username\n* proxy_password - proxy password\n* proxy_passphrase - the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key\n* proxy_timeout - timeout for ssh to proxy host, default is `30s`\n* proxy_key - content of ssh proxy private key.\n* proxy_key_path - path of ssh proxy private key\n* proxy_fingerprint - fingerprint SHA256 of the host public key, default is to skip verification\n* proxy_use_insecure_cipher - include more ciphers with use_insecure_cipher (see [#15](https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action/issues/15))\n\n## Setting up a SSH Key\n\nMake sure to follow the below steps while creating SSH Keys and using them.\nThe best practice is create the SSH Keys on local machine not remote machine.\nLogin with username specified in Github Secrets. Generate a RSA Key-Pair:\n\n```bash\n# rsa\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n\n# ed25519\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n```\n\nAdd newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).\n\n```bash\n# rsa\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B \'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\'\n\n# d25519\ncat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh b@B \'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys\'\n```\n\nCopy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.\n\n```bash\n# rsa\nclip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n# ed25519\nclip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nSee the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html).\n\n**A note** from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:\n\n* Put the public key in `.ssh/authorized_keys2`\n* Change the permissions of `.ssh` to 700\n* Change the permissions of `.ssh/authorized_keys2` to 640\n\n### If you are using OpenSSH\n\nIf you are currently using OpenSSH and are getting the following error:\n\n```bash\nssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey]\n```\n\nMake sure that your key algorithm of choice is supported.\nOn Ubuntu 20.04 or later you must explicitly allow the use of the ssh-rsa algorithm. Add the following line to your OpenSSH daemon file (which is either `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or a drop-in file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):\n\n```bash\nCASignatureAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\n```\n\nAlternatively, `ed25519` keys are accepted by default in OpenSSH. You could use this instead of rsa if needed:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 200 -C ""your_email@example.com""\n```\n\n## Example\n\nCopy file via a SSH password:\n\n```yaml\n- name: copy file via ssh password\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n    host: example.com\n    username: foo\n    password: bar\n    port: 22\n    source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nCopy file via a SSH key:\n\n```yaml\n- name: copy file via ssh key\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n    source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nExample configuration for ignore list:\n\n```yaml\n- name: copy file via ssh key\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n    source: ""tests/*.txt,!tests/a.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nExample configuration for multiple servers:\n\n```diff\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n-   host: ""example.com""\n+   host: ""foo.com,bar.com""\n    username: foo\n    password: bar\n    port: 22\n    source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nExample configuration for exclude custom files:\n\n```yaml\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n    host: ""example.com""\n    username: foo\n    password: bar\n    port: 22\n-   source: ""tests/*.txt""\n+   source: ""tests/*.txt,!tests/a.txt,!tests/b.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nUpload artifact files to remote server:\n\n```yaml\n  deploy:\n    name: deploy artifact\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - run: echo hello > world.txt\n\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: my-artifact\n        path: world.txt\n\n    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: my-artifact\n        path: distfiles\n\n    - name: copy file to server\n      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n      with:\n        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n        key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n        source: distfiles/*\n        target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nRemove the specified number of leading path elements:\n\n```yaml\n- name: remove the specified number of leading path elements\n  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n    port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n    source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n    target: your_server_target_folder_path\n    strip_components: 1\n```\n\nOld target structure:\n\n```sh\nfoobar\n  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 tests\n    \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 a.txt\n    \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 b.txt\n```\n\nNew target structure:\n\n```sh\nfoobar\n  \xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 a.txt\n  \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 b.txt\n```\n\nOnly copy files that are newer than the corresponding destination files:\n\n```yaml\n  changes:\n    name: test changed-files\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Get changed files\n      id: changed-files\n      uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35\n      with:\n        since_last_remote_commit: true\n        separator: "",""\n\n    - name: copy file to server\n      uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n      with:\n        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n        key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}\n        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n        source: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}\n        target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nProtecting a Private Key. The purpose of the passphrase is usually to encrypt the private key. This makes the key file by itself useless to an attacker. It is not uncommon for files to leak from backups or decommissioned hardware, and hackers commonly exfiltrate files from compromised systems.\n\n```diff\n  - name: ssh key with passphrase\n    uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.4\n    with:\n      host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}\n      username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}\n      key: ${{ secrets.SSH2 }}\n+     passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}\n      port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}\n      source: ""tests/a.txt,tests/b.txt""\n      target: your_server_target_folder_path\n```\n\nWhen copying files from a Linux runner to a Windows server, you should:\n\n1. Download git for Windows\n2. Change the default OpenSSH shell to git bach with the following powershell command.\n3. Set `tar_dereference` and `rm` variable to `true` in the YAML file\n4. Avoid putting the `port` value through a variable\n5.

If not set, the default `-v -r *` will be used.\n\n```yml\n    - name: Link Checker\n      uses: peter-evans/link-checker@v1\n      with:\n        args: -v -r *\n```\n\nSee [Liche's documentation](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche) for further argument details.\n\n#### Optional environment variables\n\nIf Link Checker finds connectivity problems with links the action will output a markdown file containing the error report.\nThe default path is `link-checker/out.md`. The path and filename may be overridden with the following variables.\n\n- `LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_DIR` - The output directory the markdown error report\n- `LINKCHECKER_OUTPUT_FILENAME` - The error report filename\n\n#### Receiving issues containing the error report\n\nBelow is an example of using this action in conjunction with [Create Issue From File](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file).

Using this\naction will add `nuget` to your `$PATH` on all operating systems, including\nmacOS and linux, without having to prefix it with `mono`.\n\nNuGet functionality also gets delivered with Visual Studio, msbuild and dotnet SDK. You should consider using the\nofficial [`setup-dotnet`](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) or\n[one of the `msbuild` actions](https://github.com/marketplace?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=msbuild).\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\nSupported values for `nuget-version`:\n\n* `latest` -- the latest blessed NuGet release.\n* `preview` -- the latest EarlyAccessPreview release.\n* `X.Y.Z` -- concrete semver version for a release (e.g. `5.3.1`).\n* semver range -- any [valid semver range specifier](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges) (e.g. `5`, `>=5`, `5.3.x`, etc)\n\nThis action also supports configuring your NuGet API key using\n[GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).\nThe API key should be passed in as an `nuget-api-key` input.

174,"b'# GitHub Action to Deploy Static Assets to GitHub Pages\n\n**This action has been deprecated.\nThere\'s [now ""native"" support for publishing to GitHub Pages using an official GitHub action by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages).\nIt is much better than this approach.**\n\n<!-- badges: start -->\n[![Actions Status](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghpages/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghpages/actions)\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\nThis action simply lets you deploy arbitrary folders of static content from your workflow\'s working directory (`/github/workspace`) to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).\nThis works by having your action instance `git push` your chosen asset folder (`BUILD_DIR`) to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository for the `gh-pages` branch to be served.\nIf you are running this action inside an [organization or user repository](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) (named `username/username.github.io`) it will deploy to the `master` branch instead.\n\nRemember that you may also have to adjust your [repository settings](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).\n\nBecause this action deploys to separate, ""deploy-only"" branches, you can not use it if you want to deploy from a repo subdirectory such as `docs/`.\nIn those cases you really don\'t need a GitHub Action, because you would be committing the build artifacts yourself.\nFor details see the [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).\n\nThere are already great GitHub actions to use static site generators *and* then deploy to GitHub Pages (for [jekyll](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action), [jekyll](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages), [zola](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action) and surely many more to come).\nThis action isn\'t that, though I\'ve borrowed much of the git action from these works.\n\n**This action will not build anything, it just deploys.**\n\n## Inputs\n\nNone.\n\n\n## Outputs\n\nNone.\n\n\n## Secrets\n\nDeployment to GitHub pages happens by `git push`ing to the `gh-pages` (or `master`) branch.\nTo authorise this, the GitHub action needs a secret.\nFor now, somewhat confusingly, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` [available for every repo](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets/) *does* suffice to push to `gh-pages`, but *does not* suffice to trigger a  page build on GitHub, or even propagate the content to the GitHub content-delivery network.\n\nYou therefore **have to [create a custom Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)** much like you\'d do for external services (say, Travis). This token must be created with `repo` permissions in order to deploy to Github Pages.\nYou then have to paste this token into the GitHub UI as a secret under the name `GH_PAT` (repository settings/secrets) and call it in the action as in the below.\n\nI\'ve asked GitHub to streamline this process.\nThe discussion is documented [here](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghaction-ghpages/issues/1).\n\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nJust `BUILD_DIR`, the build directory relative to your repository root.\nYou can also pass `.` if you want to push your repository root.\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```yaml\nname: Deployment\n\n""on"":\n  - push\n  - pull_request\n\njobs:\n  deploy_ghpages:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - run: echo $GITHUB_SHA >> public/index.html\n      - uses: maxheld83/ghpages@v0.3.0\n        env:\n          BUILD_DIR: public/\n          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
175,"b'# Run-On-Arch GitHub Action\n\n[![](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action)\n\nA GitHub Action that executes commands on non-x86 CPU architecture (armv6, armv7, aarch64, s390x, ppc64le) via QEMU.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis action requires three input parameters:\n\n* `arch`: CPU architecture: `armv6`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `riscv64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`. See [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) for the full matrix.\n* `distro`: Linux distribution name: `ubuntu16.04`, `ubuntu18.04`, `ubuntu20.04`, `bullseye`, `buster`, `stretch`, `jessie`, `fedora_latest`, `alpine_latest` or `archarm_latest`. See [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) for the full matrix.\n* `run`: Shell commands to execute in the container.\n\nThe action also accepts some optional input parameters:\n\n* `githubToken`: Your GitHub token, used for caching Docker images in your project\'s public package registry. Usually this would just be `${{ github.token }}`. This speeds up subsequent builds and is highly recommended.\n* `env`: Environment variables to propagate to the container. YAML, but must begin with a `|` character. These variables will be available in both run and setup.\n* `shell`: The shell to run commands with in the container. Default: `/bin/sh` on Alpine, `/bin/bash` for other distros.\n* `dockerRunArgs`: Additional arguments to pass to `docker run`, such as volume mappings. See [`docker run` documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run).\n* `setup`: Shell commands to execute on the host before running the container, such as creating directories for volume mappings.\n* `install`: Shell commands to execute in the container as part of `docker build`, such as installing dependencies. This speeds up subsequent builds if `githubToken` is also used, but note that the image layer will be publicly available in your projects GitHub Package Registry, so make sure the resulting image does not have any secrets cached in logs or state.\n* `base_image`: Specify a custom base image, such as [busybox](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox), `arch` and `distro` should be set to `none` in this case. This will allow you to chose direcly the image that will be used in the *FROM* clause of the internal docker container without needing to create a Dockerfile.arch.distro for a specific arch/distro pair. For more detials, see [PR #103](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/pull/103#issuecomment-1363810049). Known limitation: Only one base_image configuration for each workflow if you use GitHub images caching.\n\n### Basic example\n\nA basic example that sets an output variable for use in subsequent steps:\n\n```yaml\non: [push, pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  armv7_job:\n    # The host should always be Linux\n    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\n    name: Build on ubuntu-18.04 armv7\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: uraimo/run-on-arch-action@v2\n        name: Run commands\n        id: runcmd\n        with:\n          arch: armv7\n          distro: ubuntu18.04\n\n          # Not required, but speeds up builds by storing container images in\n          # a GitHub package registry.\n          githubToken: ${{ github.token }}\n\n          # Set an output parameter `uname` for use in subsequent steps\n          run: |\n            uname -a\n            echo ::set-output name=uname::$(uname -a)\n\n      - name: Get the output\n        # Echo the `uname` output parameter from the `runcmd` step\n        run: |\n          echo ""The uname output was ${{ steps.runcmd.outputs.uname }}""\n```\n\n### Advanced example\n\nThis shows how to use a matrix to produce platform-specific artifacts, and includes example values for the optional input parameters `setup`, `shell`, `env`, and `dockerRunArgs`.\n\n```yaml\non: [push, pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  build_job:\n    # The host should always be linux\n    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\n    name: Build on ${{ matrix.distro }} ${{ matrix.arch }}\n\n    # Run steps on a matrix of 4 arch/distro combinations\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        include:\n          - arch: aarch64\n            distro: ubuntu18.04\n          - arch: ppc64le\n            distro: alpine_latest\n          - arch: s390x\n            distro: fedora_latest\n          - arch: none\n            distro: none\n            base_image: riscv64/busybox\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: uraimo/run-on-arch-action@v2\n        name: Build artifact\n        id: build\n        with:\n          arch: ${{ matrix.arch }}\n          distro: ${{ matrix.distro }}\n\n          # Not required, but speeds up builds\n          githubToken: ${{ github.token }}\n\n          # Create an artifacts directory\n          setup: |\n            mkdir -p ""${PWD}/artifacts""\n\n          # Mount the artifacts directory as /artifacts in the container\n          dockerRunArgs: |\n            --volume ""${PWD}/artifacts:/artifacts""\n\n          # Pass some environment variables to the container\n          env: | # YAML, but pipe character is necessary\n            artifact_name: git-${{ matrix.distro }}_${{ matrix.arch }}\n\n          # The shell to run commands with in the container\n          shell: /bin/sh\n\n          # Install some dependencies in the container.

The image layer is cached\n          # publicly in your project\'s package repository, so it is vital that\n          # no secrets are present in the container state or logs.\n          install: |\n            case ""${{ matrix.distro }}"" in\n              ubuntu*|jessie|stretch|buster|bullseye)\n                apt-get update -q -y\n                apt-get install -q -y git\n                ;;\n              fedora*)\n                dnf -y update\n                dnf -y install git which\n                ;;\n              alpine*)\n                apk update\n                apk add git\n                ;;\n            esac\n\n          # Produce a binary artifact and place it in the mounted volume\n          run: |\n            cp $(which git) ""/artifacts/${artifact_name}""\n            echo ""Produced artifact at /artifacts/${artifact_name}""\n\n      - name: Show the artifact\n        # Items placed in /artifacts in the container will be in\n        # ${PWD}/artifacts on the host.\n        run: |\n          ls -al ""${PWD}/artifacts""\n```\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThis table details the valid `arch`/`distro` combinations:\n\n\n| arch     | distro     |\n| -------- | ---------- |\n| armv6    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, alpine_latest |\n| armv7    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest, archarm_latest |\n| aarch64  | stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest, archarm_latest |\n| riscv64  | ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, alpine_edge |\n| s390x    | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04, ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest |\n| ppc64le  | jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, ubuntu16.04, ubuntu18.04,ubuntu20.04, ubuntu22.04, ubuntu_latest, ubuntu_rolling, ubuntu_devel, fedora_latest, alpine_latest |\n\n\nUsing an invalid `arch`/`distro` combination will fail.\n\n## Architecture emulation\n\nThis project makes use of an additional QEMU container to be able to emulate via software architectures like ARM, s390x, ppc64le, etc... that are not natively supported by GitHub. You should keep this into consideration when reasoning about the expected running time of your jobs, there will be a visible impact on performance when compared to a job executed on a vanilla runner.\n\n## Contributing\n\nNew distros and archs can be added simply by creating a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.{arch}.{distro}` (that targets an image for the desired combination) in the [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action/blob/master/Dockerfiles) directory.

178,"b'# Upload files to a GitHub release [![GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/actions)\n\nThis action allows you to select which files to upload to the just-tagged release.\nIt runs on all operating systems types offered by GitHub.\n\n## Input variables\n\nYou must provide:\n\n- `file`: A local file to be uploaded as the asset.\n\nOptional Arguments\n\n- `repo_token`: Defaults to `github.token`.\n- `tag`: The tag to upload into. If you want the current event\'s tag or branch name, use `${{ github.ref }}` (the `refs/tags/` and `refs/heads/` prefixes will be automatically stripped). Defaults to `github.ref`.\n- `asset_name`: The name the file gets as an asset on a release. Use `$tag` to include the tag name. When not provided it will default to the filename.\n                This is not used if `file_glob` is set to `true`.\n- `file_glob`: If set to true, the `file` argument can be a glob pattern (`asset_name` is ignored in this case) (Default: `false`)\n- `overwrite`: If an asset with the same name already exists, overwrite it (Default: `false`).\n- `promote`: If a prerelease already exists, promote it to a release (Default: `false`).\n- `prerelease`: Mark the release as a pre-release (Default: `false`).\n- `make_latest`: Mark the release as the latest release for the repository (Default: `true`).\n- `release_name`: Explicitly set a release name. (Defaults: implicitly same as `tag` via GitHub API).\n- `target_commit`: Sets the commit hash or branch for the tag to be based on (Default: the default branch, usually `main`).\n- `body`: Content of the release text (Default: `""""`).\n- `repo_name`: Specify the name of the GitHub repository in which the GitHub release will be created, edited, and deleted. If the repository is other than the current, it is required to create a personal access token with `repo`, `user`, `admin:repo_hook` scopes to the foreign repository and add it as a secret. (Default: current repository).\n\n## Output variables\n\n- `browser_download_url`: The publicly available URL of the asset.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis usage assumes you want to build on tag creations only.\nThis is a common use case as you will want to upload release binaries for your tags.\n\nSimple example:\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - \'*\'\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Publish binaries\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Build\n      run: cargo build --release\n    - name: Upload binaries to release\n      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2\n      with:\n        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        file: target/release/mything\n        asset_name: mything\n        tag: ${{ github.ref }}\n        overwrite: true\n        body: ""This is my release text""\n```\n\nComplex example with more operating systems:\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - \'*\'\n\njobs:\n  publish:\n    name: Publish for ${{ matrix.os }}\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        include:\n          - os: ubuntu-latest\n            artifact_name: mything\n            asset_name: mything-linux-amd64\n          - os: windows-latest\n            artifact_name: mything.exe\n            asset_name: mything-windows-amd64\n          - os: macos-latest\n            artifact_name: mything\n            asset_name: mything-macos-amd64\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Build\n      run: cargo build --release --locked\n    - name: Upload binaries to release\n      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2\n      with:\n        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        file: target/release/${{ matrix.artifact_name }}\n        asset_name: ${{ matrix.asset_name }}\n        tag: ${{ github.ref }}\n```\n\nExample with `file_glob`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - \'*\'\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Publish binaries\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Build\n      run: cargo build --release\n    - name: Upload binaries to release\n      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2\n      with:\n        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        file: target/release/my*\n        tag: ${{ github.ref }}\n        overwrite: true\n        file_glob: true\n```\n\nExample for creating a release in a foreign repository using `repo_name`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - \'*\'\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Publish binaries\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: Build\n      run: cargo build --release\n    - name: Upload binaries to release\n      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2\n      with:\n        repo_name: owner/repository-name\n        # A personal access token for the GitHub repository in which the release will be created and edited.\n        # It is recommended to create the access token with the following scopes: `repo, user, admin:repo_hook`.\n        repo_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n        file: target/release/mything\n        asset_name: mything\n        tag: ${{ github.ref }}\n        overwrite: true\n        body: ""This is my release text""\n```\n\n**Example for feeding a file from repo to the `body` tag:**\n\nThis example covers following points:\n* Reading a file present on the repo.

181,"b'# :no_entry_sign: Close All Pull Requests\n\nA GitHub action to automatically close all open pull requests.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis Action closes all the pull requests on the repo. It is useful when you don\'t want to accept any kind of pull request,\nfor instance on a readd-only repo. The action can be triggered by any event, such as `push`, `schedule` or `pull_request`\n(see below).\n\n```yaml\nname: Close All Pull Requests\n\non:\n  push:\n  pull_request:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: \'0 0 * * *\'\n\njobs:\n  run:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: crondaemon/close-pr@v1\n      with:\n        # Optional.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.""\n      env:\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n## Inputs\n\n- `comment` - *Optional*. Post an issue comment just before closing a pull request.\n\n## Events\n\nThe event to choose depends on your specific needs and configurations.\n\nThe `push` event is the most suitable if your repo gets frequent updates, both via developers push\nor via mirroring software. Each time a push happens, all the open pull requests will get closed.\nHowever if you code is pretty stable, your pull requests could stay open for a while, making this\naction useless.\n\nIn this case the most suitable event is `schedule`. You can schedule a check per hour, per day,\netc., on your choice. The drawback of this choice is that a lot of useless run will happen, with\nsome waste of resource. If you\'re taking this way, be careful to choose the right schedule that\nfits your needs.\n\nThe event `pull_request` is fired as soon as a new pull request gets opened. Despite this looks\nthe best fit, it doesn\'t work on pull requests coming from forks, for security reasons. If your\npull requests are likely to come from this way, don\'t use this configuration, or you will receive\na fail when this action runs. Moreover if a pull request gets closed, then re-opened, the event\n`pull_request` doesn\'t get fired again, leaving the PR open. A general suggestion that should fit\nthe most common needs are `push` + `schedule` (1 day).\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is released under the GPL-v2-or-later License.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

184,"b'> **Warning**\n> You probably don\'t need to install this custom action.\n> \n> Instead, use the native [concurrency](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-19-github-actions-limit-workflow-run-or-job-concurrency/) property to cancel workflows, for example:\n> ```\n> concurrency:\n>   group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}\n>   cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.ref != \'refs/heads/main\' }}\n> ```\n> Read GitHub\'s [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency) to learn more.\n\n# Cancel Workflow Action\n\nThis is a GitHub Action that will cancel any previous runs that are not `completed` for a given workflow.\n\nThis includes runs with a [status](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#check-runs) of `queued` or `in_progress`.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWhen you `git push`, this GitHub Action will capture the current Branch and SHA. It will query GitHub\'s API to find previous workflow runs that match the Branch but do not match the SHA. These in-progress runs will be canceled leaving only this run, or the [latest run](#advanced-all-but-latest).\n\nRead more about the [Workflow Runs API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#workflow-runs).\n\n## Usage\n\nTypically, you will want to add this action as the first step in a workflow so it can cancel itself on the next push.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Cancel Previous Runs\n        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n      #- name: Run Tests\n      #  uses: actions/setup-node\n      #  run: node test.js\n      # ... etc\n```\n\n### Versioning\n\nIt is recommended to pin a specific version of this action so you don\'t automatically upgrade to the latest which could introduce breaking changes.\n\n```yml\nuses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.9.1\n```\n\nNotice there is no `v` prefix, just the `@major.minor.patch` version.\n\nVisit [Releases](https://github.com/styfle/cancel-workflow-action/releases) to find the latest version at the top of the page.\n\n> **Warning**\n> \n> You might run into ""the `uses\' attribute must be a path, a Docker image, or owner/repo@ref"" error if you don\'t specify a version.\n\n### Advanced: Canceling Other Workflows\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to avoid modifying all your workflows and instead create a new workflow that cancels your other workflows. This can be useful when you have a problem with workflows getting queued.\n\n- Visit `https://api.github.com/repos/:org/:repo/actions/workflows` to find the Workflow ID(s) you wish to automaticaly cancel.\n- Add a new file `.github/workflows/cancel.yml` with the following:\n\n```yml\nname: Cancel\non: [push]\njobs:\n  cancel:\n    name: \'Cancel Previous Runs\'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    timeout-minutes: 3\n    steps:\n      - uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n        with:\n          workflow_id: 479426\n```\n\n- _Note_: `workflow_id` can be a Workflow ID (number) or Workflow File Name (string)\n- _Note_: `workflow_id` also accepts a comma separated list if you need to cancel multiple workflows\n- _Note_: `workflow_id` accepts the value `all`, which will cancel all the workflows running in the branch\n\n\n### Advanced: Pull Requests from Forks\n\nThe default GitHub token access is unable to cancel workflows for `pull_request`\nwhen a pull request is opened from a fork. Therefore, a special setup using\n`workflow_run`, which also works for `push`, is needed.\nCreate a `.github/workflows/cancel.yml` with the following instead and replace\n""CI"" with the workflow name that contains the `pull_request` workflow:\n\n```yml\nname: Cancel\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [""CI""]\n    types:\n      - requested\njobs:\n  cancel:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n      with:\n        workflow_id: ${{ github.event.workflow.id }}\n```\n\n### Advanced: Ignore SHA\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to cancel workflows when you close a Pull Request. Because this is not a push event, the SHA will be the same, so you must use the `ignore_sha` option.\n\n```yml\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [closed]\njobs:\n  cleanup:\n    name: \'Cleanup After PR Closed\'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    timeout-minutes: 3\n    steps:\n      - name: Cancel build runs\n        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n        with:\n          ignore_sha: true\n          workflow_id: 479426\n```\n\n### Advanced: All But Latest\n\nBecause this action can only cancel workflows if it is actually being run, it only helps if the pipeline isn\'t saturated and there are still runners available to schedule the workflow.\n\nBy default, this action does not cancel any workflows created after itself. The `all_but_latest` flags allows the action to cancel itself and all later-scheduled workflows, leaving only the latest.\n\n```yml\nname: Cancel\non: [push]\njobs:\n  cancel:\n    name: \'Cancel Previous Runs\'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    timeout-minutes: 3\n    steps:\n      - uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n        with:\n          all_but_latest: true\n```\n\n### Advanced: Token Permissions\n\nNo change to permissions is required by default. The instructions below are for improved control over of those permissions.\n\nBy default, GitHub creates the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Actions with some read/write permissions. It may be a good practice to switch to read-only permissions by default. Visit the [dedicated documentation page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) for details.\n\nPermissions can be set for all Jobs in a Workflow or a specific Job, see the [reference manual page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions). `cancel-workflow-action` only requires write access to the `actions` scope, so it is enough to have:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      actions: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Cancel Previous Runs\n        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action\n        with:\n          access_token: ${{ github.token }}\n```\n\n_Note_ : This is typical when global access is set to be restrictive. Only this job will elevate those permissions.\n\n## Contributing\n\n- Clone this repo\n- Run `yarn install`\n- Edit `./src/index.ts`\n- Run `yarn build`\n- Commit changes including `./dist/index.js` bundle\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

The output\npath can be modified in the `pip-wheel-args` option with the `-w` argument. Be sure to\nupload only the `*-manylinux*.whl` wheels, as the non-audited (e.g. `linux_x86_64`)\nwheels are not accepted by PyPI.\n\n### Using a different manylinux container\nThe `manylinux2014_x86_64` container is used by default. To use another manylinux\ncontainer, append `-<container-name>` to the reference.

194,"b""# Maven Publish GitHub Action\n\n**GitHub Action for automatically publishing a Maven package to the Central Repository**\n\nIt's recommended to publish using the [Digipost open super pom](https://github.com/digipost/digipost-open-super-pom/tree/master), which greatly simplifies the process.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAdd the `Digipost open super pom` to your project\n\n```xml\n<parent>\n    <groupId>no.digipost</groupId>\n    <artifactId>digipost-open-super-pom</artifactId>\n    <version>12</version>\n</parent>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Authentication\n\nIn your project's GitHub repository, go to Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Secrets. On this page, set the following variables:\n\n- `release_version`: The version you want the project to be released with\n- `sonatype_secrets`: a comma separated string that consists of `sonatype_username,sonatype_password,key_password,key_private`\n    - `sonatype_username` is your projects username at Sonatype\n    - `sonatype_password` is your projects password at Sonatype\n    - `key_password` is the password of you gpg key to sign the deployed artfacts with. \n    - `key_private` is the actual private key encoded as base64 sign the deployed artfacts with.\n\nThese secrets will be passed as environment variables into the action, allowing it to do the deployment for you.\n\n### Action\n\nCreate a GitHub workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/release.yml`) in your repository. Use the following configuration, which tells GitHub to use the Maven Publish Action when running your CI pipeline. The steps are self-explanatory:\n\n```yml\nname: Release\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n    - '*'\njobs:\n  release:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out Git repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - name: Set release version\n        run: echo ::set-env name=RELEASE_VERSION::$(echo ${GITHUB_REF:10})\n      - name: Release to Central Repository\n        uses: digipost/action-maven-publish@1.1.0\n        with:\n          sonatype_secrets: ${{ secrets.sonatype_secrets }}\n          release_version: ${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}\n          perform_release: true\n```\n\nThis should be all the configuration you need. Every time you push a tag or make a release in github, the action will be run. If your `pom.xml` file contains a non-snapshot version tag and all tests pass, your package will automatically be deployed to the Central Repository.\n\n## Development\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe Maven Publish GitHub Action works the following way:\n\n- When imported from a CI workflow in your project, GitHub will look for this repository's [`action.yml`](./action.yml) file. This file tells GitHub to run a new Docker container for the action and to pass in the action's input variables (GPG key and OSSRH login credentials).\n- Docker will spin up a new container with Java and Maven installed (see [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile)).\n- In the container, the [`entrypoint.sh`](./entrypoint.sh) script will be executed. It checks whether all required variables are defined, decodes the GPG private key and runs the Maven deploy command. Maven will use this repository's [`settings.xml`](./settings.xml) file, which instructs it to use the GPG passphrase and OSSRH credentials from the provided environment variables.\n\n\n### Release new version of action\n\nPush a tag with the new version, and also remember to replace major version tag (`v1`, `v2`, etc) to point to the latest release, which enables users to only specify the major version of the action.\n\n### Contributing\n\nSuggestions and contributions are always welcome!

196,"b'# GitHub Action - Android Emulator Runner\n\n<p align=""left"">\n  <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner""><img alt=""GitHub Actions status"" src=""https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg""></a>\n</p>\n\nA GitHub Action for installing, configuring and running hardware-accelerated Android Emulators on macOS virtual machines.\n\nThe old ARM-based emulators were slow and are no longer supported by Google. The modern Intel Atom (x86 and x86_64) emulators can be fast, but rely on two forms of hardware acceleration to reach their peak potential: [Graphics Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-graphics), e.g. `emulator -gpu host` and [Virtual Machine(VM) Acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#accel-vm), e.g. `emulator -accel on`. **Note:** GPU and VM Acceleration are two different and non-mutually exclusive forms of Hardware Acceleration.\n\nThis presents a challenge when running emulators on CI especially when running emulators within a docker container, because **Nested Virtualization** must be supported by the host VM which isn\'t the case for most cloud-based CI providers due to infrastructural limits.  If you want to learn more about Emulators on CI, here\'s an article [Yang](https://github.com/ychescale9) wrote: [Running Android Instrumented Tests on CI](https://dev.to/ychescale9/running-android-emulators-on-ci-from-bitrise-io-to-github-actions-3j76).\n\n## A note on VM Acceleration and why we don\'t need HAXM anymore\n\nAccording to [this documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration#vm-mac), ""on Mac OS X v10.10 Yosemite and higher, the Android Emulator uses the built-in [Hypervisor.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) by default, and falls back to using Intel HAXM if Hypervisor.Framework fails to initialize."" This means that **HAXM is only needed to achieve VM Acceleration if this default Hypervisor is not available on macOS machines.**\n\n**Note**: Manually enabling and downloading HAXM is not recommended because it is redundant and not needed (see above), and for users of macOS 10.13 High Sierra and higher: macOS 10.13 [disables installation of kernel extensions by default](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017658). Because Intel HAXM is a kernel extension, we would need to manually enable its installation on the base runner VM. Furthermore, manually trying to install HAXM on a Github Runner [brings up a popup](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/discussions/286#discussioncomment-4026120) which further hinders tests from running.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis action helps automate and configure the process of setting up an emulator and running your tests by doing the following:\n\n- Install / update the required **Android SDK** components including `build-tools`, `platform-tools`, `platform` (for the required API level), `emulator` and `system-images` (for the required API level).\n- Create a new instance of **AVD** with the provided [configurations](#configurations).\n- Launch a new Emulator with the provided [configurations](#configurations).\n- Wait until the Emulator is booted and ready for use.\n- Run a custom script provided by user once the Emulator is up and running - e.g. `./gradlew connectedCheck`.\n- Kill the Emulator and finish the action.\n\n## Usage & Examples\n\nA workflow that uses **android-emulator-runner** to run your instrumented tests on **API 29**:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: 29\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nWe can also leverage GitHub Actions\'s build matrix to test across multiple configurations:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        api-level: [21, 23, 29]\n        target: [default, google_apis]\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          target: ${{ matrix.target }}\n          arch: x86_64\n          profile: Nexus 6\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nIf you need specific versions of **NDK** and **CMake** installed:\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: 29\n          ndk: 21.0.6113669\n          cmake: 3.10.2.4988404\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\nWe can significantly reduce emulator startup time by setting up AVD snapshot caching:\n\n1. add a `gradle/gradle-build-action@v2` step for caching Gradle, more details see [#229](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/229)\n2. add an `actions/cache@v3` step for caching the `avd`\n3. add a `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to generate a clean snapshot - specify `emulator-options` without `no-snapshot`\n4. add another `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` step to run your tests using existing AVD / snapshot - specify `emulator-options` with `no-snapshot-save`\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        api-level: [21, 23, 29]\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Gradle cache\n        uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2\n        \n      - name: AVD cache\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        id: avd-cache\n        with:\n          path: |\n            ~/.android/avd/*\n            ~/.android/adb*\n          key: avd-${{ matrix.api-level }}\n\n      - name: create AVD and generate snapshot for caching\n        if: steps.avd-cache.outputs.cache-hit != \'true\'\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          force-avd-creation: false\n          emulator-options: -no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -noaudio -no-boot-anim -camera-back none\n          disable-animations: false\n          script: echo ""Generated AVD snapshot for caching.""\n\n      - name: run tests\n        uses: reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2\n        with:\n          api-level: ${{ matrix.api-level }}\n          force-avd-creation: false\n          emulator-options: -no-snapshot-save -no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -noaudio -no-boot-anim -camera-back none\n          disable-animations: true\n          script: ./gradlew connectedCheck\n```\n\n## Configurations\n\n| **Input** | **Required** | **Default** | **Description** |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| `api-level` | Required | N/A | API level of the platform system image - e.g. 23 for Android Marshmallow, 29 for Android 10. **Minimum API level supported is 15**. |\n| `target` | Optional | `default` | Target of the system image - `default`, `google_apis`, `playstore`, `android-wear`, `android-wear-cn`, `android-tv`, `google-tv`, `aosp_atd` or `google_atd`.

You can get it running much faster on self-hosted Linux runners but only if the underlying instances support KVM (which most don\'t). Things might be better on the newer Larger runners but they are still in Beta. It is possible to use this Action with hardware accelerated Linux VMs hosted by a third-party runner provider.\n\nFor a longer answer please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/android-emulator-runner/issues/46).\n\n## Who is using Android Emulator Runner?\n\nThese are some of the open-source projects using (or used) **Android Emulator Runner**:\n\n- [coil-kt/coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [cashapp/sqldelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [square/workflow-kotlin](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [square/retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/.github/workflows)\n- [natario1/CameraView](https://github.com/natario1/CameraView/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [natario1/Transcoder](https://github.com/natario1/Transcoder/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [chrisbanes/insetter](https://github.com/chrisbanes/insetter/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [slackhq/keeper](https://github.com/slackhq/keeper/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [android/compose-samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [ReactiveCircus/streamlined](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/streamlined/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [ReactiveCircus/FlowBinding](https://github.com/ReactiveCircus/FlowBinding/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [JakeWharton/RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example](https://github.com/vinaygaba/Learn-Jetpack-Compose-By-Example/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [ashishb/adb-enhanced](https://github.com/ashishb/adb-enhanced/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [vgaidarji/ci-matters](https://github.com/vgaidarji/ci-matters/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yaml)\n- [simpledotorg/simple-android](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-android/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [cashapp/copper](https://github.com/cashapp/copper/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/build.yaml)\n- [square/radiography](https://github.com/square/radiography/blob/main/.github/workflows/android.yml)\n- [Shopify/android-testify](https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/blob/master/.github/workflows/sample_build.yml)\n- [square/leakcanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/tree/main/.github/workflows)\n- [hash-checker/hash-checker](https://github.com/hash-checker/hash-checker/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [hash-checker/hash-checker-lite](https://github.com/hash-checker/hash-checker-lite/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [Kiwix/kiwix-android](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/develop/.github/workflows)\n- [wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia](https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia/blob/main/.github/workflows)\n- [google/android-fhir](https://github.com/google/android-fhir/tree/master/.github/workflows)\n- [google/accompanist](https://github.com/google/accompanist/blob/main/.github/workflows)\n- [dotanuki-labs/norris](https://github.com/dotanuki-labs/norris/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)\n- [tinylog-org/tinylog](https://github.com/tinylog-org/tinylog/blob/v3.0/.github/workflows/build.yaml)\n- [hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project/blob/development/.github/workflows/sormas_app_ci.yml)\n- [ACRA/acra](https://github.com/ACRA/acra/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)\n- [bitfireAT/davx5-ose](https://github.com/bitfireAT/davx5-ose/blob/dev-ose/.github/workflows/test-dev.yml)\n\nIf you are using **Android Emulator Runner** and want your project included in the list, please feel free to open a pull request.\n'","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
197,"b""# GitHub Action - Publish Gem to Rubygems\n\nThis is a GitHub Action written to streamline the Ruby gem publication process. The action sets the Gem Credentials using `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` secret and then runs `rake release` in your project root. You can override this command by setting `RELEASE_COMMAND` environment variable to the script that creates and publishes (this is usually only the case when a repository hosts multiple gems together).\n\n# Secrets Needed\n\n`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` - The Rubygems API Key for an Owner of the Gem you wish to publish. You can find your API Key by looking in `~/.gem/credentials` or using the [Rubygems API](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#misc-methods).\n\n# Environment Variables\n\n`RELEASE_COMMAND` - By default, this will invoke `rake release` to build and publish the gem to Rubygems. Set this environment variable if you have a custom release command to be invoked.\n\n`WORKDIR` - Sets the workdir where bundle and the release will be run\n\n`GIT_EMAIL`/`GIT_NAME` - A git identity you wish the tags to by published by.\n\n# Example\n\n```yml\nname: CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps: (your tests go here)\n\n  publish:\n    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    needs: build\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Release Gem\n        uses: discourse/publish-rubygems-action@v2\n        env:\n          RUBYGEMS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RUBYGEMS_API_KEY }}\n          RELEASE_COMMAND: rake release\n          GIT_EMAIL: ci@example.com\n          GIT_NAME: Your CI\n```\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)
198,"b'# A Repo Tagging GitHub Action\n\nThis GitHub Action creates a [lightweight tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) for the repository using head of the repository. Note that if the repo is already tagged with the version then no attempt is made to tag the repo and nothing happens.\n\nIt is expected that you compute the version in another step of yout workflow. Below are some example shell commands that you can use to determine the version.\n\n\n## Getting the tag from a file\n\nSome languages allow you (or require you) to set the version in some config file. I\'ve included some example `main.yaml`s.\n\n### Python\n\nFor `python` in `poetry` managed projects you can do something like the following:\n```yaml\nname: Tagging main using pyproject.toml\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Tag main using pyproject.toml\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout main\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n    - name: The new tag\n      id: computed-tag\n      run: |\n        set -e\n        TAG=$(cat pyproject.toml \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp ""^version ="" \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching ""[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+.[0-9]+[-\\.\\+a-zA-Z0-9]*"" \\\n          | head --lines=1)\n        echo ""tag=v$TAG"" >> ""$GITHUB_OUTPUT""\n    - name: Tag main depending on the value in pyproject.toml\n      uses: djordon/git-autotag-action@v0.7.0-beta1\n      with:\n        tag: ${{ steps.computed-tag.outputs.tag }}\n```\n\n### Rust\n\nFor `rust`, you can do something like the following:\n```yaml\n...\n    - name: The new tag\n      id: computed-tag\n      run: |\n        set -e\n        TAG=$(cat Cargo.toml \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp ""^version ="" \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching ""[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+.[0-9]+[-\\.\\+a-zA-Z0-9]*"" \\\n          | head --lines=1)\n        echo ""tag=v$TAG"" >> ""$GITHUB_OUTPUT""\n    - name: Tagging repo using version specified in Cargo.toml\n      uses: djordon/git-autotag-action@v0.7.0-beta1\n      with:\n        tag: ${{ steps.computed-tag.outputs.tag }}\n```\n\n\n### Elixir\n\nFor `elixir`, the `yaml` below can be used to read the version defined in `mix.exs` (assuming the `version` key is on it\'s own line in the `project` section of `mix.exs`):\n```yaml\n...\n    - name: The new tag\n      id: computed-tag\n      run: |\n        set -e\n        TAG=$(cat mix.exs \\\n          | grep --line-buffer ""version: "" \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching ""\\""[-0-9\\.\\+a-zA-Z]+\\"""" \\\n          | grep --extended-regexp --only-matching ""[-0-9\\.\\+a-zA-Z]+"")\n        echo ""tag=v$TAG"" >> ""$GITHUB_OUTPUT""\n    - name: Tagging repo using version specified in mix.exs\n      uses: djordon/git-autotag-action@v0.7.0-beta1\n      with:\n        tag: ${{ steps.computed-tag.outputs.tag }}\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Strongly recommended to set this var if using anything else than master or main as default branch otherwise in combination with history full will error.\n- **WITH_V** _(optional)_ - Tag version with `v` character.\n- **RELEASE_BRANCHES** _(optional)_ - Comma separated list of branches (bash reg exp accepted) that will generate the release tags. Other branches and pull-requests generate versions postfixed with the commit hash and do not generate any tag. Examples: `master` or `.*` or `release.*,hotfix.*,master` ...\n- **CUSTOM_TAG** _(optional)_ - Set a custom tag, useful when generating tag based on f.ex FROM image in a docker image. **Setting this tag will invalidate any other settings set!**\n- **SOURCE** _(optional)_ - Operate on a relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.\n- **DRY_RUN** _(optional)_ - Determine the next version without tagging the branch. The workflow can use the outputs `new_tag` and `tag` in subsequent steps. Possible values are `true` and `false` (default).\n- **GIT_API_TAGGING** _(optional)_ - Set if using git cli or git api calls for tag push operations. Possible values are `false` and `true` (default).\n- **INITIAL_VERSION** _(optional)_ - Set initial version before bump. Default `0.0.0`. MAKE SURE NOT TO USE vX.X.X here if combined WITH_V\n- **TAG_CONTEXT** _(optional)_ - Set the context of the previous tag. Possible values are `repo` (default) or `branch`.\n- **PRERELEASE** _(optional)_ - Define if workflow runs in prerelease mode, `false` by default. Note this will be overwritten if using complex suffix release branches. Use it with checkout `ref: ${{ github.sha }}` for consistency see [issue 266](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action/issues/266).\n- **PRERELEASE_SUFFIX** _(optional)_ - Suffix for your prerelease versions, `beta` by default. Note this will only be used if a prerelease branch.\n- **VERBOSE** _(optional)_ - Print git logs. For some projects these logs may be very large. Possible values are `true` (default) and `false`.\n- **MAJOR_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#major` commit message string tag.\n- **MINOR_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#minor` commit message string tag.\n- **PATCH_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#patch` commit message string tag.\n- **NONE_STRING_TOKEN** _(optional)_ - Change the default `#none` commit message string tag.\n- **BRANCH_HISTORY** _(optional)_ - Set the history of the branch for finding `#bumps`. Possible values `last`, `full` and `compare` defaults to `compare`.\n  - `full`: attempt to show all history, does not work on rebase and squash due missing HEAD [should be deprecated in v2 is breaking many workflows]\n  - `last`: show the single last commit\n  - `compare`: show all commits since previous repo tag number\n\n### Outputs\n\n- **new_tag** - The value of the newly created tag.\n- **tag** - The value of the latest tag after running this action.\n- **part** - The part of version which was bumped.\n\n> **_Note:_** This action creates a [lightweight tag](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#create-a-reference).\n\n### Bumping\n\n**Manual Bumping:** Any commit message that includes `#major`, `#minor`, `#patch`, or `#none` will trigger the respective version bump. If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.\nIf `#none` is contained in the merge commit message, it will skip bumping regardless `DEFAULT_BUMP`.\n\n**Automatic Bumping:** If no `#major`, `#minor` or `#patch` tag is contained in the merge commit message, it will bump whichever `DEFAULT_BUMP` is set to (which is `minor` by default). Disable this by setting `DEFAULT_BUMP` to `none`.\n\n> **_Note:_** This action **will not** bump the tag if the `HEAD` commit has already been tagged.\n\n### Workflow\n\n- Add this action to your repo\n- Commit some changes\n- Either push to master or open a PR\n- On push (or merge), the action will:\n  - Get latest tag\n  - Bump tag with minor version unless the merge commit message contains `#major` or `#patch`\n  - Pushes tag to github\n  - If triggered on your repo\'s default branch (`master` or `main` if unchanged), the bump version will be a release tag. see [issue 266](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action/issues/266).\n  - If triggered on any other branch, a prerelease will be generated, depending on the bump, starting with `*-<PRERELEASE_SUFFIX>.1`, `*-<PRERELEASE_SUFFIX>.2`, ...\n  - To create a repository release you need another workflow like [automatic-releases](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-releases).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Credits\n\n- [fsaintjacques/semver-tool](https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool)\n- [Contributors to this project](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Projects using github-tag-action\n\nExamples of projects using github-tag-action for reference.\n\n- another/github-tag-action (uses itself to create tags)\n- [anothrNick/json-tree-service](https://github.com/anothrNick/json-tree-service)\n\n  > Access JSON structure with HTTP path parameters as keys/indices to the JSON.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Merge your Pull Request and enjoy lighter images or explore what\xe2\x80\x99s possible further with [configuration options](#configuration). \xf0\x9f\x91\x87\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\r\n\r\n## \xe2\x9a\x99\xef\xb8\x8f Configuration\r\n\r\nBy default, Image Actions will compress images so that they\xe2\x80\x99re smaller and will leave your assets looking clear and crisp. If you want to change or expand those defaults, read on for available options.\r\n\r\n:warning: If you are using an older version of Image Actions referencing `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml`, we suggest you [migrate to the latest configuration format](#migrate-legacy-configuration).\r\n\r\n### Control image quality settings\r\n\r\nAdd the following arguments to the workflow definition to control compression settings:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nwith:\r\n  jpegQuality: \'80\'\r\n  jpegProgressive: false\r\n  pngQuality: \'80\'\r\n  webpQuality: \'80\'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Options:**\r\n\r\n- [jpegQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r\n- [jpegProgressive](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg): Boolean, true or false, default false.\r\n- [pngQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r\n- [webpQuality](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp): Number, integer 1-100, default 80 stored in a string.\r\n\r\n### Ignore paths\r\n\r\nAdd the following argument to the workflow definition to ignore selected paths:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nwith:\r\n  ignorePaths: \'node_modules/**,build\'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ignorePaths` accepts a comma-separated string with [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) support of paths to ignore when looking for images to compress.\r\n\r\n### Run compression only\r\n\r\nBy default, Image Actions adds optimised images to the current Pull Request and posts a summary comment.\r\n\r\nUse the `compressOnly` option with `true` value to skip the commit and summary comment if you want to handle this separately (including for forks):\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nwith:\r\n  compressOnly: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n`compressOnly` accepts a Boolean value (true or false) and defaults to false.\r\n\r\n### Compress on demand or on schedule\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to run Image Actions [on demand](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) or on a [recurring schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule). By using the `compressOnly` option, in conjunction with [`create-pull-request`](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) action by [@peter-evans](https://github.com/peter-evans), a new Pull Request will be raised if there are optimised images in a repository.\r\n\r\nSee an example below:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# Compress images on demand (workflow_dispatch), and at 11pm every Sunday (schedule).\r\n# Open a Pull Request if any images can be compressed.\r\nname: Compress Images\r\non:\r\n  workflow_dispatch:\r\n  schedule:\r\n    - cron: \'00 23 * * 0\'\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    name: calibreapp/image-actions\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout Repo\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n      - name: Compress Images\r\n        id: calibre\r\n        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@main\r\n        with:\r\n          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n          compressOnly: true\r\n      - name: Create New Pull Request If Needed\r\n        if: steps.calibre.outputs.markdown != \'\'\r\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4\r\n        with:\r\n          title: Compressed Images Nightly\r\n          branch-suffix: timestamp\r\n          commit-message: Compressed Images\r\n          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Process Pull Requests from forked repositories\r\n\r\nBy default, GitHub Actions do not have permission to alter forked repositories. For this reason, Image Actions only works for Pull Requests from branches in the same repository as the destination branch. There are several workarounds for this limitation:\r\n\r\n1. **Replace the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token) which does have permission to access forked repositories.** Be aware that this introduces potential security concerns (which is why it not available by default).\r\n\r\n2. **Run Image Actions only for Pull Requests in the current repository.** This approach is advised when not using Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to avoid wasting time and compute for compressions that will not be committed. Use the following configuration to check if a Pull Request belongs to the repository:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nif: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. **Run an additional instance of Image Actions in `compressOnly` mode on pushes to `main`, and then raise a new Pull Request for any images committed without being compressed (e.g. from a forked repository PR).** See the configuration in the below example which uses the [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) action by [@peter-evans](https://github.com/peter-evans) to open the new Pull Request (this only raises a Pull Request if any files are changed in previous steps).\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nname: Compress Images on Push to main branch\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - main\r\n    paths:\r\n      - \'**.jpg\'\r\n      - \'**.jpeg\'\r\n      - \'**.png\'\r\n      - \'**.webp\'\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    name: calibreapp/image-actions\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout Repo\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n      - name: Compress Images\r\n        id: calibre\r\n        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@main\r\n        with:\r\n          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n          compressOnly: true\r\n      - name: Create New Pull Request If Needed\r\n        if: steps.calibre.outputs.markdown != \'\'\r\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4\r\n        with:\r\n          title: Compressed Images\r\n          branch-suffix: timestamp\r\n          commit-message: Compressed Images\r\n          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Combined workflow\r\n\r\nYou can combine all of the above customisation options into one all-encompassing workflow to avoid having to set up separate workflows with a lot of duplication.\r\n\r\nThe example below ensures the right order of task execution within Image Actions. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to reuse it, make sure to change `example/example_repo` to your repository details.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# Image Actions will run in the following scenarios:\r\n# - on Pull Requests containing images (not including forks)\r\n# - on pushing of images to `main` (for forks)\r\n# - on demand (https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/)\r\n# - at 11 PM every Sunday in anything gets missed with any of the above scenarios\r\n# For Pull Requests, the images are added to the PR.\r\n# For other scenarios, a new PR will be opened if any images are compressed.\r\nname: Compress images\r\non:\r\n  pull_request:\r\n    paths:\r\n      - \'**.jpg\'\r\n      - \'**.jpeg\'\r\n      - \'**.png\'\r\n      - \'**.webp\'\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - main\r\n    paths:\r\n      - \'**.jpg\'\r\n      - \'**.jpeg\'\r\n      - \'**.png\'\r\n      - \'**.webp\'\r\n  workflow_dispatch:\r\n  schedule:\r\n    - cron: \'00 23 * * 0\'\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    name: calibreapp/image-actions\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    # Only run on main repo on and PRs that match the main repo.\r\n    if: |\r\n      github.repository == \'example/example_repo\' &&\r\n      (github.event_name != \'pull_request\' ||\r\n       github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository)\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout Branch\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n      - name: Compress Images\r\n        id: calibre\r\n        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@main\r\n        with:\r\n          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n          # For non-Pull Requests, run in compressOnly mode and we\'ll PR after.\r\n          compressOnly: ${{ github.event_name != \'pull_request\' }}\r\n      - name: Create Pull Request\r\n        # If it\'s not a Pull Request then commit any changes as a new PR.\r\n        if: |\r\n          github.event_name != \'pull_request\' &&\r\n          steps.calibre.outputs.markdown != \'\'\r\n        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4\r\n        with:\r\n          title: Auto Compress Images\r\n          branch-suffix: timestamp\r\n          commit-message: Compress Images\r\n          body: ${{ steps.calibre.outputs.markdown }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \xe2\x99\xbb\xef\xb8\x8f Migrating legacy configuration\r\n\r\nIf you are using an older version of Image Actions, we recommend checking that your settings are up-to-date.\r\n\r\n### Uses and `GITHUB_TOKEN` definition\r\n\r\nIf your `calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file has a reference to `docker://` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` as follows:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: calibreapp/image-actions\r\n    uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions\r\n    env:\r\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate your configuration to:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n- name: Compress Images\r\n  uses: calibreapp/image-actions@main\r\n  with:\r\n    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Location and name of the configuration file\r\n\r\nIf your repository uses `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` for configuration, it should be moved into `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml`.

The user can customize the behavior by setting the environment variable `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` *before* vcpkg runs.\n  - set the workflow variables `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` and `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` to let users easily running vcpkg\n  in a `run` step such as `- run: vcpkg install` or `- run: vcpkg integrate install` without forcing the \n  users to set the variables manually.\n  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. Customizable by the user by setting the input `logCollectionRegExps`.\n  - automatic parsing of `CMake`, `vcpkg` and `gcc`, `clang`, `msvc` errors, reporting them contextually in the workflow summary by means of annotations.\n  - although disabled by default (see input `doNotCache`), `run-vcpkg` can cache vcpkg\'s executable and data files to speed up subsequent workflow runs. Since bootstrapping `vcpkg` already downloads a prebuilt binary saving the time to build `vcpkg`, \n  this form of caching is useful only when the prebuilt executable is not served as it happens for the ARM platform.\n  Note this cache does not contain the libraries built by vcpkg, which is instead managed by vcpkg itself.\n\nThe provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).\n\nGood companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action and the\n[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) actions.\n\n<br>\n\n## Quickstart with instructions\n\nIt is __highly recommended__ to use:\n- [vcpkg as a submodule](#use-vcpkg-as-a-submodule-of-your-repository).\n- a [vcpkg.json](#use-vcpkgs-vcpkgjson-file-to-specify-the-dependencies) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.\n- a `CMakePresets.json` file.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    steps:\n      #-uses: actions/cache@v1   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!\n\n      # Install latest CMake.\n      - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest\n      # Or pin to a specific CMake version:\n      # lukka/get-cmake@v3.21.2\n\n      # Setup vcpkg: ensures vcpkg is downloaded and built.\n      # Since vcpkg.json is being used later on to install the packages\n      # when `run-cmake` runs, no packages are installed at this time \n      # (and vcpkg does not run).\n      - name: Setup vcpkg (it does not install any package yet)\n        uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v11\n        #with:\n          # This is the default location of the directory containing vcpkg sources.\n          # Change it to the right location if needed.\n          # vcpkgDirectory: \'${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg\'\n\n          # If not using a submodule for vcpkg sources, this specifies which commit\n          # id must be checkout from a Git repo. \n          # Note: it must not be set if using a Git submodule for vcpkg.\n          # vcpkgGitCommitId: \'${{ matrix.vcpkgCommitId }}\'\n\n          # This is the glob expression used to locate the vcpkg.json. \n          # Change it to match a single manifest file you want to use.\n          # Note: do not use `${{ github.context }}` to compose the value as it\n          # contains backslashes that would be misinterpreted.

this way the version of `vcpkg` used is implied by the commit id specified by the submodule for `vcpkg`.\n\n### Use vcpkg\'s vcpkg.json file to specify the dependencies\n\nThe [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) is a manifest file that declaratively specifies the dependencies to be installed.\nThe file is being used automatically by running CMake (e.g. by using [run-cmake](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake)) when:\n - starting CMake with the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file.\n - the root CMake source directory contains a [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) file.\n\nOr it can also be used by invoking `vcpkg install` in a directory where `vcpkg.json` is located (e.g., input `runVcpkgInstall : true`).\n\nWhen conditions are satisfied, the toolchain execution starts [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages declared in the manifest file.\n\n **Putting this manifest-like file under source control is highly recommended as this helps to run vcpkg the same exact way locally and remotely on the build servers.**\nThe dependencies specified in the vcpkg.json file are installed when CMake runs (i.e. at `run-cmake` execution time).\n\n## Samples\n\n_Checkmarks_ indicates whether the samples ""uses"" or specifies the thing in the header or whether it is true.\n\n| workflow link                                                                                                              | `vcpkg` as submodule | explicit triplet | `vcpkg` toolchain | `CMake`\'s Presets | `Ninja` | `run-vcpkg` runs vcpkg | `CMake` runs `vcpkg` |\n| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :-----: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |\n| [link](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/v10/.github/workflows/hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod.yml)         |          \xe2\x9c\x85           |        \xe2\x9d\x8c         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |    \xe2\x9c\x85    |           \xe2\x9d\x8c            |          \xe2\x9c\x85           |\n| [link](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/v10/.github/workflows/hosted-ninja-vcpkg.yml)                |          \xe2\x9d\x8c           |        \xe2\x9d\x8c         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |    \xe2\x9c\x85    |           \xe2\x9d\x8c            |          \xe2\x9c\x85           |\n| [link](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/v10/.github/workflows/hosted-ninja-vcpkg-install.yml)        |          \xe2\x9d\x8c           |        \xe2\x9d\x8c         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |    \xe2\x9c\x85    |           \xe2\x9c\x85            |          \xe2\x9d\x8c           |\n| [link](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/v10/.github/workflows/hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod-triplet.yml) |          \xe2\x9c\x85           |        \xe2\x9c\x85         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |         \xe2\x9c\x85         |    \xe2\x9c\x85    |           \xe2\x9d\x8c            |          \xe2\x9c\x85           |\n\n<br>\n\n## Who is using `run-vcpkg`\n\n[This graph](https://lukka.github.io/graph/graph.html) shows the list of public repositories with more than 25 stars using `run-vcpkg`.\n\n<br>\n\n# License\n\nAll the content in this repository is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019-2020-2021-2022-2023 Luca Cappa\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe software is provided as is, there is no warranty of any kind.

212,"b'# Github Action Build Chain\n\nGithub action build chain is a tool for github actions to build multiple projects from different repositories in a single action.\nThis tool is trying to solve the problem when a project depends on another project (most probably from the same organization) and one change can/should be performed in different repositories. How can we assure one specific pull request will work with the latest changes from/in the dependant/dependency projects and it won\'t break something? This is what we call **cross-repo pull requests** and **build-chain** is the way we have to solve it.\n\nLet\'s consider you have a project hierarchy like:\n\n![Project hierarchy](/docs/project-hierarchy.png)\n\nand you want to upstream/downstream build whatever project from this hierarchy, **Github Action Build Chain** provides you the mechanism to easily do it.\nYou can check [Usage example](#usage-example).\n\nJust defining the **build chain** flow in every project you want to trigger, the tool will get build information from `dependency-file` input and will execute every command from every project in a single github action.\n\nTable of content\n----------------\n\n* **[Github Action Build Chain](#github-action-build-chain)**\n* **[Build Chain Flows](#build-chain-flows)**\n* **[How to add it to your project(s)](#how-to-add-it-to-your-projects)**\n* **[Input Fields](#input-fields)**\n* **[Pre/Post sections](#prepost-sections)**\n* **[Archiving Artifacts](#archiving-artifacts)**\n* **[How to clone project in more than one folder](#how-to-clone-project-in-more-than-one-folder)**\n* **[Execution environment](#execution-environment)**\n* **[Usage example](#usage-example)**\n* **[Local Execution](#local-execution)**\n* **[About Commands to Execute](#about-commands-to-execute)**\n* **[v2 to v3](#v2-to-v3)**\n  * **[Using multiple git platforms](#using-multiple-git-platforms)**\n  * **[Found a regression?](#found-a-regression)**\n* **[Limitations](#limitations)**\n* **[Development](#development)**\n* **[System Requirements](#system-requirements)**\n\n\n## Allowed configuration files versions\n\n- 2.1\n- 2.2\n\n## Build Chain Flows\n\n### Cross Pull request flow\n\n- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.\n\n  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.\n    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.\n\n- It recursively checks out the rest of the dependant projects defined in `definition-file`.\n\n  - For each parent dependency:\n    - It will look for forked project belonging same github group as the one triggering the job.\n    - It will try to checkout SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH. In case the it exists and it has a pull request over the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH it will check it out and will merge it with target branch.\n    - If previous checkout fails, it will try the same with TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH this time.\n    - If previous checkout fails, it will checkout TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH.\n      > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.\n\n- Once all the projects are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section for every parent dependency starting from the highest level of the hierarchy to the lowest one.\n\n- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.\n\n### Full Downstream flow\n\n- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.\n\n  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.\n    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.\n\n- It gets the full downstream project chain (the parents projects plus its children and their dependencies. At the end the whole chain) based on configuration file.\n- It recursively checks out the rest of the dependant projects defined in `definition-file`.\n\n  - For each parent dependency:\n    - It will look for forked project belonging same github group as the one triggering the job.\n    - It will try to checkout SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH. In case the it exists and it has a pull request over the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH it will check it out and will merge it with target branch.\n    - If previous checkout fails, it will try the same with TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH this time.\n    - If previous checkout fails, it will checkout TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH.\n      > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.\n\n- Once all the projects are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section for every parent dependency starting from the highest level of the hierarchy to the lowest one.\n\n- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.\n\n### Single Pull Request flow\n\n- It checks out the current project and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.\n\n  - It merges the TARGET_GROUP:PROJECT:TARGET_BRANCH into the SOURCE_GROUP:PROJECT:SOURCE_BRANCH from the pull request triggering the job.\n    > **_Warning:_** It will fail in case it can\'t be done automatically, properly informing to please resolve conflicts.\n\n- Once the project from the event is checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section.\n\n- It will archive artifacts in case `archive-artifacts-path` input is defined.\n\n### Branch flow\n\n- It checks out the whole tree from the `starting-project` project input and reads the workflow information from the YAML file triggering the job.\n\n- Once the projects from the branch are checked out, it will run as many commands are defined in `before`, `after` or root level properties from `build` section.\n\n- The flow will archive (in case the archiving is not skipped) a spreadsheet with the execution summary.\n\n## How to add it to your project(s)\n\nIt is just to add the step (replacing dependencies and commands):\n\n```\n- name: Build Chain ${{ matrix.java-version }}\n  id: build-chain\n  uses: ginxo/github-action-build-chain@BXMSPROD-1025\n  with:\n    definition-file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${GROUP}/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/${BRANCH}/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml\n  env:\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n```\n\nto your existing yaml flow definition or to create a new one. Do the same for the rest of the projects you need.\n\n> **_Note:_** The `@actions/checkout` step is not needed since is the tool the one which is going to handle what to checkout for every project in the chain.\n\n## Input Fields\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n- **definition-file** (mandatory): `path to the file in filesystem | URL to the file`. [See more details](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader#url-format)\n\n  > Example:\n  >\n  > ```\n  > definition-file: \'./folder/whatever_definition_file.yaml\'\n  > definition-file: \'http://yourdomain.com/definition-file.yaml\'\n  > definition-file: \'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/main/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml\'\n  > definition-file: \'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/${BRANCH}/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml\'\n  > definition-file: \'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${GROUP}/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/${BRANCH}/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml\'\n  > definition-file: \'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${GROUP}/${PROJECT_NAME}/${BRANCH}/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml\'\n  > ```\n\n> **_Note:_** In case you use URL way, remember you should point the file content itself, so in case you want to use https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/a1efb55f17fd0fd9001b073c999e3fd2a80600a6/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml, `definition-file` value should be https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/a1efb55f17fd0fd9001b073c999e3fd2a80600a6/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml (Raw one for this case) or (using dynamic placeholders) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${GROUP}/${PROJECT_NAME}/${BRANCH}/.ci/pull-request-config.yaml.\n\n- **flow-type** (optional. \'cross_pr\' by default): The flow you want to execute. Possible values\n\n  - cross_pr: executes the cross pull request flow\n  - full_downstream: executes the full downstream flow\n  - branch: executes the branch flow\n  - single_pr: executes the single pull request flow\n\n- **starting-project** (optional. the project triggering the job by default): The project you want start building from. The project to construct the tree from. It\'s not the same as the project triggering the job which is taken from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env variable or the github pull request event payload. For instance\n\n  > ```\n  > starting-project: \'groupX/projectX\' // it will get project dependencies tree from \'groupX/projectX\'\n  > starting-project: \'kiegroup/drools\' // it will get project dependencies tree from \'kiegroup/drools\'\n  > ```\n\n  > **_Note:_** You have to be sure the project tree to start building from, contains the project triggering the job.\n\n- **logger-level** (optional. \'info\' by default): The log level. Possible values\n\n  - info\n  - trace\n  - debug\n\n  > ```\n  > logger-level: \'info\'\n  > logger-level: \'debug\'\n  > ```\n\n- **annotations-prefix** (optional. \'\' by default): The prefix to be shown on the Github Actions\' Annotations title.\n\n  > ```\n  > annotations-prefix: ""${{ matrix.java-version }}/${{ matrix.maven-version }}""\n  > annotations-prefix: ""My Job Prefix""\n  > annotations-prefix: ""Gradle Version ${{ matrix.gradle-version }}""\n  > annotations-prefix: ""OS ${{ matrix.os }}""\n  > ```\n\n- **enable-parallel-execution** (optional. false by default): By enabling parallel execution, build-chain will try to detect projects that can be executed parallely without any conflicts i.e. no 2 projects where 1 depends on another will be executed parallely.\n\n- **additional-flags** (optional. \'\' by default): The chance to define additional flags for the execution, as it is done on the CLI side. Just semicolon (;) separated, like \'--skipParallelCheckout;--skipExecution;-t (mvn .\\*)||\\$1 -s settings.xml\'.\n\n  > ```\n  > additional-flags: ""--fullProjectDependencyTree""\n  > additional-flags: ""--fullProjectDependencyTree;--skipParallelCheckout""\n  > additional-flags: ""--skipParallelCheckout; --fullProjectDependencyTree""\n  > additional-flags: ""--skipParallelCheckout; -t (mvn .*)||$1 -s settings.xml""\n  > ```\n\n  > **_Note:_** It has a limitation, the flag values can\'t contain semicolons (;), otherwise it will be treated as a new flag.\n\n## Pre/Post sections\n\nIt is possible to define pre and post sections in the definition-file. The idea is to have the chance to execute something before (`pre`) or after (`post`) project checkout and build command execution.\n\n### PRE\n\n```\npre: string | multiline string\n```\n\nIt will be executed even before checking out projects.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\npre: export VARIABLE_NAME=value\n```\n\n```\npre: |\n  export VARIABLE_NAME=value\n  echo $VARIABLE_NAME\n```\n\n### POST\n\n```\npost:\n  success: string | multiline string\n  failure: string | multiline string\n  always: string | multiline string\n```\n\nIt will be executed after executing all commands for every project and after archiving artifacts. The options are:\n\n- `success`: it will be executed in case there\'s no error during build execution.\n- `failure`: it will be executed in case there\'s any error during build execution.\n- `always`: it will be always executed.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\npost:\n  success: echo \'final message in case of no errors\'\n  failure: echo \'final message in case of any error\'\n  always: echo \'final message always printed\'\n```\n\n```\npost:\n  success: |\n    echo \'final message in case of no errors 1\'\n    echo \'final message in case of no errors 2\'\n  failure: |\n    echo \'final message in case of any error\'\n    echo \'final message in case of any error 2\'\n  always: |\n    echo \'final message always printed\'\n    echo \'final message always printed 2\'\n```\n\n## Archiving Artifacts\n\nThe archive artifacts algorithm is basically copied from [actions/upload-artifact project](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) and (manually) transpiled to javascript. The usage is basically the same (the inputs are different named adding `archive-artifacts` prefix and the [Conditional Artifact Upload](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#conditional-artifact-upload) is not enabled), so why do we include this `archive artifacts` mechanism in this tool if it\'s already implemented by another tool? well, because this treats the archive artifacts mechanism for the whole build chain, so in case you define an `archive-artifacts-path` in a different project from the chain, all of them will be uploaded. If you are wondering if you are able to use `actions/upload-artifact` instead of the one we propose, the answer is \'yes\', just take into consideration the artifacts will be archived based on the definition from the project triggering the job.\n\nThe `archive-artifacts-path` input brings you the chance to specify if the path will be uploaded in case of build success (default), in case of failure or always for every single path. For example specifying something like `path/to/artifact/world.txt@failure` will archive `path/to/artifact/world.txt` in case of execution failure. You can check [Upload for different execution results](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#upload-for-different-execution-results).\n\n### Upload an Individual File\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: **/dashbuilder-runtime.war\n```\n\n### Upload an Entire Directory\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: path/to/artifact-folder/\n```\n\n### Upload using a Wildcard Pattern\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: path/**/[abc]rtifac?/*\n```\n\n### Upload using Multiple Paths and Exclusions\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: |\n    path/output/bin/\n    path/output/test-results\n    !path/**/*.tmp\n```\n\n### Upload for different execution results\n\nThis is something additional to [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob)\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: |\n    path/output/bin/\n    path2/output2/bin2/@success\n    path/output/test-results@failure\n    !path/**/*.tmp@always\n```\n\n- will upload `path/output/bin/` just in case of `success`\n- will upload `path2/output2/bin2/` just in case of `success`\n- will upload `path/output/test-results` just in case of `failure`\n- will upload `!path/**/*.tmp` in every case\n\n### Path Wildcards\n\nFor supported wildcards along with behavior and documentation, see [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) which is used internally to search for files.\n\nIf a wildcard pattern is used, the path hierarchy will be preserved after the first wildcard pattern.\n\n```\n    path/to/*/directory/foo?.txt =>\n        \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/some/directory/foo1.txt\n        \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/some/directory/foo2.txt\n        \xe2\x88\x9f path/to/other/directory/foo1.txt\n\n    would be flattened and uploaded as =>\n        \xe2\x88\x9f some/directory/foo1.txt\n        \xe2\x88\x9f some/directory/foo2.txt\n        \xe2\x88\x9f other/directory/foo1.txt\n```\n\nIf multiple paths are provided as input, the least common ancestor of all the search paths will be used as the root directory of the artifact. Exclude paths do not effect the directory structure.\n\nRelative and absolute file paths are both allowed. Relative paths are rooted against the current working directory. Paths that begin with a wildcard character should be quoted to avoid being interpreted as YAML aliases.\n\nThe [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) package is used internally to handle most of the logic around uploading an artifact. There is extra documentation around upload limitations and behavior in the toolkit repository that is worth checking out.\n\n### Customization if no files are found\n\nIf a path (or paths), result in no files being found for the artifact, the action will succeed but print out a warning. In certain scenarios it may be desirable to fail the action or suppress the warning. The `if-no-files-found` option allows you to customize the behavior of the action if no files are found.\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: path/to/artifact/\n  if-no-files-found: error # \'warn\' or \'ignore\' are also available, defaults to `warn`\n```\n\n### Conditional Artifact Upload\n\nnot supported (yet)\n\n### Uploading without artifact name\n\nYou can upload an artifact with or without specifying a name\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  name: my-artifacts\n  path: **/dashbuilder-runtime.war\n```\n\nIf not provided, `artifact` will be used as the default name which will manifest itself in the UI after upload.\n\n### Uploading to the same artifact\n\nEach artifact behaves as a file share. Uploading to the same artifact multiple times in the same workflow can overwrite and append already uploaded files\n\n```yaml\n# Project A\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: world.txt\n```\n\n```yaml\n# Project B\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: extra-file.txt\n```\n\n```yaml\n# Project C\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: world.txt\n```\n\nWith the following example, the available artifact (named `artifact` which is the default if no name is provided) would contain both `world.txt` and `extra-file.txt`.\n\n### Environment Variables and Tilde Expansion\n\nYou can use `~` in the path input as a substitute for `$HOME`. Basic tilde expansion is supported.\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: ""~/new/**/*""\n```\n\n### archive-artifacts dependencies usage\n\nThe `dependencies` field allows us to define a set of projects for which we want to upload the artifacts.\n\n- `none` only artifacts from the starting project will be uploaded\n- `all` artifacts from all projects will be uploaded\n- `list of projects` artifacts from only a given list of projects will be uploaded\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: ""~/new/**/*""\n  dependencies: ""none""\n```\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: ""~/new/**/*""\n  dependencies: ""all""\n```\n\n```yaml\narchive-artifacts:\n  path: ""~/new/**/*""\n  dependencies: |\n    projectX\n    projectY\n```\n\n## Where does the upload go?\n\nIn the top right corner of a workflow run, once the run is over, if you used this action, there will be a `Artifacts` dropdown which you can download items from. Here\'s a screenshot of what it looks like<br/>\n<img src=""docs/archive-artifacts-github.png"" width=""375"" height=""140"">\n\nThere is a trashcan icon that can be used to delete the artifact. This icon will only appear for users who have write permissions to the repository.\n\n## How to clone project in more than one folder\n\nIt is possible to clone project in more than one folder specifying `clone` field. For example:\n\n```\n  - project: kiegroup/appformer\n    clone:\n      - appformer-integration-test\n      - folderx/appformer-unit-test\n```\n\nwill clone the `kiegroup/appformer` in the `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER` and additionally will clone the project folder to `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/appformer-integration-test` and `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/folderx/appformer-unit-test`\n\nAnother example would be:\n\n```\n  - project: group/projectx\n    clone: another-folder\n```\n\nwill clone the `group/projectx` in the `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER` and additionally will clone the project folder to `ROOT_FOLDER/PROJECT_FOLDER/another-folder`\n\n\n## Execution environment\n\nThe environment execution definition is part of the workflow (the `.yml` file) and it depends on the commands you require to execute. If you require to execute maven commands you will have to add the `actions/setup-java@v1` with its java version, or in case you need python commands `actions/setup-python` is the one. You can find different examples in https://github.com/YOURGROUP/YOURPROJECT/actions/new.\n\nIt could be the case where you require a very specific environment to execute your stuff as it is the case for [python3-cekit](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/tree/python3-cekit). Feel free to propose the environment you need as a pull request to this project:\n\n- Create a branch based on `python3-cekit` one\n- Modify [the Dockerfile from there](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/blob/python3-cekit/Dockerfile)\n\nCurrent environments:\n\n- **python3-cekit**: python3 + python cekit library + docker + nodejs + yarn latest stable release [Dockerfile](https://github.com/kiegroup/github-action-build-chain/blob/python3-cekit/Dockerfile)\n\n## Usage example\n\nConsidering the projects hierarchy:\n\n![Project hierarchy](/docs/project-hierarchy.png)\n\nYou can check how to define build definition files from [Build Chain Configuration Reader documentation](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader)\n\n### Mapping\n\nLet\'s suppose\n\n```\n- project: E\n  dependencies:\n    - project: D\n  mapping:\n    dependencies:\n      default:\n        - source: 7.x\n          target: main\n      C:\n        - source: main\n          target: 7.x\n        - source: 7.x\n          target: 7.x\n      D:\n        - source: main\n          target: 7.x\n        - source: 7.x\n          target: 7.x\n    dependant:\n      default:\n        - source: main\n          target: 7.x\n    exclude:\n      - A\n      - B\n```\n\n#### mapping.dependencies\n\nIt is used to define branch mapping between E and its dependencies in case `E` is `projectTriggeringTheJob`.\n\nIn case the `E:7.x` branch build or PR is triggered for this `7.x` target branch:\n\n- A: no mapping at all, so `7.x` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)\n- B: no mapping at all, so `7.x` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)\n- C:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `7.x` mapping)\n- D:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.D` source `7.x` mapping)\n- The rest (F,G,H,...): `main` (since `mapping.dependencies.default` mapping defined for source: `7.x`)\n\nIn case the `E:main` branch build or PR is triggered for this `main` target branch:\n\n- A: no mapping at all, so `main` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)\n- B: no mapping at all, so `main` (straight mapping) (since it is excluded)\n- C:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `main` mapping)\n- D:`7.x` (due to `mapping.dependencies.C` source `main` mapping)\n- The rest (F,G,H,...): `main` (since there\'s no mapping defined for default main branch)\n\nIn case the `E:anyotherbranch` branch build or PR is triggered for this `anyotherbranch` target branch (being `anyotherbranch` whatever the branch name, except `7.x` or `main`):\n\n- No mapping at all, just straight mapping to `anyotherbranch`.\n\n#### mapping.dependant\n\nIt is used to define branch mapping between the rest of the projects and project A in case `E` is NOT `projectTriggeringTheJob`.\n\nIn case the `A:7.x` or any other (except `main`) branch build or PR is triggered -> `E:7.x` will be taken (since there\'s not `mapping.dependant` for `7.x` source)\nIn case the `A:main` branch build or PR is triggered -> `E:7.x` (due to `mapping.dependant.default` mapping)\n\n## Docker build\n\nYou can build the `github-action-build-chain` image locally with just executing docker command:\n\n```\ndocker build .\n```\n\nIn case you want to build it for a different openjdk version you just specify a `--build-arg OPENJDK_VERSION` argument:\n\n```\ndocker build --build-arg OPENJDK_VERSION=11 .\n```\n\n## Local execution\n\nIt\'s possible to use this tool locally, just follow this steps\n\n```\n$ npm install -g @kie/build-chain-action\n$ build-chain help\nUsage: build-chain [options] [command]\n\nA CLI tool to perform the build chain github actions\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help      display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  build           Execute different flows\n  tools           A bunch of utility tools\n  help [command]  display help for command\n```\n\neither `sudo` and `env GITHUB_TOKEN=...` are optional depending on your local setup.\n\n> Keep in mind: Whenever the tool is executed from a github check run, the `Printing local execution command` section is printed with the exact command you could copy/paste in order to reproduce it locally.\n\n### build command\n\nThe build command is used to execute the different flows locally\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain build help\nUsage: build-chain build [options] [command]\n\nExecute different flows\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help                 display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  cross_pr [options]         Execute cross pull request build chain workflow\n  full_downstream [options]  Execute full downstream build chain workflow\n  single_pr [options]        Execute single pull request build chain workflow\n  branch [options]           Execute branch build chain workflow\n  help [command]             display help for command\n```\n\n### build command: cross_pr\n\nExecute pull-request flow\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain build cross_pr --help\nUsage: build-chain build cross_pr [options]\n\nExecute cross pull request build chain workflow\n\nOptions:\n  -u, --url <event_url>                  pull request event url\n  -p, --startProject <project>           The project to start the build from\n  -f, --defintionFile <path_or_url>      The definition file, either a path to the filesystem or a URL to it\n  -o, --outputFolder <path>              The folder path to store projects.

It can be set as an environment variable instead. You can specify multiple tokens\n  -d, --debug                            Set debugging mode to true (default: false)\n  --skipExecution                        A flag to skip execution and artifacts archiving for all projects.

When running any other `build-chain build` commands, it will produce a state file in the current working directory which will store all the data related to its execution. If you run `build-chain build resume` in the same working directory, then `build-chain` will pick up that state file, reconstruct `build-chain build`\'s previous state and continue execution from the first point of failure. Note that the tokens are not stored in the state file, so you have to pass them again to the `resume` command using the `--token` option or setting them as env variables.\n\nTo run from the current working directory\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain build resume\n```\n\nTo run from a specific workspace\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain build resume -w bc\n```\n\n#### Custom Command Replacement\n\nIt is possible to define custom expression to replace commands. The expression structure is `RegEx||ReplacementEx` where:\n\n- `RegEx`: you can define regular expression with or without literals. See [Javascript RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)\n- `||` just split `RegEx` from `ReplacementEx`\n- `ReplacementEx`: See [Javascript String replacement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)\n\nSo basically at left side of `||` you define the regular expression where you want to apply string replacement from right side. For example, considering command `mvn clean install` in case we apply `(^mvn .*)||$1 -s ~/.m2/settings.xml` the final command will be `mvn clean install -s ~/.m2/settings.xml`\n\n### tool command\n\nThere are some utility tools as well\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain tools help\nUsage: build-chain tools [options] [command]\n\nA bunch of utility tools\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help              display help for command\n\nCommands:\n  project-list [options]  Prints the projects that will be built given a starting project ordered by precedence\n  plan                    Execute build chain without actually cloning or executing projects (like a dry run)\n  resume [options]        Resume execution from first point of failure\n  help [command]          display help for command\n```  \n\n### tool command: plan\n\nThe `plan` command lets you execute build-chain without actually cloning or executing projects, like a dry run. This lets you verify whether build-chain will clone the correct projects, will checkout the correct branch, will merge the correct PRs and will execute the correct commands for each project. To use this command you simply have to pass the arguments that come after `build-chain build` command to `build-chain tools plan` command. For example:\n\nIf you want to see the dry run for the following `build` command:\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain build cross_pr -f definition_file -u event_url\n```\n\nthen, you have to run the following `plan` command:\n\n```shell\n$ build-chain tools plan cross_pr -f definition_file -u event_url\n```\n\n## About Commands to Execute\n\nJust consider the library used behind the scenes in order to execute commands is [@actions/exec](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/exec), this library has a limitation at https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/b5f31bb5a25d129441c294fc81ba7f92f3e978ba/packages/exec/src/exec.ts#L27 where it tries to decide the ""tool"" to be executed, so in case you need to execute bash or windows commands like conditionals you should use it like this\n\n### Bash\n`bash -c ""my command""`\n`bash -c  ""if true; then echo \'it\'s TRUE\'; else echo \'it\'s FALSE\'; fi""`\n\n### Windows\n`cmd /c ""my command""`\n\n> **_Note:_** thanks to https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/461#issuecomment-743750804\n\n# v2 to v3\n\nList of breaking changes from v2 to v3:\n\n- v2 flow types are deprecated but still supported. Since they are deprecated they might be removed in future releases. Acceptable v3 flowtypes which are consistent across CLI and github action are:\n  - cross_pr (know as pr or pull-request in v2)\n  - full_downstream (know as fd or fdb in v2)\n  - single_pr (know as single in v2)\n  - branch\n- v3 now accepts definition file version 2.2\n- CLI options that have changed:\n  - v2: `-df` to v3: `-f`\n  - v2: `-url` to v3: `-u` or `--url`\n  - v2: `-folder` to v3: `-o`\n  - v2: `-cct` to v3: `-t`\n  - v2: `-spc` to v3: `--skipProjectCheckout`\n  - v2: `-sp` to v3: `-p`\n- Project naming convention while checking out a project is now - `OWNER_PROJECT-NAME`. For example if we have `owner/some-name` the project will be checked out as `owner_some-name`. In v2 this would have been checked out as `owner_some_name`\n\n## Using multiple git platforms\n\nYou can now define multiple git platforms to clone your projects from. Currently only GitHub, GitLab and Gerrit are supported. Refer to [build-chain-configuration-reader](#https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader#platforms-only-in-version-23) on how to define multiple platforms. The advanatge of having this is that you can build projects that are hosted on one platform along with projects that are hosted on another platform.\n\nbuild-chain runs with a default platform configured. This default platform is used for projects which don\'t have a platform defined and for reading and loading configuration from the definition file.\n\nBy default, when you run build-chain as a github action the default platform configuration used is GitHub.  \n\nWhen using build-chain as a CLI tool, build-chain will try to detect the default platform based on the definition file url. If it is not able to detect it from the url, it will use GitHub as the default configuration. If you want to override all of this, you will have the option to define default configuration as CLI options (currently only GitHub and GitLab have default options):\n\n```shell\n-ghi, --defaultGithubId <id>                default github id\n-ghti, --defaultGithubTokenId <token id>    default github token id used to get token from env\n-gha, --defaultGithubApiUrl <api url>       default github api url to use\n-ghs, --defaultGithubServeUrl <server url>  default github server url to use\n-gli, --defaultGitlabId <id>                default gitlab id\n-glti, --defaultGitlabTokenId <token id>    default gitlab token id used to get token from env\n-gla, --defaultGitlabApiUrl <api url>       default gitlab api url to use\n-gls, --defaultGitlabServeUrl <server url>  default gitlab server url to use\n```\n\n### Multiple git platforms example\n\n```\nversion: 2.3\n\ndependencies:\n  - project: middleware/build-configurations\n    platform: rh-gitlab\n    mapping:\n      dependencies:\n        default:\n          - source: master\n            target: main\n      dependant:\n        default:\n          - source: main\n            target: master\n  - project: business-automation/eng-jenkins-scripts\n    platform: rh-gerrit\n    dependencies:\n      - project: middleware/build-configurations\n      - project: kiegroup/drools\n  \n  - project: kiegroup/drools\n    platform: github-public\n\ndefault:\n  build-command:\n    current: echo ""default current""\n\nbuild:\n  - project: business-automation/eng-jenkins-scripts\n    build-command:\n      current: echo ""business-automation/eng-jenkins-scripts""\n\nplatforms:\n  - id: rh-gitlab\n    type: gitlab\n    tokenId: RH_GITLAB_TOKEN\n    serverUrl: https://gitlab.xxxx.com\n    apiUrl: https://gitlab.xxxx.com/api/v4\n\n  - id: rh-gerrit\n    type: gerrit\n    tokenId: RH_GERRIT_TOKEN\n    serverUrl: https://gerrit.xxxx.com\n    apiUrl: https://gerrit.xxxx.com/r/a\n```\n\n> **_Note:_** it is possible to specify as many github/gitlab/gerrit platforms as it is required\n> **_Note:_** use `github-public`, `gitlab-public` and/or `gerrit-public` identifiers for `https://github.com`, `https://gitlab.com` and/or `https://gerrit.googlesource.com` respectively, no need to define them.\n> **_Note:_** use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` and/or `GERRIT_TOKEN` token for default github/gitlab/gerrit services.\n\n\n## Found a regression?  \n\nWe have a built a dynamic agonistic end to end regression testing suite to avoid breaking major features that were working in previous versions. Its dynamic since all the test cases are determined by a json file that anyone can update without knowing the details about the implementation. It is agnostic since it just cares about the final executable that is produced and is not implementation specific.\n\nIf you found a regression please add it to the test.json file is the below format:\n\n- For cli regression tests each test case is defined in [test/e2e-regression/cli/test.json](test/e2e-regression/cli/tests.json) in the format:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: string; // name of the test case. typically you can name it corresponding to the issue\n  cmd: string; // the build-chain cli command used to reproduce the issue\n  description?: string; // further description of the issue\n  env?: Record<string, string>; // any env setup needed\n  shouldFail?: boolean; // whether the expected result after execution of build-chain is success or failure. by default it expects success\n  matchOutput?: string[] // any particular strings to match in the output\n  dontMatchOutput?: string[] // any particular strings we want to make sure aren\'t there in the output\n}\n```\n\n- For action regression tests each test case is defined in [test/e2e-regression/github-action/test.json](test/e2e-regression/github-action/test.json) in the format:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: string; // name of the test case. typically you can name it corresponding to the issue\n  event: string | PullRequestPayload; // it can either be a link to a PR or a JSON object similar to a pull request event payload\n  description?: string; // further description of the issue\n  env?: Record<string, string>; // any env setup needed\n  shouldFail?: boolean; // whether the expected result after execution of build-chain is success or failure. by default it expects success\n  matchOutput?: string[] // any particular strings to match in the output\n  dontMatchOutput?: string[] // any particular strings we want to make sure aren\'t there in the output\n  \n  // it accepts all the inputs that are needed to run build-chain as a github action\n  ""definition-file"": string;\n  ""flow-type"": string;\n  ""starting-project?"": string;\n  ""skip-execution""?: string;\n  ""skip-project-execution""?: string;\n  ""skip-checkout""?: string;\n  ""skip-project-checkout""?: string;\n  ""skip-parallel-checkout""?: string;\n  ""custom-command-treatment""?: string;\n  ""additional-flags""?: string;\n  ""logger-level""?: string;\n  ""annotations-prefix""?: string;\n}\n```\n# Limitations\n\n### Zipped Artifact Downloads\n\nDuring a workflow run, files are uploaded and downloaded individually using the `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` actions. However, when a workflow run finishes and an artifact is downloaded from either the UI or through the [download api](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/artifacts/#download-an-artifact), a zip is dynamically created with all the file contents that were uploaded. There is currently no way to download artifacts after a workflow run finishes in a format other than a zip or to download artifact contents individually. One of the consequences of this limitation is that if a zip is uploaded during a workflow run and then downloaded from the UI, there will be a double zip created.\n\n### Permission Loss\n\n:exclamation: File permissions are not maintained during artifact upload :exclamation: For example, if you make a file executable using `chmod` and then upload that file, post-download the file is no longer guaranteed to be set as an executable.\n\n### Case Insensitive Uploads\n\n:exclamation: File uploads are case insensitive :exclamation: If you upload `A.txt` and `a.txt` with the same root path, only a single file will be saved and available during download.\n\n## Github limitations\n\n### Using secrets on a forked project Github Action\n\nAccording to documentation, see [Workflows in forked repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories)\n\n> **_Note:_** With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository. The GITHUB_TOKEN has read-only permissions in forked repositories.\n\nNothing but `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret can be used from a forked project Github Action workflow. So cases like this will store nothing on `${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD_BAD }}`, `${{ env.CIFS_ZID_USER }}` or `${{ env.CIFS_ZID_KEY }}` but it will properly store `GITHUB_TOKEN` on `${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD}}`\n\n```\n      - name: ""Run build-chain""\n        id: build-chain\n        uses: kiegroup/github-action-build-chain@main\n        with:\n          definition-file: whatever-the-file-url/path\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD_BAD: ""${{ secrets.MY_GH_TOKEN }}""\n          GITHUB_TOKEN_GOOD: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""\n          CIFS_ZID_USER: ""${{ secrets.CIFS_ZID_USER }}""\n          CIFS_ZID_KEY: ""${{ secrets.CIFS_ZID_KEY }}""\n```\n\n> **_Note:_** Just remember this is not a problem from the tool itself but a limitation from Github Actions in order to avoid exposing sensitive information.\n\n### inputs usage in runs.image from action.yml\n\n> Just in case you are interested in adapting this code or in case you want to create your own tool.\n\nIt\'s not possible to use expressions like `image: ""docker://kie-group:github-action-build-chain:{{ inputs.build-chain-build-system }}""`. This way it would be easy to dynamically select image to run with a simple `with` input from flow yml file and we could skip errors like [matrix in uses](#matrix-in-uses).\nJust because of this we have to maintain different Dockerfile definitions in different branches and to tag every branch for every version we release like `python3-cekit-v1`.\n\n## Development\n\n### Execute CLI\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run build:cli\n./build/index.js build ...\n```\n\n### build-chain-configuration-reader dependency\n\nThe definition files are read thanks to [build-chain-configuration-reader](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-configuration-reader) library so in case you want to modify something from there it\'s easier if you just [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it:\n\n- clone repository and browse to the folder\n- `npm install` it\n- (`sudo`) `npm link`\n- and then from this project folder execute `npm link @kie/build-chain-configuration-reader`  \n\n### Multi token usage with the help of octokit throttling  \n\nTo avoid rate limiting errors, users can pass in multiple tokens that octokit can use while making Github API calls.The idea is that when octokit gets a rate limit error for one token it will use another token from the pool and retry the same request.  \n\nTo implement this we used features and plugins from octokit itself. Using the [octokit throttling plugin](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-throttling.js), we attached hooks that are triggered whenever octokit gets a rate limit error. This hook switches out the current token with a new token from a whitelist pool of tokens (these tokens haven\'t reached their rate limit) and sets that token as the current token. The token which had reached its rate limit is then added to a blacklist where we keep track of after what time that token can become usable. Each time when this hook is triggered we also check whether a token from the blacklist is now available or not. If it is then we add it back to the whitelist for future use.\n\nNow since we have a dynamically changing current token, we had to create a custom auth strategy for octokit. This auth strategy also installs a hook which is triggered each time octokit makes a request. So before each request, this hook adds the current token to the authorization header.\n\n### Testing\n\n#### unit tests\nTo test your changes you can run\n```\nnpm test\n```\nAnd to test with coverage report you can run\n```\nnpm run test:report\n```\n#### e2e tests\n\nTo run e2e tests you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once you have setup docker you can run\n```\nnpm run test:e2e\n```\nTo generate log files containing the raw output of the worflows executed during e2e tests you can run\n```\nACT_LOG=true npm run test:e2e\n```\n\n# System Requirements\n\n* **Git** >=2.28\n* **NodeJS** >= 14\n\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Downloads from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).\n- Registering problem matchers for error output.\n\nThe action is based on [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) and is using the [AdoptOpenJDK API](https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/) for fetching the JDK binaries.\n\n# Usage\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml)\n\n## Basic\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: joschi/setup-jdk@v2\n  with:\n    java-version: \'11\' # The OpenJDK version to make available on the path\n    architecture: \'x64\' # defaults to \'x64\'\n- run: java -cp java HelloWorldApp\n```\n\nExamples of version specifications that the java-version parameter will accept:\n\n- A major Java version\n\n  e.g. ```6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...```\n\n## Local file\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n- uses: joschi/setup-jdk@v2\n  with:\n    java-version: \'4.0.0\'\n    architecture: x64\n    jdkFile: <path to jdkFile> # Optional - jdkFile to install java from.

If you have an existing `settings.xml` file at that location, it will be overwritten. See below for using the `settings-path` to change your `settings.xml` file location.***\n\nIf you don\'t want to overwrite the `settings.xml` file, you can set `overwrite-settings: false`.\n\nIf `gpg-private-key` input is provided, the private key will be written to a file in the runner\'s temp directory, the private key file will be imported into the GPG keychain, and then the file will be promptly removed before proceeding with the rest of the setup process. A cleanup step will remove the imported private key from the GPG keychain after the job completes regardless of the job status. This ensures that the private key is no longer accessible on self-hosted runners and cannot ""leak"" between jobs (hosted runners are always clean instances).\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package) for more information on the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Publishing using Gradle\n```yaml\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up JDK 1.8\n      uses: joschi/setup-jdk@v2\n\n    - name: Build with Gradle\n      run: gradle build\n\n    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages\n      run: gradle publish\n      env:\n        USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}\n        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n***NOTE: The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` need to correspond to the credentials environment variables used in the publishing section of your `build.gradle`.***\n\nSee the help docs on [Publishing a Package with Gradle](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#example-using-gradle-groovy-for-a-single-package-in-a-repository) for more information on the `build.gradle` configuration file.\n\n## Apache Maven with a settings path\n\nWhen using an Actions self-hosted runner with multiple shared runners the default `$HOME` directory can be shared by a number runners at the same time which could overwrite existing settings file.

215,"b'# auto-label-merge-conflicts\n> A Github action to auto-label PRs with merge conflicts\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis action checks all open Pull Requests for merge conflicts and marks them with a Github label. \n\n![Github action in action](./demo.png)\n\nOnce a conflict is resolved the label is automatically removed.\n\nThe typical use case is to run this action post merge (e.g. push to `master`) to quickly see which other PRs are now in conflict.\n \nWe use this setup e.g. on our monorepo at [Comtravo](https://github.com/comtravo). Instead of a grumpy CTO pinging developers to fix their merge conflicts there\'s now a shiny bot.\n\n## Set up\n\nTo configure the action on your repo you have to do 2 things:\n\n1) pick a Github label that should be used to mark PRs with conflicts\n This label will then be managed by this action. It will be added to PRs with merge conflicts and removed from PRs without conflicts.\n \n2) configure the new workflow by creating a YML config file in your `.github/workflows` folder:\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\njobs:\n  triage:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: mschilde/auto-label-merge-conflicts@master\n        with:\n          CONFLICT_LABEL_NAME: ""has conflicts""\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          MAX_RETRIES: 5\n          WAIT_MS: 5000\n```\n\nThe label from step 1 should be referenced in the parameter `CONFLICT_LABEL_NAME`\n\nTake a look at [this repo](https://github.com/mschilde/auto-label-merge-conflicts/blob/master/%2Egithub/workflows/label_merge_conflicts.yml) for an example setup.\n\n### Arguments:\n\n* `CONFLICT_LABEL_NAME`: label used for marking conflicts, note that such label has to exist in your repo\n* `MAX_RETRIES`: optional (default 5)\n* `WAIT_MS`: optional (default 5000)\n\n## Limitations\n\nGithub does not reliably compute the `mergeable` status which is used by this action to detect merge conflicts. \n\nIf `master` changes the mergeable status is unknown until someone (most likely this action) requests it. [Github then tries to compute the status with an async job.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30620973) \n\nThis is usually quick and simple, but there are no guarantees and Github might have issues.\nYou can tweak `MAX_RETRIES` and `WAIT_MS` to increase the timeout before giving up on a Pull Request.\n\n## Local dev setup\n\nTo play around with the code base, you need `Docker` and `make` set up locally.\n\nRun `make build`, `make develop`, then `yarn install`.\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with a role using GitHub\'s OIDC provider and your desired region.\n\n```yaml\n      - name: Configure AWS credentials\n        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n        with:\n          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-github-actions-role\n          aws-region: us-east-1\n\n      - name: Login to Amazon ECR Private\n        id: login-ecr\n        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1\n```\n\nWe recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) when using AWS services in GitHub Actions workflows, including:\n* [Assume an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-workloads-use-roles) to receive temporary credentials. See the [Sample IAM Role CloudFormation Template](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#sample-iam-role-cloudformation-template) in the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action to get an example.\n* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.\n* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#remove-credentials) of the IAM role used in GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n### Docker Credentials\nThe registry URIs for ECR Private and ECR Public are as follows:\n- Registry URI for ECR Private: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.aws-region-1.amazonaws.com`\n- Registry URI for ECR Public: `public.ecr.aws`\n\nAfter logging in, you can access the docker username and password via action outputs using the following format:\n\nIf using ECR Private:\n- Docker username output: `docker_username_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`\n- Docker password output: `docker_password_123456789012_dkr_ecr_aws_region_1_amazonaws_com`\n\nIf using ECR Public:\n- Docker username output: `docker_username_public_ecr_aws`\n- Docker password output: `docker_password_public_ecr_aws`\n\nTo push Helm charts, you can also login through Docker. By default, Helm can authenticate with the same credentials that you use for Docker.\n\n## Self-Hosted Runners\n\n### Proxy Configuration\n\nIf you run in self-hosted environments and/or in secured environments where you need to use a specific proxy, you can set it in the action manually.\n\nAdditionally, this action will always consider an already configured proxy in the environment.\n\nProxy configured via action input:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1.6.0\nwith:\n  http-proxy: ""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n````\n\nProxy configured via an environment variable:\n```shell\n# Your environment configuration\nHTTP_PROXY=""http://companydomain.com:3128""\n```\n\nThe action will read the underlying proxy configuration from the environment, and you don\'t need to configure it in the action.\n\n## Permissions\n\n### ECR Private\n\nTo see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).\n\nThis action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Private:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Sid"": ""GetAuthorizationToken"",\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [\n        ""ecr:GetAuthorizationToken""\n      ],\n      ""Resource"": ""*""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nDocker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker pull` and `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action.\n\nThe following minimum permissions are required for pulling an image from an ECR Private repository:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Sid"": ""AllowPull"",\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [\n        ""ecr:BatchGetImage"",\n        ""ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer""\n      ],\n      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-ecr-repo""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following minimum permissions are required for pushing and pulling images in an ECR Private repository:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Sid"": ""AllowPushPull"",\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [\n        ""ecr:BatchGetImage"",\n        ""ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"",\n        ""ecr:CompleteLayerUpload"",\n        ""ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"",\n        ""ecr:InitiateLayerUpload"",\n        ""ecr:PutImage"",\n        ""ecr:UploadLayerPart""\n      ],\n      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-ecr-repo""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### ECR Public\n\nTo see how and where to implement the permissions below, see the [IAM section in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/security-iam.html).\n\n\nThis action requires the following minimum set of permissions to login to ECR Public:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Sid"": ""GetAuthorizationToken"",\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [\n        ""ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken"",\n        ""sts:GetServiceBearerToken""\n      ],\n      ""Resource"": ""*""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nDocker commands in your GitHub Actions workflow, like `docker push`, may require additional permissions attached to the credentials used by this action. There are no permissions needed for pulling images from ECR Public.\n\nThe following minimum permissions are required for pushing an image to an ECR Public repository:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",\n  ""Statement"": [\n    {\n      ""Sid"": ""AllowPush"",\n      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",\n      ""Action"": [\n        ""ecr-public:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"",\n        ""ecr-public:CompleteLayerUpload"",\n        ""ecr-public:InitiateLayerUpload"",\n        ""ecr-public:PutImage"",\n        ""ecr-public:UploadLayerPart""\n      ],\n      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:ecr-public::123456789012:repository/my-ecr-public-repo""\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Configure credentials\n\n`Inaccessible host: \'api.ecr-public.aws-region-1.amazonaws.com\' at port \'undefined\'. This service may not be available in the \'aws-region-1\' region.`\n\n- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as a region where ECR Public isn\'t available.\n- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.\n\n`GetAuthorizationToken command is only supported in us-east-1.`\n\n- The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is configured as `us-west-2`.\n- ECR Public can only be logged into from the `us-east-1` region. In the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action, the `aws-region` input must be `us-east-1`.\n\n### Inputs\n\n`Invalid parameter at \'registryIds\' failed to satisfy constraint: \'Member must satisfy constraint: [Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: [0-9]{12}]\'`\n\n- One of the registries you provided in the `registries` input isn\'t a sequence of 12 digits\n- For users providing only a single registry ID in the `registries` input, if the ID begins with a 0, make sure to enclose it in quotes. GitHub Actions will read an input as a number if all of the characters in the input are digits. So if your registry ID begins with a 0, the 0 will be truncated.

218,"b'## Amazon ECS ""Deploy Task Definition"" Action for GitHub Actions\n\nRegisters an Amazon ECS task definition and deploys it to an ECS service.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n<!-- toc -->\n\n- [Usage](#usage)\n    + [Task definition file](#task-definition-file)\n    + [Task definition container image values](#task-definition-container-image-values)\n- [Credentials and Region](#credentials-and-region)\n- [Permissions](#permissions)\n- [AWS CodeDeploy Support](#aws-codedeploy-support)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [License Summary](#license-summary)\n- [Security Disclosures](#security-disclosures)\n\n<!-- tocstop -->\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS\n      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1\n      with:\n        task-definition: task-definition.json\n        service: my-service\n        cluster: my-cluster\n        wait-for-service-stability: true\n```\n\nSee [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action\'s inputs and outputs.\n\n### Task definition file\n\nIt is highly recommended to treat the task definition ""as code"" by checking it into your git repository as a JSON file.  Changes to any task definition attributes like container images, environment variables, CPU, and memory can be deployed with this GitHub action by editing your task definition file and pushing a new git commit.\n\nAn existing task definition can be downloaded to a JSON file with the following command.  Account IDs can be removed from the file by removing the `taskDefinitionArn` attribute, and updating the `executionRoleArn` and `taskRoleArn` attribute values to contain role names instead of role ARNs.\n```sh\naws ecs describe-task-definition \\\n   --task-definition my-task-definition-family \\\n   --query taskDefinition > task-definition.json\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can start a new task definition file from scratch with the following command.  In the generated file, fill in your attribute values and remove any attributes not needed for your application.\n```sh\naws ecs register-task-definition \\\n   --generate-cli-skeleton > task-definition.json\n```\n\nIf you do not wish to store your task definition as a file in your git repository, your GitHub Actions workflow can download the existing task definition.\n```yaml\n    - name: Download task definition\n      run: |\n        aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition my-task-definition-family --query taskDefinition > task-definition.json\n```\n\n### Task definition container image values\n\nIt is highly recommended that each time your GitHub Actions workflow runs and builds a new container image for deployment, a new container image ID is generated.  For example, use the commit ID as the new image\'s tag, instead of updating the \'latest\' tag with the new image.  Using a unique container image ID for each deployment allows rolling back to a previous container image.\n\nThe task definition file can be updated prior to deployment with the new container image ID using [the `aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition).  The following example builds a new container image tagged with the commit ID, inserts the new image ID as the image for the `my-container` container in the task definition file, and then deploys the rendered task definition file to ECS:\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n      with:\n        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n\n    - name: Login to Amazon ECR\n      id: login-ecr\n      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1\n\n    - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR\n      id: build-image\n      env:\n        ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}\n        ECR_REPOSITORY: my-ecr-repo\n        IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}\n      run: |\n        docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .\n        docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG\n        echo ""image=$ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n    - name: Fill in the new image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition\n      id: task-def\n      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1\n      with:\n        task-definition: task-definition.json\n        container-name: my-container\n        image: ${{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}\n\n    - name: Deploy Amazon ECS task definition\n      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1\n      with:\n        task-definition: ${{ steps.task-def.outputs.task-definition }}\n        service: my-service\n        cluster: my-cluster\n        wait-for-service-stability: true\n```\n\n## Credentials and Region\n\nThis action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.\nUse [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.\n\nWe recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:\n* Do not store credentials in your repository\'s code.  You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.\n* [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository.

This will use Ninja to automatically build the project. Apart from that, no additional tasks are run.\n - `install`\n  Install the project. This will use Meson to install the project to the system.\n - `test`\n  Run unit tests. This will run any unit tests defined in the Meson project, using Meson.\n - `coverage`\n  Run [Gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/). This will use Meson to find the code coverage of the project.\n  Note that this required Gcovr. If it is not already installed, it will be installed automatically.\n - `tidy`\n  Run [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) on the project. This will use Meson to lint the project.\n  Note that this requires Clang-Tidy. If it is not installed, an error will occur.\n\n#### `directory`\nThe directory to build the project in.\nThis will automatically cause all of the commands to run the commands on whatever directory is specified here.\nBy default, the build directory will simply be `build`.\n\nThe build directory can already exist.\nIf the build directory exists before the action is run, it is checked for a `build.ninja` file.\nIf the directory and the `build.ninja` file already exist, nothing is done to setup the project.\nIf either of them are missing, the project is setup using `meson setup`.\n\n#### `setup-options`\nOptions to pass when setting up the project.\nThese are command line arguments that are passed to Meson when setting up the project.\nThis happens when either the `directory` specified or the `build.ninja` inside of the directory does not already exist.\nThis allows you to specify specific options to Meson to build with.\nThe options are passed directly to `meson setup`.\n\n#### `options`\nOptions to pass to the Meson command.\nThese are command line arguments that are passed to whatever Meson command is to be called.\nThis allows you to run the command with specific options.\nThe options are passed directly to whatever command is run without formatting.\n\n#### `meson-version`\nThe version of Meson to install.\nWhenever the action is initially run, it checks if Meson is installed.\nIf Meson is already installed, this part is skipped.\nNote that this means that it won't garuantee that a specific version of Meson is installed.\nIf Meson is not installed when the action is run, it will install it using pip and this version.\n\n#### `ninja-version`\nThe version of Ninja to install.\nWhenever the action is initially run, it checks if Ninja is installed.\nIf Ninja is already installed, this part is skipped.\nNote that this means that it won't garuantee that a specific version of Ninja is installed.\nIf Ninja is not installed when the action is run, it will be installed using pip and this version.\n\n#### `gcovr-version`\nThe version of Gcovr to install.\nWhenever the `coverage` action is run, Gcovr is checked if it is installed.\nIf not, pip will be used to install this version of Gcovr.\n\n### Additional info\nHere is just a little bit of additional information to explain some things that may not be trivial.\n\n#### Lifecycle\nThe lifecycle of the action is fairly important.\nLuckily, it is fairly simple.\nHere is what it looks like:\n\n 1. Process the inputs.\n  First, we need to get all of our inputs and figure out what exactly they are. The main part of this step is to format the `action` input. We just need to make sure it is a valid value.\n 2. Check for Ninja.\n  Next, we need to make sure Ninja is installed. Ninja is a dependency of Meson, so we do a simple check if it is on the current system. If not, it is installed through pip.\n 3. Check for Meson.\n  We also need to make sure Meson is installed. If Meson is not already installed, it is installed through pip.\n 4. Check if the project is setup.\n  We need to check if the project is setup. This will check if the build directory exists and if the `build.ninja` file exists in that directory. If either of those are missing, a `meson setup` command will be called to setup the project. If either of those are missing even after running the setup command, it is assumed that the project has an error, and it exits.\n 5. Build the command.\n  Next, we build the command that is to be run. Based on the action to run, an executable and basic set of arguments are selected that correspond to that command. Any dependencies (i.e. Gcovr or Clang-Tidy) are also installed if their respective actions are used. Finally, the `options` input is appended to the arguments.\n 6. Run the command.\n  Finally, we run the command that was built in the previous step.\n\n## License\n\nThe scripts and documentation in this project are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

For example:\n\n```yaml\n  defaults:\n    run:\n      shell: msys2 {0}\n  steps:\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n      install: >-\n        curl\n        git\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n```\n\n### Build matrix\n\nIt is common to test some package/tool on multiple environments, which typically requires installing different sets of\npackages through option `install`.\nGitHub Actions\' `strategy` and `matrix` fields allow to do so, as explained in [docs.github.com: Configuring a build matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix)\nand [docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix).\nSee, for instance:\n\n```yml\n  strategy:\n    matrix:\n      include:\n        - { sys: mingw64, env: x86_64 }\n        - { sys: mingw32, env: i686 }\n        - { sys: ucrt64,  env: ucrt-x86_64 }\n        - { sys: clang64, env: clang-x86_64 }\n  steps:\n    - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n      with:\n        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n        install: mingw-w64-${{matrix.env}}-openssl\n```\n\nAlternatively, option `pacboy` allows using a single matrix variable:\n\n```yml\n  strategy:\n    matrix:\n      sys:\n        - mingw64\n        - mingw32\n        - ucrt64\n        - clang64\n  steps:\n    - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n      with:\n        msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n        pacboy: openssl:p\n```\n\nFurthermore, [.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml](.github/workflows/PKGBUILD.yml) is a [Reusable Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)\nto build and test a package in GitHub Actions using a PKGBUILD recipe.\nIt can be used along with [matrix](./matrix) (a [Composite Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)),\nas shown in [.github/workflows/Tool.yml](.github/workflows/Tool.yml).\n\nNote: By default, GitHub Actions terminates any running jobs if any job in matrix\nfails. This default behavior can be disabled by setting `fail-fast: false` in\nstrategy section. See\n[docs.github.com: `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategyfail-fast)\nfor more details.\n\nFind similar patterns in the following workflows:\n\n- [examples/cmake.yml](examples/cmake.yml)\n- [msys2/MINGW-packages: .github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)\n\nFind further details at [#171](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/171#issuecomment-961458598) and [#102](https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2/issues/102).\n\n### Options\n\n#### msystem\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `MSYS | MINGW64 | MINGW32 | UCRT64 | CLANG32 | CLANG64 | CLANGARM64`\n* Default: `MINGW64`\n\nThe default [environment](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) that is used in the `msys2` command/shell provided by this action.\n\nMSYS2 recommends `UCRT64` nowadays as the default instead of `MINGW64`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: UCRT64\n```\n\nThe environment can be later overridden using the `MSYSTEM` environment variable if needed.\nThis is useful when multiple commands need to be executed in different contexts.\nFor example, in order to build a PKGBUILD file and then test the installed artifact:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: MSYS\n  - shell: msys2 {0}\n    run: |\n      makepkg-mingw -sCLfc --noconfirm --noprogressbar\n      pacman --noconfirm -U mingw-w64-*-any.pkg.tar.xz\n  - run: |\n      set MSYSTEM=UCRT64\n      msys2 -c \'<command to test the package>\'\n```\n\n#### update\n\n* Type: `boolean`\n* Default: `false`\n\nBy default, the installation is not updated; hence package versions are those of the installation tarball.\nBy setting option `update` to `true`, the action will update the package database and all already installed packages.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n```\n\n#### install\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: a whitespace separated list of packages\n* Default: -\n\nInstalling additional packages after updating the system is supported through option `install`.\nThe package or list of packages are installed through `pacman --noconfirm -S --needed --overwrite *`.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      update: true\n      install: >-\n        git\n        curl\n```\n\n#### pacboy\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: s whitespace separated list of packages\n* Default: -\n\nInstalling additional packages with [pacboy](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-naming/#avoiding-writing-long-package-names) after updating the system is supported through option `pacboy`.\nThe package or list of packages are installed through `pacboy --noconfirm -S --needed`.\n\n```yaml\n  strategy:\n    fail-fast: false\n    matrix:\n      sys: [ MINGW64, MINGW32, UCRT64, CLANG64 ]\n  steps:\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      msystem: ${{matrix.sys}}\n      install: >-\n        git\n        curl\n      pacboy: >-\n        openssl:p\n```\n\n#### platform-check-severity\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `warn | fatal`\n* Default: `warn`\n\nBy default (`fatal`), throw an error if the runner OS is not Windows.\nIf set to `warn`, simply log a message and skip the rest:\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      platform-check-severity: warn\n```\n\n### Advanced Options\n\nThese options are rarely needed and shouldn\'t be used unless there is a good reason.\n\n#### path-type\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Allowed values: `minimal | strict | inherit`\n* Default: `minimal`\n\nDefines which parts of the Windows `$env:PATH` environment variable leak into the MSYS2 environment.\nAllowed values:\n\n- `strict`: do not inherit anything from `$env:PATH`.\n- `minimal` *(default)*: only inherit the default Windows paths from `$env:PATH` (so that `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`\n  are available for example).\n- `inherit`: inherit everything; warning: this can lead to interference with other tools installed on the system.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      path-type: minimal\n```\n\nThis option corresponds to the `MSYS2_PATH_TYPE` setting in MSYS2; hence it can be overridden per step through `env`.\nSee [msys2/MSYS2-packages: filesystem/profile](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/blob/915946a637e1f2b7e26e32782f3af322009293db/filesystem/profile#L28-L45)\nfor further details about the configuration of each option.\n\n#### cache\n\n* Type: `boolean`\n* Default: `true`\n\nBy default (`true`), caches various things between runs to make repeated runs faster.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      cache: false\n```\n\n#### location\n\n* Type: `string`\n* Default: -\n\nSpecify an alternate location where to install MSYS2 to.\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      location: D:\\\n```\n\n#### release\n\n* Type: `boolean`\n* Default: `true`\n\nIf `true` (the default) it makes a fresh install of the latest MSYS2 installer release.\nIf `false` it will try to re-use the [existing MSYS2 installation](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#msys2) which is part of the official [GitHub Actions Runner Images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).\n\n```yaml\n  - uses: msys2/setup-msys2@v2\n    with:\n      release: false\n```\n\n## Known Problems\n\n### actions/checkout and line endings\n\nIn case you use the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action in your workflow and haven\'t configured git attributes for line endings, then git might auto convert your text files in the git repo to Windows line endings, which might lead to problems with tools provided by MSYS2.\n\nTo work around this issue disable the auto conversion before running `actions/checkout`:\n\n```yaml\n  steps:\n  - run: git config --global core.autocrlf input\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n```\n'","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

So, from `v5` it\'s required to specify a full and valid version of Poetry desired to be installed #16\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install latest available version of Poetry\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: ""3.11""\n  - uses: Gr1N/setup-poetry@v8\n  - run: poetry --version\n```\n\n### Exact version of Poetry to install, using SemVer\'s version syntax\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: ""3.11""\n  - uses: Gr1N/setup-poetry@v8\n    with:\n      poetry-version: ""1.2.2""\n  - run: poetry --version\n```\n\n### Allow to install prerelease versions of Poetry\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: ""3.11""\n  - uses: Gr1N/setup-poetry@v8\n    with:\n      poetry-preview: true\n  - run: poetry --version\n```\n\n### Cache dependencies to speed up workflows\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: ""3.11""\n  - uses: Gr1N/setup-poetry@v8\n  - uses: actions/cache@v2\n    with:\n      path: ~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs\n      key: ${{ runner.os }}-poetry-${{ hashFiles(\'poetry.lock\') }}\n  - run: poetry --version\n```\n\n### Configure Poetry using environment variables\n\nPoetry can be configured using environment variables and in case of CI/CD it can be a preferred way for you.\n\nA full list of available settings can be found at [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#using-environment-variables).\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: ""3.11""\n  - uses: Gr1N/setup-poetry@v8\n  - run: poetry --version\n    env:\n      POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_PATH: /path/to/virtualenvs/directory\n      POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_MY_REPOSITORY_PASSWORD: secret\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit any PR you want, they are always welcome.\n\n## License\n\n`setup-poetry` is licensed under the MIT license.

230,"b""# GitHub Action to deploy an MkDocs site to GitHub Pages\n\n![GitHub Badge](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages/workflows/Build/badge.svg)\n\nThis GitHub action will deploy your [MkDocs site](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme. It assumes that an `mkdocs.yml` file is present in the top-level directory and the source files (Markdown, etc.) are in the `docs/` folder. You can use [mhausenblas/mkdocs-template](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mkdocs-template) as a template.\n\n> Before you start, make sure you enable GitHub pages via the repo settings.\n\nThere are two methods for generating and building your `gh-pages` branch: use either a `PERSONAL_TOKEN` which is loaded with a personal access token containing *repo* privileges, or using `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is a token provided by the GITHUB API with sufficient privileges to perform repo-related operations.\n\n### Building with `PERSONAL_TOKEN`\n\n[Generate a personal access token (scope `repo`)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and [create a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository settings with the name `PERSONAL_TOKEN` and the value of the token generated.\n\nNote that this is an account-level token that has access to update **any** repo owned by you, so be sure to avoid sharing it.\n\n### Building with `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n\nThis action supports building and deploying with a `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This token is automatically generated by Github Actions when a workflow runs so it is convenient.\n\nIt is more **secure** than a personal token, since you never actually see the value of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and also the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to only work for a **single** repo.\n\nYou may need to give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permission. Go to your repository's **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions** and select **Read and write permissions**.\n\nNote that for this approach, Github Pages will be enabled in Settings but you will _not_ have a URL displayed or environment tab yet. So change the Github Pages settings to another target and then back again to `gh-pages` (if that is your branch to serve) - then you will see a URL. This step is only needed on the _first_ deploy and no action is needed later on.\n\n### Alternative `GITHUB_DOMAIN`\n\nIn case this action should be used in a Github Enterprise environment you can overwrite the `github.com` domain with your corresponding Github Enterprise domain name by specifying the `GITHUB_DOMAIN` environment variable.\n\n### Custom domain for github pages\n\nMkDocs can be deployed to github pages using a custom domain, if you populate a `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` environment variable. This will generate a CNAME file, which will be placed inside the `/docs` folder.\n\nhttps://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#custom-domains\n\n### Custom File Pathing of Mkdocs file\n\nThis action supports deployment of mkdocs with different file path , if you populate a `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. This is important if you have mkdocs file in another folder such as if you have `mkdocs.yml` in a path `docs/mkdocs.yml`. Without populating this, the deployment assumes that `mkdocs.yml` is on the root folder.\n\n## Installing extra packages\n\nSome Python packages require C bindings. These packages can be installed using the `EXTRA_PACKAGES` variable. The `EXTRA_PACKAGES` variable will be passed to the `apk add` command of Alpine Linux before running `pip install` to install the Python packages.\n\n## Installing mkdocs plugins\n\nIf you use some mkdocs plugins like [`codeinclude`](https://github.com/rnorth/mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin) then you need to define it as dependency in the typical python way with a `requirements.txt` file. In the sample above you need to add the line `mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin`. Then you need to link the file using the `REQUIREMENTS` variable.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```shell\nname: Publish docs via GitHub Pages\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Deploy docs\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout main\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Deploy docs\n        uses: mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages@master\n        # Or use mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages@nomaterial to build without the mkdocs-material theme\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          CUSTOM_DOMAIN: optionaldomain.com\n          CONFIG_FILE: folder/mkdocs.yml\n          EXTRA_PACKAGES: build-base\n          # GITHUB_DOMAIN: github.myenterprise.com\n          REQUIREMENTS: folder/requirements.txt\n```\n""","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),1,tensor(1),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0),0,tensor(0)

If set to false, the action won\'t fetch the repo.\n    # For more info as to why fetching is usually recommended, please see the ""Performance on large repos"" FAQ. \n    # Default: --tags --force\n    fetch: false\n\n    # The message for the commit.\n    # Default: \'Commit from GitHub Actions (name of the workflow)\'\n    message: \'Your commit message\'\n\n    # If this input is set, the action will push the commit to a new branch with this name.\n    # Default: \'\'\n    new_branch: custom-new-branch\n\n    # The way the action should handle pathspec errors from the add and remove commands.

It\'s important to note that these arguments **are not actually used with a CLI command**, but they are parsed by a package called [`string-argv`](https://npm.im/string-argv), and then used with [`simple-git`](https://npm.im/simple-git).  \nWhat does this mean for you? It means that strings that contain a lot of nested quotes may be parsed incorrectly, and that specific ways of declaring arguments may not be supported by these libraries. If you\'re having issues with your argument strings you can check whether they\'re being parsed correctly either by [enabling debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging) for your workflow runs or by testing it directly with `string-argv` ([RunKit demo](https://npm.runkit.com/string-argv)): if each argument and option is parsed correctly you\'ll see an array where every string is an option or value.\n\n### Adding files\n\nThe action adds files using a regular `git add` command, so you can put every kind of argument in the `add` option. For example, if you want to force-add a file: `./path/to/file.txt --force`.  \nThe script will not stop if one of the git commands doesn\'t match any file. E.g.: if your command shows a ""fatal: pathspec \'yourFile\' did not match any files"" error the action will go on.  \nYou can also use JSON or YAML arrays (e.g. `\'[""first"", ""second""]\'`, `""[\'first\', \'second\']""`) to make the action run multiple `git add` commands: the action will log how your input has been parsed. Please mind that your input still needs to be a string because of how GitHub Actions works with inputs: just write your array inside the string, the action will parse it later.\n\n### Deleting files\n\nThe `remove` option can be used if a predetermined list of files needs to be removed. It runs the `git rm` command, so you can pass every kind of argument with it. As if with the [`add` input](#adding-files), you can also use JSON or YAML arrays to make the action run multiple `git rm` commands.\n \nIf you want deleted files to be auto-detected and committed, you can use the [`--no-ignore-removal`/`-A`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#Documentation/git-add.txt--A) git arguments.\n\n### Pushing\n\nBy default the action runs the following command: `git push origin ${new_branch input} --set-upstream`. You can use the `push` input to modify this behavior, here\'s what you can set it to:\n\n- `true`: this is the default value, it will behave as usual.\n- `false`: this prevents the action from pushing at all, no `git push` command is run.\n- any other string:  \n  The action will use your string as the arguments for the `git push` command. Please note that nothing is used other than your arguments, and the command will result in `git push ${push input}` (no remote, no branch, no `--set-upstream`, you have to include them yourself).\n\nOne way to use this is if you want to force push to a branch of your repo: you\'ll need to set the `push` input to, for example, `origin yourBranch --force`.\n\n### Creating a new branch\n\nIf you want the action to commit in a new branch, you can use the `new_branch` input.\n\nPlease note that if the branch exists, the action will still try push to it, but it\'s possible that the push will be rejected by the remote as non-straightforward.\n\nIf that\'s the case, you need to make sure that the branch you want to commit to is already checked out before you run the action.  \nIf you\'re **really** sure that you want to commit to that branch, you can also force-push by setting the `push` input to something like `origin yourBranchName --set-upstream --force`.\n\nIf you want to commit files ""across different branches"", here are two ways to do it:\n\n1. You can check them out in two different directories, generate your files, move them to your destination and then run `add-and-commit` in the destination directory using the `cwd` input.\n2. You can manually commit those files with `git` commands as you would on your machine. There are several ways to do this depending on the scenario. One of them if to stash your changes, checkout the destination branch, and popping the stash. You can then use the `add-and-commit` action as usual. Please note that this is just an example and may not work for you, since your use case may be different.\n\n### Tagging\n\nYou can use the `tag` option to enter the arguments for a `git add` command. In order for the action to isolate the tag name from the rest of the arguments, it should be the first word not preceded by an hyphen (e.g. `-a tag-name -m ""some other stuff""` is ok).  \nYou can also change the arguments of the push command for tags: every argument in the `tag_push` input will be appended to the `git push --tags` command.  \nFor more info on how git arguments are parsed, see [the ""Git arguments"" section](#git-arguments).\n\n## Outputs\n\nThe action provides these outputs:\n\n- `committed`: whether the action has created a commit (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)\n- `commit_long_sha`: the full SHA of the commit that has just been created\n- `commit_sha`: the short 7-character SHA of the commit that has just been created\n- `pushed`: whether the action has pushed to the remote (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)\n- `tagged`: whether the action has created a tag (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)\n- `tag_pushed`: whether the action has pushed a tag (`\'true\'` or `\'false\'`)\n\nFor more info on how to use outputs, see [""Context and expression syntax""](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Working with PRs\n\nBy default, when you use `actions/checkout` on a PR, it will checkout the head commit in a detached head state.\nIf you want to make some changes, you have to checkout the branch the PR is coming from in the head repo.  \nYou can set it up like this:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  with:\n    repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}\n    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}\n```\n\nYou can find the full docs for payloads of `pull_request` events [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#webhook-payload-example-32).\n\nIf you\'re planning on running this only on ""internal"" PRs (where head and base are in the same repo) then you can omit the `repository` input.  \nIf you\'re planning to use this with PRs coming from other forks, please keep in mind that you might not have write access to those repos.\nYou can try setting up the repo with your PAT, as explained in the [""About tokens"" paragraph](#about-tokens) of this section.\n\nKeep in mind that this ""custom checkout"" is meant only for PRs: if your workflow runs on multiple events (like `push` or `workflow_dispatch`), you could try having this step run only for `pull_request` events, while other ones will trigger the usual checkout.  \nIf you wish to do so, you can use the `step.if` property, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif)\'s the docs.\n\n### About tokens\n\nWhen pushing, the action uses the token that the local git repository has been configured with: that means that if you want to change it you\'ll need to do it in the steps that run before this action. For example: if you set up your repo with [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/) then you have to add the token there.  \nChanging the token with which the repo is configured can be useful if you want to run CI checks on the commit pushed by this action; anyway, it has to be set up outside of this action.\n\nThe action automatically gets the GitHub token from a `github_token` input: this input should not be modified by the user, since it doesn\'t affect the commits as it\'s only used to access the GitHub API to get user info, in case they selected that option for the commit author.\n\n### The commit from the action is not triggering CI!\n\nThat\'s because you\'re checking out the repo using the built-in [`GITHUB_TOKEN` secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication): GitHub sees that the push event has been triggered by a commit generated by CI, and doesn\'t run any further checks to avoid unintentional check loops.\n\n**If you\'re sure** that you want the commits generated during CI to trigger other workflow runs, you can checkout the repo using a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token): this will make the resulting commit the same as if you made it yourself.  \nIf you\'re using `actions/checkout`, check out their [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to set your repo token.\n\n### About `actions/checkout`\n\nThe token you use when setting up the repo with this action will determine what token `add-and-commit` will use.  \nSome users reported that they were getting an error:\n\n```\n> fatal: could not read Username for \'https://github.com\': No such device or address\n```\n\nIf you\'re getting this error and you\'re using `actions/checkout@v1`, try upgrading to `actions/checkout@v2`. If you\'re still having problems after upgrading, feel free to open an issue. Issue ref: [#146](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit/issues/146)\n\n### Performance on large repos\n\nBy default, the action will fetch the repository before starting to work on it: this ensures that it can see the already existing refs.  \n\nWhen working with a repository that has a lot of branches and tags, fetching it can take a long time. If the fetch step is taking too much time, you can decide to skip it by setting the `fetch` input to `false`: this will prevent the action from running `git fetch` altogether. \n\nPlease note that you have to set up your workflow accordingly: not fetching the repo can impact branch and tag creation within the action, and for this reason it\'s recommended to disable it only if necessary. Issue ref: [#386](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit/issues/386)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Different author/committer configurations\n\nIf you don\'t want to use your GitHub username for the CI commits, you can use the `default_author` input to make it appear as if it was made by ""GitHub Actions"", by setting its value to `github_actions`.\n\n<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/115738624-80b51780-a38d-11eb-9bbe-77461654274c.png"" height=40/>\n\n```yaml\non: push\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9\n        with:\n          default_author: github_actions\n```\n\nYou can also use the `committer_name` and `committer_email` inputs to make it appear as if GitHub Actions is the committer, here are a couple of example steps:\n\n<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/130594168-1d910710-e2d0-4b06-9324-cbe5dde59154.png"" height=70/>\n\n```yaml\n- uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9\n  with:\n    message: Show GitHub Actions logo\n    committer_name: GitHub Actions\n    committer_email: actions@github.com\n```\n\n<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26386270/130594443-b881fae7-3064-4020-a4cc-6db37ef0df65.png"" height=70/>\n\n```yaml\n- uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9\n  with:\n    message: Show GitHub logo\n    committer_name: GitHub Actions\n    committer_email: 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\n```\n\n### Automated linting\n\nDo you want to lint your JavaScript files, located in the `src` folder, with ESLint, so that fixable changes are done without your intervention? You can use a workflow like this:\n\n```yaml\nname: Lint source code\non: push\n\njobs:\n  run:\n    name: Lint with ESLint\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm install\n\n      - name: Update source code\n        run: eslint ""src/**"" --fix\n\n      - name: Commit changes\n        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9\n        with:\n          author_name: Your Name\n          author_email: mail@example.com\n          message: \'Your commit message\'\n          add: \'*.js\'\n```\n\n### Running the action in a different directory\n\nIf you need to run the action on a repository that is not located in [`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables), you can use the `cwd` option: the action uses a `cd` normal command, so the path should follow bash standards.\n\n```yaml\nname: Use a different repository directory\non: push\n\njobs:\n  run:\n    name: Add a text file\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      # If you need to, you can check out your repo to a different location\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          path: \'./pathToRepo/\'\n\n      # You can make whatever type of change to the repo...\n      - run: echo ""123"" > ./pathToRepo/file.txt\n\n      # ...and then use the action as you would normally do, but providing the path to the repo\n      - uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9\n        with:\n          message: \'Add the very useful text file\'\n          add: \'*.txt --force\'\n          cwd: \'./pathToRepo/\'\n```\n\n##

241,"b'# MySQL GitHub Action [![Test status](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/actions)\n\nThis [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) sets up a MySQL database in Docker.\n\nIt supports various MySQL options to accurately configure and execute MySQL. So it may not be your best choice when you just want to run a simple MySQL, see [The Default MySQL](#the-default-mysql).\n\nIt is based on the Docker container and is limited by Github Actions, which contains only Linux now. Therefore it does not work in Mac OS and Windows environment.\n\n## Usage\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n- uses: mirromutth/mysql-action@v1.1\n  with:\n    host port: 3800 # Optional, default value is 3306. The port of host\n    container port: 3307 # Optional, default value is 3306. The port of container\n    character set server: \'utf8\' # Optional, default value is \'utf8mb4\'. The \'--character-set-server\' option for mysqld\n    collation server: \'utf8_general_ci\' # Optional, default value is \'utf8mb4_general_ci\'. The \'--collation-server\' option for mysqld\n    mysql version: \'8.0\' # Optional, default value is ""latest"". The version of the MySQL\n    mysql database: \'some_test\' # Optional, default value is ""test"". The specified database which will be create\n    mysql root password: ${{ secrets.RootPassword }} # Required if ""mysql user"" is empty, default is empty. The root superuser password\n    mysql user: \'developer\' # Required if ""mysql root password"" is empty, default is empty. The superuser for the specified database. Can use secrets, too\n    mysql password: ${{ secrets.DatabasePassword }} # Required if ""mysql user"" exists. The password for the ""mysql user""\n```\n\nIf want bind MySQL host port to 3306, please see [The Default MySQL](#the-default-mysql).\n\nSee [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) for available MySQL versions.\n\nSee [Creating and using secrets (encrypted variables)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) for hiding database password.\n\n## The Default MySQL\n\nMySQL *may* be installed and started by Github Actions (aka. the Default MySQL), that version is 5.7 generally, root superuser password is ""root"" and port is 3306. See [Software in virtual environments for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions).\n\nSo before set-up a MySQL which host port is 3306 in Docker, please make sure the Default MySQL has been shutted-down. Otherwise, action will fail and print an error log that looks like: `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3306: bind: address already in use.` (See [#2](https://github.com/mirromutth/mysql-action/issues/2))\n\nSure, if you do not care about MySQL options, such as version, bound port, character set, character collation, root password, etc., you can use the Default MySQL instead of this Action.\n\n### Shutdown the Default MySQL\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-${{ ubuntu-version }} # is Ubuntu environment\n\n    # ... some other config ...\n\n    steps:\n    - # ... some prepare steps, like action/checkout, run some script without MySQL, etc.\n\n    - name: Shutdown Ubuntu MySQL (SUDO)\n      run: sudo service mysql stop # Shutdown the Default MySQL, ""sudo"" is necessary, please not remove it\n\n    - # ... some steps before set-up MySQL ...\n    - name: Set up MySQL\n      uses: mirromutth/mysql-action@v1.1\n      with:\n        # ...
